To understand CHIM you must firstly understand that the whole of the TES
universe is the dream of the Godhead, an unknown entity turned schizophrenic by
the raging battle between the “Order” of Anu and the “Change” of Padomay. This
“dream” is subgradient which means that each level of the dream (Void to Aurbis
to Mundus) are lesser parts of the dream. Therefore all the beings seen in the
Elder Scrolls games are parts of the Godhead, as is the player character
him/herself.

CHIM, is the realisation that you are a part of this Godhead whilst also being
an individual within it. Failure to realise the second part leads to
zero-summing, which is blanking out of the dream. It is called zero-summing
because of the equation that is needed to attain CHIM. In order to attain CHIM
you must balance the “I AM” (of existence) and the “I AM NOT” (of non-existence)
and still conclude that “I AM” or adding 1 and -1 and still getting 1. If you
get 0, you zero-sum out of existence, which is not desired.

Examples of those who have attained CHIM are Talos and Vivec. They attained CHIM
by using the method of the Tower which is explained by Vivec himself in [his
teachings][1]. In order to find the Tower you must first see [the wheel][2],
which is the structure of the TES universe. In the centre you have Mundus which
is the hub of the wheel. The 8 spokes of the wheel are the 8 givers who are
known best as the 8 Divines. The gaps between these 8 spokes number 16 and
represent the 16 Daedric Princes.

As Vivec states. Look at the Wheel sideways and you see the “I” of the Godhead.
The singular which dreams the plurals. This sudden realisation is what
kickstarts CHIM. This quote, however, shows more than how to reach CHIM, it also
explains Lorkhan’s purpose. Lorkhan saw the Tower without the Wheel when he
travelled to the edge of the Aurbis:

Lorkhan saw the Tower and realised that he was a part of the Godhead but somehow
he did not attain CHIM and neither did he zero-sum. What we do know though is
that it inspired him to create Mundus. He created it so others could attain
CHIM:

In order to understand CHIM though you must also understand Love. In order to
truly attain CHIM you must also [Know Love][3] although it is true to say that
attaining CHIM is actually an act of Egotistic Altruism. Both Vivec and Talos
loved themselves so much that by proxy they loved everything else because they
were also it. By that logic the applications of CHIM are also bound by Love.
After achieving CHIM you become a lucid dreamer within the dream and can begin
to change and manipulate the dream since you intimately know the land beneath
your feet like you know your hands. However, as I previously stated the CHIM’s
uses are bound by Love and therefore the only examples we have of CHIM’s uses
are through Love:

> “You have suffered for me to win this throne, and I see how you hate jungle.
> Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my

>
> —[From the Many-Headed Talos][4] (recited by Heimskr)

Talos loved his warriors and used CHIM to change the landscape of Cyrodiil from
jungle to the grasslands we see in Oblivion.
