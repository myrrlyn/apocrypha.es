The two Altmer walked along the rough path. They were heading deep into the
woods east of the Niben Bay, where scouts had finally tracked the traitor. The
lanky Justiciar emptied his mind as they plodded forward, pulling all his
magicka reserves up and readying them. His partner, a great brute of a soldier,
walked ahead of him, guiding him down the path so his mind could fully prepare
for what was sure to be an uproarious battle. They climbed a small hill, and
several things happened at once.

They saw a shack, small and secluded beneath a great tree. From the shack burst
a light, and power radiated out of it, streaming away into the air. It snapped
the Justiciar to; he readied a spell and hissed to the solider “Get down!” But
as soon as the light had come, it was gone. Cautiously, the pair approached the
shack. Just as the soldier made to force the door in, a tired voice sounded from
within, saying, “Come in, then.” The two exchanged a surprised look, then opened
the door. Sitting there amidst piles of books were three large chairs, one of
which was occupied. Staring up at the two was an incredibly old-looking Altmer.

“Please, young mage,” he said, “still your spells. Or are you so oblivious that
you cannot see that I have no strength left to resist you?” The Justiciar
reluctantly let the magicka slip back from his fingertips, but the soldier kept
his sword drawn, and raised as if to strike the old mer. There was a twinkle in
his eyes, despite his apparent exhaustion. He motioned to the chairs. “Sit,
please. All this taking and breaking in is such tiring work. Rest for a moment,
and explain who sent you. For I am curious which will win out, my being kin, or
my being a Blade.”

The Justiciar spoke up, “We are here on orders from Alinor. You are to be
brought back for reeducation, as your rebellion has been a thorn in our sides
for too long.” The old elf chuckled. “A fair assessment, I suppose, glossing
over the major details as usual. Your Thalmor’ve never been a group for details,
only results. Wine?” At this, he made to grab a glass bottle on the floor by his
chair, but the soldier saw his movement and stepped forward. The old elf’s eyes
darted to the blade as it came down, and with a swift movement, he knocked the
blow aside, embedding the soldier’s sword in his floorboards. “Honestly, you
great buffoon, if I had the strength left to kill you, I would have. Your damn
scout’s already took too much out of me as it is.” He picked up the bottle and
motioned behind his chair. A Thalmor scout lay there, dead, and oddly pale. “Now
then, shall I drink alone?”

The Justiciar reluctantly sank into the chair closest to the door, and forced
the soldier to the chair between him and the old elf. The soldier refused wine,
but the Justiciar reluctantly agreed, provided he saw the old elf drink first.
He did, but even so, he cast a few spells to detect poisons, but found nothing.
This amused the old elf. “It’s vintage 3E401, you fool. Not even the most
cruel-hearted of assassins would dare add anything to this masterpiece. In fact,
this is my last bottle. Smuggled it out of the Summurset Isles myself. Oh, I
mean, out of *Alinor* myself. Of course.”

“Now then, down to business.” He set his glass down, and with obvious effort,
cast a little, flickering candlelight above them. “You’re here to take me back,
and well enough. It’s been too long since I’ve gazed upon the best our culture
has to offer, but I suppose we won’t be going through Valenwood then, shall we?
And I suppose you’ll want me to… oh, what is that phrase… ah! *Come quietly*, as
it were?” Something about the old elf’s tone set the Justiciar on edge. “Enough
talk, we’re going now.” Even as the words dribbled out of his mouth, they fell
flat to the floor. The old elf pressed on, “Oh, but must we? There’s so much I
want to hear propaganda about, and I must finish off that vintage. Oh, but I
suppose you must believe our homeland’s always been Alinor, am I right, whelp?
Are you even old enough to wear those robes, boy?”

The Justiciar bristled. “I am one-hundred forty and seven years old, and I
daresay I’ve been taught more about magic than you’ve ever forgotten, you old
fool!” The soldier was silent, knowing that if he restrained his partner there
would be punishment later. “One hundred forty-seven years old, eh? I’ve lived
four of your lives, and I’m damned close to a fifth. ‘Learned more than I’ve
forgotten indeed’… I suppose you know the answer to the oh-so-important question
of the Khajiit, then, yes? Was your little experiment worth it?” A befuddled
look came over the Justiciar’s face. “Experiment?” he asked, “What experiment
are you talking about?”

The old elf’s eyes twitched to the body of the slain scout for the smallest of
moments, and he cracked a wry smile. “So, they never told you young ones, then.
Khajiit were mer once, if you can believe it. Your Thalmor experimented on them
to see if making the moons disappear would make them revert to Aldmer, only I
suppose they failed, as per usual, seeing as Void Nights Khajiit are still
beasts, not mer.” The Justiciar stared in disbelief. “That’s… ridiculous. I’ve
had quite enough of your stories, old fool. It’s time to go!” And with that, he
and his partner rose as if it had been agreed upon beforehand. His partner
worked his sword out of the floor. But the old elf sat quite still, pensively
sipping his wine. The Justiciar pulled magicka down and readied a spell of
binding. “Get up, you old fool, it’s time to go!”

The old elf looked up at him. Their eyes locked for the briefest of moments. He
threw his glass, wine and all, into the face of the Justiciar. Even as the
Justiciar cried out in pain, the soldier’s sword found itself embedded in the
old elf’s chest.

To the amazement of the soldier, he smiled. “So… Now, you’ve actually… actually
done it. Damn fools…” He choked, even as blood began to flow from his chest. The
Justiciar raked him with lightning in his rage, before casting a spell of
binding on him. They set a fire in the shack after combing through it for texts
the old Blade would have found useful, and began their slow trek back to the
prison below the Bay. A quick healing potion fixed the Justiciar’s problems, and
every so often he would stop to have the soldier beat the old elf. The spell of
binding would keep him alive until his use was ended. Sometimes the beatings
lasted for ten minutes or more. It wasn’t until midmorning that the odd trio
finally reached the shores of the Niben Bay. They brought him to the prison
beneath the Bay, where he was questioned thoroughly by the best torturers in the
Dominion. It was decided that he could not be sent to Alinor due to the actions
of the pair, and they were sent in his place for reeducation.

But the old elf began to fade. The torture began to weaken the spell of binding,
and each day he felt himself slipping further and further. Finally, after an
endless reality of torture, he broke.

A scribe was brought in, and what follows is his account of the confession of
the last Altmer Blade:

> Prisoner 093471: I killed him. Broke his soul. Used it to tell them… Told
