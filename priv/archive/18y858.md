The mammoths of Skyrim are truly remarkable creatures, standing nearly twenty
feet tall, and covered in fur. A long snout and four ivory tusks protrude from
its face, making the beast easily recognizable. They can be found in many of
Skyrimâ€™s holds, in particular, Whiterun, the Pale, and Eastmarch. They are often
seen alongside the fearsome giants, which may explain why little is truly known
about the mammoths. The aim of this essay is to provide some insight on these
magnificent creatures.

Firstly, what is the relationship between the mammoths and the giants? We know
that the giants herd the mammoths, but to what end? Sacks of mammoth cheese can
be found in most giant camps, suggesting that the giants rely on them for food,
but it seems that the mammoths are not seen as mere cattle, but are prized
companions. Giant-tamed mammoths are distinguishable by the [intricate carvings
in their tusks][0], revealing that a great deal of care is shown towards them.

It is interesting to note that mammoth skulls found in the wild have no markings
upon their tusks. What happens to the remains of tamed mammoths? Some travelers
have observed giants standing forlornly beside mammoth corpses, as if they were
in mourning. While this may well be true, it may be that they are waiting for
the body to decompose so they can transport the bones to their camp. Indeed,
many [mammoth skulls][1] can be found in [giant camps][2], placed up high,
almost as if they were objects to be revered.

Some scholars say that the mammoths are held in such high regard because they
are, in fact, female giants. Needless to say, this has unpleasant implications,
but they reason that it is why there are only male giants in Skyrim. There are a
few flaws with this argument. If the absence of female giants can be explained
by this, then why do we not see any giant children? Furthermore, the existence
of wild mammoths shows that they can reproduce without the intervention of
giants.

It seems unlikely that the mammoths are used as mates, but the fact remains that giants hold them in great esteem. In comparison, the more civilized races of
Tamriel treat them terribly. It could still be said that we value them, though
mainly for their tusks, fur, and meat.

Mammoth tusks can be made into many things. When ground into a fine powder, a
tusk can be used as an ingredient in alchemy. It has the potential to restore
stamina, but can just as easily create a poison that causes a person to run away
in fear. Ultimately, it is not too useful, so people tend not to turn the tusks
into powder. As a result, this ingredient is very rare.

Tusks can also be used to create jewelry. Ivory rings are popular among the
upper class citizens of Skyrim. Not to mention, the tusks themselves are valued
as trophies.

The khajiit in particular seem to have an obsession with mammoth tusks and fur;
khajiit caravans in Skyrim seek the tusks, and traders as far as Anequina and
Pellitine are known to sell mammoth hides.

Furthermore, a mammoth has enough meat to feed a dozen people for over a month.
The snout is the tastiest part, but the rest of the meat is invaluable to
smaller communities.

It is regretful that we mainly interact with the mammoths by butchering them, as
they truly are wonderful beasts. While the giants are seen as uncivilized by
many, their relationship with the mammoths may just be something to be envied.
This is exemplified in the poem Ode to the Tundrastriders:

> One in nature, each relying upon the other, more than just man and beast, but
> equals who need one another to survive.
