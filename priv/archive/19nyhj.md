The races of Tamriel vary greatly, and as such, have different burial customs to
fit their differing cultures. This essay deals with the particularities of these
customs, and is split into two parts for the sake of convenience. This first
half will deal with the Altmer, Argonians, Bosmer, Bretons and finally Dunmer.

## Altmer

The Altmer have a great deal of respect for their ancestors, and treat their
remains with great care. Altmer are traditionally interred at the top of the
towers that dot the land of Alinor, with the taller towers being reserved for
more important people[^1] According to The Pocket Guide, 3^rd^ Edition,
Crystal-Like-Law was a resting place for many:

> When the Aldmer came together as a people to create the Crystal Tower, it was
> not a monument to any king or god, but rather to the spirit of the elven
> people, living and dead. Within the glittering walls of the Tower are housed
> the graves of the early Aldmeri settlers[^2]

When Crystal-Like-Law collapsed, the remains of many eminent figures were lost.

The Altmer have gained a notoriety for taking and slaying some babies, with the
goal of retaining racial purity[^3]. One can only hope that this is false, but
whether it is true or not, it is unlikely these infants would be given the honor
of being laid to rest in the towers.

## Argonians

Little is known about how the Argonians deal with their dead. The moist climate
of Black Marsh means that bodies rot very quickly; often, there is no need to
bury the deceased[^4].

The Argonians who live by the coast are inclined towards sea burials[^5], but
the actions of Sload necromancers has made this practice less desirable[^4]. In
general, it seems the Argonians do not care much about what happens to their
bodies[^6], though like all races, they would rather have their remains returned
to their homeland[^7].

## Bosmer

Some Bosmer adopt Imperial customs by burying their dead, but this is mostly
seen outside of Valenwood.[^4] A particularity of the Bosmer of Valenwood is
that they must not harm any plant life from within the province, in accordance
with the Green Pact made with Y’ffre. As such, they are strictly carnivorous,
and will even resort to cannibalism. In fact, the Meat Mandate, a section of the
Green Pact, says that the Bosmer must eat any enemy that they slay.[^3] This
reduces the number of bodies to bury, to an extent.

Another thing that is unique to the Bosmer is that they have the power to call
upon a primal ability called the “Wild Hunt”. In times of need, the Bosmer can
take on bestial forms, and mow down their opponents[^3]. The transformation is
permanent, and those who survive tend to turn on each other[^8]. While there
have been very few Wild Hunts in history, there is often a shortage of corpses
soon after one has taken place.

## Bretons

The Bretons, despite having come from the Altmer and Nedic people, have
developed customs that are very distinct from those of their ancestors. They are
nearly exclusively cremated in the northern parts of High Rock. This tradition
has survived centuries, but the fact that people in the south now tend toward
Imperial burials in graveyards shows the influence that Cyrodiil has had on the
Bretons[^4].

## Dunmer

Of all the races, we know perhaps the most about Dunmer burials. The Dark Elves
of Morrowind feel that it is their duty to treat their ancestors’ remains with
the utmost respect: the ancestors of the Dunmer can be called upon to serve them
even after death.

Due to the billowing of Red Mountain, the land of Vvardenfell, and parts of
mainland Morrowind have been showered with ash. The Dunmer feel that it is only
appropriate that they return to ash after death, and so they are almost
exclusively cremated. It would be unthinkable to leave them to rot, or to bury
them in the Imperial manner.

In the past, most would inter the remains of their ancestors in a City of the
Dead, with Necrom being the most famous. Necrom has traditionally been reserved
for model citizens and warriors, so most Dunmer are put to rest in family
ancestral tombs. Ashpits house the remains themselves, and offerings are made
periodically, to please the dead.

Previously, these tombs, and other lands belonging to the clan, were protected
by a ghost fence. The deceased would provide a bone which would then be
enchanted, and used to create a beacon, of sorts. Due to the spread of the
Corprus disease in the Third Era, the clan ghost fences were left untended in
favor of the Great Ghost Fence surrounding Red Mountain. A statement was
released by the Temple, asking people to contribute to the Great Ghost Fence,
and so it became convention to do so. Entire skeletons would be offered up, and
so the Dunmer would “venerate a small portion of their ancestor’s remains kept
at a local temple[^9].”

In the Fourth Era, the Dunmer were hit by a catastrophe. The eruption of Red
Mountain demolished most cities on Vvardenfell, and had terrible effects as far
south as [Tear][0][^10]. Most of Morrowind was ravaged, and many ancestral tombs
were completely destroyed. Following this, the Argonian invasion forced many to
flee the land[^11].

The Dunmer have gradually been forced to forgo their culture, but with the advent
of the New Temple, one can only hope that their previous burial customs will
begin to return.

Dunmer burial rituals comes from this one book, which is outdated. Seems strange
that I have the least references for the race whose customs I supposedly know
the most about.

it was sitting on a swamp, but even Mournhold was damaged to an extent, so I
imagine a lot of the tombs would have collapsed.
