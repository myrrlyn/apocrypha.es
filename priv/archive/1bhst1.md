So, traveler, from genesis to generations, we have arrived. The Aurbis stood
strong, offspring of order and chaos alike flourished. Many such beings, the
et’Ada, came to be. However, this place was still shapeless and without
character. As more lesser gods faced realization of their own presence, so did
they realize their own dislike of such emptiness. And as with all blank slates,
sooner or later somebody starts writing.

The greatest of these authors soon realized his talent for not only seeing what
is not there and what could come to be; but his talent for convincing his peers.
Some say convincing, others say manipulating. Which does not matter, for the
result remains the same. One Padomaic spirit of many names, Lorkhan; the
creator, the trickster, the tester; saw what this beginning place could become.
With a silver tongue and a boisterous spirit he went to the other et’Ada with
his plan.

Magnus, lord of magic and mystical things, agreed to be his architect. With his
servants, the Magne-Ge, Magnus set to work laying a schematic; stone, sod; bone,
blood; wisdom and will would all be his mortar. While the blueprint for
Lorkhan’s house was written, he approached others for investment.

Whether the implications of such a contribution was known to the et’Ada who
agreed, we cannot be sure. What we can be sure of, however, is those who laughed
at the face of a new world unbound did not forget Lorkhan’s ingenuity.

Many et’Ada went to craft their own lands, aspects of themselves. But, with
absolute control comes a plane of servants and slaves. Their realms would never
hold as high as the place that would soon be realized. The many heads of the
hydra snap and bite, unpredictable and beyond control. The serpent has only one
head, reigned by focus but chained by regal opinion. These kingdoms would
persist, but rarely prosper.

Should a wanderer such as yourself wish to see these realms with your own eyes,
do not be discouraged by the tumultuous nature that the Aurbis had become at
this stage. Already, many houses lie stable. The Pits, Peryite’s land of lava
and pestilence; it is advisable to receive proper vaccinations. The silver
towers of Moonshadow, blessed by Azura’s dawn and dusk; be cautious of what may
appear stunning or silent, this land of beauty hides many secrets. To run among
the Hunting Grounds and all it’s organic splendor, but be wary of Hircine’s
manbeast; adorned with tattoos of pursuits dictation, he is voracious.

With the turning of the heavens, Aka’s might passed for a period beyond metric.
Conflicts among the planes were rampant. Grudges were made and sides were
decided. Jyggalag, he who stood for absolute order; unwavering and unrelenting
to all he disparaged or disagreed; was punished for his lack of hubris and
hallowed ways. The et’Ada who were not burdened with Lorkhan’s task struck in
unison, cursing him to madness and schizophrenic duplicity. To march against his
own heart; both black and white, without rhyme or reason.

With the map drawn and the compass set; creation stood for those who would
follow Lorkhan’s pilgrimage of concept. Surrounded by the cycle of other
landscapes held firm by their creators, this new world stood at the center.
Unstable, uninspired and uninhabited; only the et’Ada at Lorkhan’s side were
left to lend their hands. And lend they did. However, with all hasty decisions
and uninformed investments, returns are not guaranteed.
