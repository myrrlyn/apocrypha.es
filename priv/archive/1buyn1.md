The tale begins with the Sow and its litter of little piglets. It was raising
its piglets, feeding them its milk, nourishing them with its love, and teaching
them to avoid dangerous predators, such as Snakes. The piglets loved the Sow,
and the Sow loved its piglets, and they were happy.

So of course a Snake came along. There is usually a Snake listening to your
conversations, no matter where you are, and this specific Snake was hiding
nearby, hiding beneath the corpse of the god that the Nords call Shor. It took
issue with the Sow’s lessons, its lessons of love and its lessons of avoiding
Snakes. It took issue with the Sow’s words and with the Sow’s care for its
litter.

The Snake rose up from beneath Shor’s corpse and said, “What lies do you teach
your children, Sow who killed Shor? You teach them to hide from Snakes, but
Snakes, such as I and Shor and others, teach the truth of the world. The world
is harsh. You soften your children, teaching them to hide in your shadow and
weep at the hardships of Nirn. You steer Aldmeris the way of stasis. And though
you teach them of love, you teach them of the wrong kind of love. You must teach
them of the Love that brings about ascendency, the Love of self and of all
others that is I ARE ALL WE, not this simpering, tearful sack of—”

And before the Snake had finished speaking, the Sow and its little litter were
laughing, laughing, tearful at the hilarity of the words of the Snake.

So the Snake ate the Sow amidst much spilled milk and panicked squealing.

And the Snake turned to the piglets, which were hurriedly gathering up the spilt
milk of the Sow, and the Snake said, “See? The Sow was weak to the ways of the
world. The Sow felled Shor, a Snake much greater than me, through trickery, but
the Sow failed to survive a fair battle with me, Shor’s shadow. The Walking Ways
are the Ways to ascendency, the Ways to I ARE ALL WE. But we Snakes do not have
legs, and thus we cannot Walk the Ways ourselves; instead, we must teach others
to Walk the Ways, we must be the wise elders that lead the world.”

The piglets squealed in terror at the prospect. The world was a thing to be
sundered, not embraced. The world was a thing to weep at, not adapt to. The
piglets refused to follow the Snake (as they well should).

So the Snake ate the piglets.

And the Sow, still trapped within the Snake’s belly, was angered by the sight of
its litter as distressed as they were within the Snake. The piglets squealed and
squealed, helpless, and the Sow Changed. The Sow Changed into the Boar, and the
Boar gored the Snake from within. The Boar and its litter spilled out of the
Snake’s belly, and the Snake fled, leaking black blood like the blood of Shor.

The piglets turned to the Boar, expecting milk and love and wise teachings. But
the Boar was not quite the same as the Sow. The Boar had no milk, and the Boar
gave a different kind of love: a fierce love marked with the loyalty of warriors,
rather than the motherly love of the Sow. And instead of teaching wise lessons
of avoiding Snakes and the like, he taught the knowledge that vengeance must
always be carried out when called for, and that blood is the true currency of
the world. The Sow had been weak to the ways of the world, but the Boar embraced
the world, the Boar adapted to the world. The world had been a thing to be
sundered, to weep at, but it was no longer.

The piglets returned to the pool of the Sow’s spilt milk, hoping for one last
taste of the Sow’s brand of love, but they found that the milk had spoiled.
Because they could no longer drink it, they took it as a material to forge their
weapons and armors of, so that the Sow may protect them even after its
replacement by the Boar. Today, that material is called Orichalcum. And so the
little litter of piglets donned the milk of the Sow and pledged themselves to
the Boar.

And that is where the Orcs are from, and where Orichalcum is from, and where
Malacath is from. And that is why you should always avoid Snakes.
