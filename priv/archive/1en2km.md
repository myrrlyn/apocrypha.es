  This is a piece that I started forever ago, and has been languishing
  half-completed in my lore folder for quite a while now. I’ve finally gotten my
  backside in gear and finished it up, so enjoy, Bosmer fans.

{:.foreword}

Pelin-El came to the edge of Cyrod where the trees ceased to weep and began to
sing, and where the Boiche kept forever-watch from the mighty trees. The white
stone of the Ayleidoon would not cross that edge of Cyrod and beyond it all was
unspoiled, dark and green. The graht-oaks walked and the beasts roared and the
Boiche roamed indolent in the spring.

Those Ayleid who were wise fled where their stone did not go and vanished among
the trees where their beads were like berries and their feathers were like
leaves and where their brothers took them to hide. Their escape was an insult
and Pelin-El demanded their elf-blood. The star-made-knight was bathed in the
blood of elf-kings who fought him, and so he had no fear of Y’ffre’s forest. He
called out the king that was in those elf-lands, for at that time there was only
one and the green-sap was true-whole.

The One King of the Elves in the South, and always-king of Y’ffre’s people, was
Eplear, whose helm was the skull of Great-Gold-Ape-King (whose bones were golden
moonstone), and whose bow was the long wing of the Great-Roc-of-the-Hunt (whose
shadow made the Boiche forget Magnus sometimes), and whose home was
Green-Sap-Walking (whose blood was the blood of the forest). And Eplear King
heard the call of Pelinal.

Eplear knew the seven-hundred benefits of hiding (and the three-hundred more
that were his gift to all Bosmer), but he did not hide, for he knew not to this
time. And Eplear knew the many ways of the hunt, that are the treasure of all
his people (and were his great mastery), but he did not hunt Pelin-El, for he
knew not to this time. And Eplear knew Payment-in-Kind, which Z’en taught to
Y’ffre (who taught it to his favourite children) and Z’en’s mirror-children
reminded to the Boiche, and so to Eplear, so he knew that Pelin-El should be
paid-in-kind with cutting swords and tears, but he did not cut or tear Pelin-El,
for he knew not to this time.

Instead, Eplear Elf-King went also to the edge of Cyrod, where stood the bloody
diamond. His arrows were fast and strong, but he loosed none. Instead he loosed
his mighty voice that won Valenwood.

“Pelin-El, star-made-knight, butcher of my kin, bloodier of trees, many-shape
(?) of Cyrod. Our strength is great and our forest is blessed. Your bloody hands
have no hold on the green-sap.”

The man-beast was not to be deterred, for men know not how to flee.

But Eplear did not come out to die like those Ayleid kings. His lips parted and
he roared mightily into Cyrod and Pelinal heard the wind in the trees and the
crash of the sea and the splashing of rain and the roar of all the beasts. And
the star-made-knight lowered his sword and turned his back on Eplear Elf-King
and his forest, and never again turned his blade to that edge where the trees
began to sing. Even in his Madness, Pelinal would not forget the Voice of
Eplear, for Pelinal was sometimes mad but always Ada.
