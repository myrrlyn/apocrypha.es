  So the other day I posted [this][0], and had some fun with it. I had some
  inspiration so I knocked out this related piece in remarkably littler time
  (given the time it took to finish Eplear and Pelinal). It doesn’t really
  address any established historical point, or touch on many sources at all, it
  was just fun so make of it what you will.

{:.foreword}

After many years of the hunt-against-wise-foes Eplear of the Camorans was
supreme among the Boiche. Every tribe and clan had promised itself to Eplear and
the green-sap by Eplear’s words or his thousand arrows and blades, and Eplear
had welcomed them. All the Boiche were as one and the green-sap was true-whole.
The forest rejoiced to know Y’ffre’s touch, and Falinesti graht-oak sang as
Eplear climbed to its highest branch.

There he stood, mightiest among Boiche and root of the sap. Atop
Green-Sap-Walking Eplear king-of-all saw all his forest and praised Y’ffre that
it was good. He promised all things good to Y’ffre who gave all things good to
Bosmer. Y’ffre smiled on Eplear, most favoured among most favoured green-sap,
and Falinesti graht-oak, most favoured among most favoured green-sap also, rose
to walk Eplear king-of-all through the forest. A thousand thousand Boiche
followed in the great graht-oak’s wake and the Valenwood sang to see them run
through it, as sap through a tree.

Great Falinesti came to rest at last, as if in summer (for it was
summer-of-the-heart for all green-sap). And a thousand thousand Boiche climbed
its branches to crown their king-of-all, Eplear Elf-King Camoran.

The greatest graht-oak stretched and sang and grew a new shape, only for Eplear
Elf-King, a throne of the green-sap, living wood vibrant in honour of the
king-of-all. Eplear sat and his people bowed. Every tribe of the Boiche came to
lay gifts before Eplear Camoran, gifts for all the Bosmer.

Abragoth of the Kahnik gave the head of Great-Gold-Ape-King, war chief of the
golden apes who would not promise to Eplear (but not of those who would), and
who the Kahnik shot with many arrows for their king-of-all. His bones were
golden moonstone, and Eplear ate his face that his skull would be a helm for a
king.

Wendilac of the Parikh gave a hundred hundred pearls from the Blue Divide,
treasures of Y’ffre’s eyes-in-the-water, now Eplear’s eyes-in-the-woods.

Boleron of the Andrulo gave the hide of a terrible time-lizard, that the great
hunter had chased over every footprint.

Hormilrimor of the Guleld gave a feather, which was very beautiful.

Ungalithor of the Liilgur Matilion gave himself to guard the king-of-all with
every day, even when joy led him elsewhere.

Silvenar of the Edinil gave his everything-that-is to Eplear to give to all the
Boiche to speak.

Oolathar of the Oolathar gave a million arrows of every make for Eplear to shoot
a million things.

Kidragon of the Tithihk gave all the colours, every one that is, on his own
body.

Yuuligon of the Calobar gave a great dead bug.

Fogorth of the Jalkin gave a hundred vessels of honey that was sweet and good
and fit for the king-of-all.

And many other tribes gave many other gifts, and Eplear had many hundreds. And
when all the tribes had given all the gifts, others came as well.

The giants gave Eplear a city of Haven. They walked in the sea and made great
buildings of stone they fetched, only tiny buildings to them because giants are
great-large.

The bird-men of the rivers gave Eplear five-and-twenty tongues of their own, and
after he ate them all he spoke them all and sang.

The satyrs of the woods gave a secret, whispered one more benefit of hiding even
Eplear had not thought of.  Eplear told everyone the secret because he did not
like them, but everyone liked the satyrs’ benefit of hiding.

The centaurs gave Eplear an idea that many things would happen and one day men
would rule.

Kulathuah the Keptu gave much tree-flesh that Eplear knew was useful to the
clever men.

Juuk the Kothri gave ten strange beasts from far away.

Hadhuul the king of elves-elsewhere gave a handful of magic, which his people
were clever at.

And many other peoples gave many other gifts, and at the end of it all Eplear
had many many hundreds. And he gave them all to all his people, because the
green-sap was true-whole and Eplear wanted only that. He called to the priests
of Y’ffre, who were all wise and holy Boiche who knew many things, and knew what
Y’ffre wanted almost as well as Eplear Camoran. They climbed to the highest
branches with Eplear and placed the golden skull of the Great-Gold-Ape-King on
his head and called him king with a song. All the Boiche sang and the forest
sang with them, and Jone and Jode smiled to hear such a beautiful song of the
green-sap, and listened as they sang for a whole turn.

When the song was done, Eplear took his bow, and one of his million arrows, and
loosed it so far and so fast and so strongly that the bow shattered into dust,
and the arrow flew higher than Jone and Jode. Eplear never missed, and when some
time was passed, the sky grew darker, and the Great-Roc-of-the-Hunt fell from
the sky to land at the feet of Green-Sap-Walking. Eplear Camoran ate its great
elf heart, and much more besides, and tore one great wing from its body. He ate
that too, until only a great long bone was left, and that was his new bow, fit
for king-of-all. And then Eplear declared that all were his clan, and all the
Boiche feasted on the Great-Roc-of-the-Hunt until they were full.

After many hours of feasting, and many hours of singing, and many hours of
dancing, and many hours of lovemaking, Eplear was king-of-all in Valenwood,
Elf-King Camoran beloved by all and all knew. Eplear told the Boiche that Y’ffre
smiled on all of them, and Eplear knew no falsehood, and he was right.
