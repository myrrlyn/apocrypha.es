  I am in not an expert on lore, and not very familiar with the exact origin
  myths of Mundus (I find those mostly confusing). So if there are any
  inconsistencies, please state so in the comments so I may edit it.
  Furthermore, if people like it, I will create more volumes.

Hello, and thank you for purchasing the first volume of “On the Species of
Tamriel”! During this multi-part set of analisations of the various traits and
characteristics of the various species of our beautiful continent (which, at
time of writing (20th of Sun’s Height, 4E3) is on discount at First Edition in
the Imperial City), I will take you on journey throughout Tamriel, helping you
understand the species inhabiting her.

Before analyzing the exact heritage of each and any intelligent species of
Tamriel, both extant and extinct (where enough information is available), it is
important to understand the common root they all share (notable exceptions being
the Hists and the Argonians of Black Marsh). And to even begin understanding the
common root, we need to take a look at the creation of Nirn and Mundus itself.

According to the legends, Lorkhan envisioned Mundus when looking at the wheel of
Aurbis. After convincing some of the et’Ada to help him create it, they
positioned Mundus at the center of said wheel. However, as we all know, Lorkhan
was at this point already known as a trickster, and the other et’Ada quickly
lost faith in him. Most of them abondened Mundus, but not all.

These that remained, known as the Ehlnofey, gave up most of their “godly” power
to stabilize Mundus. Some of them became the earth bones, laws of nature, used
to stabilize the physics of Mundus, yet others settled the newly created world
of Nirn as mortals, along with the Hist. As in almost all civilisations, not all
of them agreed, and those left the homeland of the Ehlnofey, becoming known as
the wanderers.

Eventually, the friction between the Wanderers and the old Ehlnofey sparked a
full-out war. The exact details of the war are unknown, and we will probably
never know the exact form of it. However the results are known to be huge
destruction throughout Nirn, shaping most, if not all, of its continents and
oceans. The Hist, interestingly, remained neutral in this conflict (as is their
nature). Alongside the reshaping of Nirn, the war also finalised the split
between the Old Ehlnofey and the Wanderers. According to the myths, the Old
Ehlnofey remained on their homeland of (the possible fictional) Aldmeris,
becoming the ancestors of the mer (or the elves, as they are more commonly
referred to in Cyrodiil), while the wanderers roamed throughout Tamriel, and
later settling the other continents, to become the ancestors of men.
