The Altmer (meaning “old” or “high/noble people” in their own tongue), or High
Elves, as they are primarily known outside of the elven provinces (in this case,
“high” doesn’t necessarily denote noble or civilized, and is mostly used to
refer to the arrogant and snobby attitude that some of them express towards the
other races of Tamriel), are a tall and gold-skinned race of elves from the
Summerset Isles. They are considered to be the most like the common elven
ancestor, the Aldmer (see volume II for notes on this). They are well known for
their incredible expertise with magic and their art, sometimes regarded as the
height of culture.

The Altmer are easily distinguishable, even for the untrained eye, as they are
easily the tallest people in Tamriel, surpassing even the Nords of Skyrim,
towering over the other races, and having a yellow/golden skin colour. Along
these remarkable traits, they also share the more common elven traits, namely
pointed ears, a slender build, a respectable longevity, and a very strong
affinity towards magicka. This affinity is, however, so strong, that they not
only are better spell casters and mages, but are also more vulnerable to it. An
other interesting characteristic is that, even though they keep their gene pool
small on purpose (to appear more like their ancestors), they still have a
heightened resistance to most diseases.

Historically, the Altmer have long resented the Empire, as they see the other
races as inferior, and find themselves isolated of the matters of the mainland
on their own islands. Even though they did not take part in most of the early
conflicts and problems of Tamriel, they weren’t completely untroubled. Indeed,
the Altmer have more than one time saved Tamriel from invasions (not out of care
for the other species, but out of the fact that they were the first target),
like the Sloads and the Maormer, along with some internal conflicts. During
these wars, the Altmer grew tired of the attacks, and formed an alliance with
the Bosmer of Valenwood, called the Aldmeri Dominion. This helped defend the
Summerset Isles, but could not stand against the armies of Tiber Septim. In 2E
896, the Summerset Isles were incorporated into the Empire, after the Numidium
was used to crush the Altmeri armies. They remained part of the Empire until 4E
29, when, some years after taking power of the Summerset Isles and renaming it
Alinor (after the capital), the Thalmor, a political, Altmeri supremacist,
group, seized control of Valenwood, severed all ties with the Empire, and
renamed the two united provinces to “The Aldmeri Dominion”, after the historical
union. During the next 150 years, the Aldmeri Dominion accepts the remains of
Elsweyr, and invades Cyrodiil and Hammerfell, which leads to the sacking of the
Imperial City and the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, further sundering the
already waning power of the Empire. After the Concordat, the Thalmor could be
found throughout the remains of the Empire, fortifying their power and trying to
destroy any form of Talos worship.

The Altmer culture is noted for its focus on Magicka and art. Like mentioned
beforehand, their art is regarded at the height of culture, and they are known
to even ornate their armour and weapons (mostly with avian themes).Alongside the
strong artistic traditions, they are known as some of the best mages and
magickal researchers on Tamriel. Indeed, some of the most well known magickal
organisation find their origin on the Summerset Isles, including the Psijic
order and the Mages Guild. Alongside this, some of the Archmages of the Mages
Guild and Imperial Battlemages were Altmer, most notably Ocato of Firsthold,
Battlemage, trusted advisor of Uriel Septim VII, High Chancellor of the Elder
Council and Potentate of the Empire.

Despite their supposed selective breeding, Altmer are known to carefully pick
their partners, and it is common for couples to spend as much time together as
possible.

Their culture is also known as being very structured and hierarchical, and it
has occurred more than once that the higher casts decided on personal aspects of
the lower castes’ lives. A notable example is the institution of the Altmeri
pantheon, which replaced some Aedra with ones seen as “higher” by the nobles,
and their supposed selective breeding. This focus on Altmeri supremacy, in
recent years advocated by the Thalmor, has met with resentment by the younger
generations of Altmer, who express the desire of more peaceful relations with
the other parts of Tamriel. Even though this new movement exists, most people of
Tamriel are still more familiar with the Thalmor and their predecessors, and as
such still regard the Altmer as being arrogant.Their pantheon is vast, and
includes the eight divines also worshipped by the Imperials, alongside other
et’Ada, mostly related to magic (i.e. Magnus, Syrabane). Because of their et’Ada
heritage, they deeply hate Lorkhan, who they take responsible for making them
mortal, along with any men-made additions to the different religions, most
notably the Cyro-Nordic god-hero Talos (it is rumoured that the ban on the
Talos-worship by the Thalmor is to further destroy the Towers, which would
result in the collapse of Mundus and ending the Kalpa, in the hope of regaining
their divinity).
