The Bosmer, in the Elven language meaning “wood people” (or as they call
themselves: Boiche, “tree-sap people”, as their name in their own tongue means),
in Cyrodiil better known as the Woodelves, are a race of mer from the forested
province of Valenwood, on the southern shore of Tamriel. They are a curious
people, regarded as some of the best archers around, albeit lazy ones.

The biology of the Woodelves is significantly different from that of other
Elves. Even though they share the affinity for magic, the pointed ears and the
longevity of the other merkinds, they are stouter than their more elegant
brethren. This is most apparent in the male Bosmer, which is shorter than the
female and the rest of the Tamrielic species (not counting the Alfiq Khajiit
subspecies). This short and somewhat plump build helps them greatly in
navigating the dense forests of their homeland. Because of their lifestyle
(which in some circles is described as rudimentary), they have developed a
resistance to most diseases. Alongside this, they have the ability to control
more simple minded creatures, of which there is plenty in Valenwood. Lastly the
elves of Valenwood hold a darker power of which they don’t like talking, called
“the Wild Hunt”, which will be explained later.

There are some sources on the origin of the Bosmer. The Altmer hold that, most
likely because of their very open and tolerant culture, the Elves took “mannish
wives”. It is highly plausible that the early Aldmeri settlers had human wives,
which would explain their shorter and compacter build. However, the Bosmer
themselves hold a different theory, which might not be as farfetched as it seems
at first sight.

The Bosmer believe they descend from Aldmer who were blessed with something
called “the Green Pact”. This pact, made with Y’ffre (in some accounts a
collective name for the Earth Bones, in others one of the Earth Bones), made the
Bosmer the keepers of the forest, and shaped them to better suit the wood life.
According to this pact, the Bosmer are not aloud to harm any form of flora, and
as such are required to feed and build solely with animal materials (they have
been lenient with this rule, as imported wood and other plant material is
allowed). A disturbing side affect of this, is that Bosmer are obliged to eat
their fallen foes, both animal and sentient, including other Bosmer. In case of
a sentient death, only the family of the slayer is allowed to help (the
definition of family might be broader in Bosmeri culture. It might denote
everything from immediate family to the entire species). It is important to note
that the Green Pact is only in effect in Valenwood; Bosmer are allowed to cut
trees outside of Valenwood, and they use imported materials for their housing.

The Bosmeri culture is noted for being one of the most tolerant (although this
has waned in the wake of the reestablishment of the Aldmeri Dominion). Bosmer
readily except other races, from inside and outside of Valenwood, outcast or
king. It is plausible this tolerance and openness led to interbreeding between
mer and men, possibly resulting in the Bosmer appearance (that is, if the Y’ffre
theory appears to be false). This also made them the target of despise by their
Altmeri cousins, who view men as evil. This tolerance has also led to some of
the more interesting pantheons on Tamriel. Alongside some of the more typical
Aldmeri deities, the Bosmer also venerate the Cyrodillian god Arkay, the
Kothringi god Z’en, an aspect of the god Zenithar, whose power is now toil and
payment in kind, and Herma-Mora takes the same role he has in Nordic religion.
They also venerate some gods, like the Moon Gods, like the Khajiit do, their
ancient rivals. Alongside these gods of mixed heritage, they have one god that
is unique to their pantheon, namely Y’ffre. Alongside his role as maker of the
Green Pact (as noted above), he was also the god that, in the days of the Dawn
Era, taught the creatures their final form. Before this point (before time
flowed linearly), the creatures took every form, possible and impossible, all at
the same time. After fixing all shapes and forms, he gave the Bosmer the
knowledge of their old form, and the ritual required to regain it. Bosmer taking
this form is called the “Wild Hunt”. The Woodelves performing this ritual will
transform in dark beasts, blinded by fury, and will devour their enemies.
Because it is a final transformation, the hunters will devour each other until
one remains, who will flee into the wild. Bosmer don’t like talking about it,
and only resort to it as an act of desperation. Because of the knowledge Y’ffre
gave the Bosmer, he is often referred to as “the Storyteller”. Because of this
title and the respect the Bosmer hold for this god, they are fabled bards and
poets. This and their often upbeat nature make them a popular sight at festivals.

Bosmer society divides the Bosmer in multiple clans and families. The clans have
almost never been united, and often the pride of unity vanishes after a few
years. Because of these small communities, the Bosmer know little solidarity. In
the rest of the continent they are seen as lazy, since some of them rarely to
anything productive. Alongside this, Bosmeri troops are infamous for low
discipline and deserting at the littlest sign of threat. Even though these
traits are common in Valenwood, outside of their home province, they seem to
easily adapt. It is not uncommon to meet them around Tamriel as traders,
shopkeepers and fletchers.

The Bosmer are noteworthy archers. their fletch work is famous around Tamriel
for being the best there is; their skills are so well known, it is even rumoured
that fletching originated in Valenwood. Since the Green Pact prohibits Wood
Elves using any wood, most bows are made of chitin or bone.

Bosmeri culture dates back to the very start of the first era, when the
legendary king Eplear united his kin. During the first era, the Bosmer had
numerous skirmishes with the upcoming Alessian empire. These were quickly ended
with a Wild Hunt, killing then emperor Borgas. The empire divided the Bosmer
after this by giving all city states independence. This broke up the unity they
had, which resulted in a last resort treaty with the Altmer of the Summerset
Isles to create the Aldmeri Dominion. Hundreds of years later, Valenwood was,
like all other provinces, annexed by the empire, of which it remained part until
the Thalmor seized it. The institution of Thalmor rule saw the decline of the
openness so striking for Bosmeri culture.
