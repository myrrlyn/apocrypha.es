An alchemist is not like other practicers of magic. All magic users are forced
to probe the nature of reality to gain power, but most of these methods are
fundamentally involve illicit deals with powerful demons from Oblivion. Some
scholars have argued that destruction magic is applied Alteration, but I would
argue that Mehrunes Dagon is at the root of sorcerous abilities. Conjuration and
it's bastard cousin Necromancy aren't even subtle about hiding their connections
to the foul planes of blasphemy which creep incessantly into our world, probing
at the borders. Alchemy is the only form of magic which is completely removed
from all Daedric studies.

When the Dwemer disappeared from the Mundus, they left behind only their ruins
and a few scraps of untranslatable text with drawings. However, based on ancient
stories about them that have been preserved by the other races, we know that
they were fearsome warriors and parsimonious traders, who were masters in the
arts of blacksmithing and alchemy. We know they spat on the religion of the
“lower” races, although it must be remembered they lived in a time when Daedra
and Dragon worship was the most common form of religion around them, even before
the Chimer exiles invaded and built Houses. I think the three virtues of
blacksmithing, alchemy, and tonal architecture (the magic of song) was the
original ALMSIVI. When the Dwemer died, their religion was much too powerful to
die with them. It invaded the nearest host, the Chimer, and changed their
religion forever. It gave them some of the power of the vanished race, and it
also infected them with the same weaknesses. The Nerevarine Prophecy was the
only thing that prevented the Sixth House from marching on Tamriel with
Akulakhan and the Corprus at their backs. To remove the infection,
Nerevar-incarnate also had to remove the artificial strengths of his people.
