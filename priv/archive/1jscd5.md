Each of the Anticipations has contradictory values. Mephala encourages subtlety
and honesty, and Azura offers the power of magic and the un-power of destiny.
Boethiah’s two faces are Cruelty and Mercy. He represents both the agony of a
snake’s poison and the remedial benefits of alchemical salves and concoctions.
Poison which causes painless death is another kind of mercy.

The Face Snaked Queen Ayem takes this contradiction and paradox and straddles
it. The reason each of the Tribunes command such incredible amounts of power is
because they’re not just mantling one et’Ada, but two. The other was a Dwemer
spirit figure, forgotten now to all but Almalexia herself, who was responsible
for teaching the Deep Elves how to make medicine and poison.

When the heart connection stopped, she did not become insane. Death and poison
was a part of her from the beginning. She murdered her brother and plotted
against her husband, who had betrayed her for her half-brother. Kill or be
killed; swift death is a kindness.
