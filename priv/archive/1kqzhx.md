  Here is my Commentary on Volume II of The Mythic Dawn Commentaries by Mankar
  Camoran

  Enjoy!

> *“Answers are liberations, where the slaves of Malbioge that came to know*
> *Numantia cast down their jailer king, Maztiak, which the Xarxes Mysterium*
> *calls the Arkayn. Maztiak, whose carcass was dragged through the streets by*
> *his own bone-walkers and whose flesh was opened on rocks thereon and those*
> *angels who loved him no longer did drink from his honeyed ichors screaming*
> *"Let all know free will and do as they will!”*

Volume 2 starts off with a bang here. We have some names and words here that,
despite my best efforts, I’m afraid I have come up short on definitions.

First we will start with ‘Malbioge’. After some hunting I found some references
to Malebolge, the 8th circle of Hell from Dante’s Inferno. Here there are ten
pits or trenches for sinners to be punished. This can relate to the idea of
Mundus and Mortality being a prison to be escaped from rather than a gate to
transcendence.

“Maztiak” is another name that I cannot find much on. But, we see “Arkayn” in
reference to Maztiak. Could this be a relation to Arkay and the cycle of Life
and Death? Absolutely, especially when considering the Malebolge connection in
Dante’s Inferno as well as the idea of Numantia and eternal service to Dagon.

Another connection that might be made is Lorkhan. Perhaps Maztiak is a mortal
name of Lorkhan in a previous Kalpa; this would fit as Lorkhan conceptualized
the idea of Mundus and mortality, thus could be considered the “jailer-king” and
those that drank in his ichors screamed Padhomeic ideology. Personally, I like
the Arkay connection more; but I believe this has merit on it’s own as well.

*"Let all know free will and do as they will!"* - Nice little bit of Crowley
stuff thrown in at the end. Nothing crazy to add to this, but I love finding
Crowley references in TES.

> *“Your coming was foretold, my brother, by the Lord Dagon in his book of*
> *razors. You are to come as Idols drop away from you one by one. You are*
> *exalted in eyes that have not yet set on you; you, swain to well-travelled*
> *to shatterer of mantles. You, brother, are to sit with me in Paradise and be*
> *released of all unknowns. Indeed, I shall show you His book and its*
> *foul-and-many-feathered rubric so that you can put into symbols what you*
> *already know: the sphere of destruction is but the milk of the unenslaved. I*
> *fault not your stumbling, for they are expected and given grace by the Oils.*
> *I crave not your downfalls, though without them you might surpass me even in*
> *the coming Earth of all infinities. Lord Dagon wishes you no ills but the*
> *momentous. And as He wants, you must want, and so learn from the pages of*
> *God this: the Ritual of Want:”*

This Volume just doesn’t get any easier. Mankar implies that the initiate will
lose faith in the false gods of Mundus. He further implies that the initiate (or
the order itself) is destined to break the stranglehold these idols have on the
Mundus and it’s inhabitants.

> *“the sphere of destruction is but the milk of the unenslaved.”*

Here Mankar further perverts the definition of Padhomeia (yes I made this word
up) from simple change or chaos to Dagon’s own sphere of destruction, thus
implying that the extreme side of change (destruction) is the only path to
transcendence.

> *“Whisper to earth and earth, where the meddlers take no stones except to*
> *blood, as blood IS blood, and to the cracking of bone, as bone IS bone, and*
> *so to crack and answer and fall before the one and one, I call you Dragon as*
> *brother and king.”*

Now this is interesting. We see almost the exact same passage in Vivec’s
dialogue during his trial:

> “As lord of the middle air I bless these proceedings to **earth and earth,**
> **where the meddlers take no stones except to blood, as blood IS blood, and**
> **to the cracking of bone, as bone IS bone, and so to crack and answer and**
> **fall before the one and one, I call you Dragon as brother and king**,
> flame-faced, turgid, accounted, crowned in hours, see this as wanted and so to
> write, set letter, set in time, and I call you Wife, sister and queen, hole
> and throne, wet, spending, moan’ed before marriage, see this as wanted and so
> to wed, led-to-loved, set in never, GO DOWN AE ALTADOON DEN, for trailed it is
> in slime we make our babes and the walker heeds no mock of dirt, until you,
> until you, there, I call you there, I call you Proud One, brother-by-death,

> RKHET the Taker now took, for this is wanted, set your seven swords, sensible

> for them with string, grim engine JHNAL AE THE EARTH AM, through Eight I bless
> it EARTH AM AS EARTH AM”

I honestly have no idea what to say about this. Rather than ignore it, I figured
I would include this since I noticed the cross-over between Mankar and Vivec. If
anybody has any insight on this, I would greatly appreciate the information on
this as well as the rest of the ritual.

> *“Enraptured, he who finally goes unrecorded.*
>
> *Recorded, the slaves that without knowing turn the Wheel.*
>
> *Enslaved, all the children of the Aurbis As It Is.”*

Let’s look at this in reverse.

- Mortals born in Mundus are inherently bound to their mortal ‘prison’, living
  their lives according to the status quo.
- They are recorded, bound to the medium they are recorded upon: Linear history,
  bound to the hub of the Wheel.
- Enraptured, or filled with delight are those that finally go unrecorded; or
  those that break free from the Mundus and join Mankar in his Paradise.

All in all, this Volume is quite complicated and esoteric. It’s very difficult
to decipher in a meaningful way. For this reason, I have decided to continue
writing a “Part” for each Volume as well as a fifth “Part” to tie them all
together. As always, I would appreciate thoughts, corrections, conversation and
ranting in all shapes and forms.
