The Imperials (also known under the archaic name “Cyrods”) are the race of men
from Cyrodiil. Living in the biggest and most urbanised province on Tamriel, as
well as being the ruling force on the continent for a very long time, the
Imperials are the most populous race around, being the most numerous in their
own province of Cyrodiil, as well as prominently visible in the other provinces.

Biologically, the Imperials are almost indistinguishable from the Bretons of
High Rock, partially because of their shared Nedic heritage. More prominent
differences are the average magickal capabilities of the Imperials, as well as
being more skilled melee fighters than the Bretons. While traditionally the
Nedes were darker skinned and haired than their northern brethren, this has
somewhat waned in more recent times, because of much Cyro-Nordic interbreeding.

The Imperial originate from the Nedes, the only race descendent of the Wanderers
to stay on Tamriel, in what might be the best documented history on Tamriel.
These Nedes had long been ruled over by the Ayleids, or the Wild Elves. The
Nedes of Cyrodiil did not experience the same amount of interbreeding with Elves
(if any) as the Bretons did, which accounts for them being regarded as different
races. At what point the Nedes were seen as Imperials for the first time is
unknown, only that it was after the Slave Rebellion of 1E 242.

Imperial culture is very tolerant to outsiders (partially because of their
centralised geographic position, as well as the role of the Imperial City). As a
result, their culture has been heavily influenced by that of the other races,
and influences those as well. Cyrodiil is the most populous province on Tamriel,
and, as a result, is heavily urbanised. Because of this, as well as their
important political role, many Imperials are traders and politicians. Because of
their long history with politics and trading, Imperials have developed a
affinity to public speaking and charming, skills invaluable on the big political
scene of Tamriel. The Imperials are one of the most technologically advanced
races on the continent, as they are capable of building and maintaining a large
enough infrastructure to support many big cities, most notably the Imperial
City, the biggest city on Tamriel. Not only is this supported by technology, but
also by force. The Imperial Legion, for long the most dominant military force on
Tamriel, patrols the many roads, as well as guarding the Imperial City itself.
Just as Cyrodiil itself, the Legion is not only composed of Imperials, but draws
me and women from the entirety of the Empire. The sheer amount of numbers are
backed by expert strategists, hardened by the long history of violence the
Imperials have. The religion of the Imperials was based around the eight
divines, and later the nine divines (sometimes called “the Eight and One”),
which comprises of the Aedra Akatosh, Arkay, Dibella, Julianos, Kynareth, Mara,
Stendar, and Zenithar, as well as the later addition of the hero-god Talos, who,
during most of his mortal life, was known as Tiber Septim. The original pantheon
was adopted by the early Nedes, based of the Aldmeri and Nordic pantheons, and
heavily reorganised by the Alessian Order in the years following the Slave
Rebellion. After the death of Tiber Septim, the founder of the third Empire, he
was incorporated as the ninth divine, and the only non-Aedra in the Cyrodiilic
pantheon. While strictly not illegal, Daedra worship is strongly looked down
upon in Cyrodiilic culture, disregarding what Daedra is being worshipped. This
itself can be seen as strange, as the Imperials have a history of cults.

The history of the Imperials is one of the best documented ones in Tamrielic
history. Descending from the Nedes, the proto-Cyrods have long been the slaves
of their Elven masters, the Ayleids. This changed during the Slave Rebellion,
sometime in the first Era, when the Nedes, led by Saint Alessia, as well as
other mythic (and sometime divine) heroes. The Humans of Cyrodiil staged an
uprising and fought themselves free of the Elves, climaxing at the siege of the
Imperial City, when the Shezzarine Pelinal Whitestrake single-handedly stormed
the White-Gold Tower, and killed Umaril the Unfeathered, an Ayleid
sorcerer-king, aligned with the Daedric prince Meridia. Afterwards, the Ayleid
kings attacked Pelinal, and severed his body into eight pieces. This was the
start of the First Empire, or the Alessian Empire. It was a time of relative
piece and prosperity, until the Empire collapsed due to conflict within the
Alessian Order, a religious and hugely influential cult. Cyrodiil was split into
multiple kingdoms, all ruled by local warlords. While there were multiple of
these kingdoms, the most dominant ones were those of Colovia, in Western
Cyrodiil, and those of the Niben, in the East. Even to this day there are
cultural differences between the areas. Cyrodiil was again unified under Reman
Cyrodiil, a mythical hero-king at the end of the First Era. Cyrodiil was under
attack by the Akaviri, and to combat them, he united Colovia and the Niben. He
was successful, and started his own dynasty, as well as the Second Empire. The
second Empire was different from the others, as the Tsaeci of Akavir had a huge
amount of influence of the Empire. So much in fact, that after the assasination
of the last Reman, Reman III, the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, proclaimed himself
as sole ruler (while not using the title 'Emperor’). The Akaviri Potentate
ended in 2E 430, when the last descendent of Versidue-Shaie, Savirien-Chorak,
was assassinated. This created another power vacuum, and saw the reestablishment
of the many warlord led kingdoms. Tamriel was yet again united at the end of the
Second Era, this time by Talos, or, as he was known after his coronation, Tiber
Septim. Since there are conflicting theories regarding his history, I while keep
with the official one. He was born on Atmora, under the name Talos (meaning
Stormcrown in Old Ehlnofex). He grew up in Skyrim, were he was soon discovered
as a expert ruler and tactician. In Skyrim, he also learned the ancient art of
the Voice, and was eventually called by the Greybeards of High Hrothgar. They
told him that he was prophesised to be the ruler of Tamriel, but he had to go
south for that. In Cyrodiil, he became general under Cuhlecain, the king of
Colovia. Before they could install Cuhlecain as Emperor, Talos had to defend
Cyrodiil from the combined armies of High Rock and Skyrim. The Nords quickly
joined his side after his use of the Thu’um (which he, being Dragonborn, was
expertly skilled in). High Rock retreated, but was able to assassinate now
emperor Cuhlecain (it is rumoured that Talos himself might have done this, but
sources are hard to find for obvious reasons). Talos quickly used this
opportunity to install himself as emperor, taking the Cyrodiilic name Tiber
Septim. He went on to conquer the rest of Tamriel, and his heirs (known as
either the Septim dynasty, or the Dragonborn emperors) ruled Tamriel for the
entirety of the Third Era, in what would be called the Third or Septim Empire.
The Septim Empire saw huge prosperity and stability throughout Tamriel, but this
changed at the end of the Third Era, starting with the Imperial Simulacrum, and
ending with the Oblivion Crisis. During the Crisis, the last emperor, Uriel
Septim VII was assassinated, along with all his heirs. The only heir left was
his illegitimate son Martin, who, with the help of the Champion of Cyrodiil,
changed in an avatar of Akatosh, to stop Mehrunes Dagon’s invasion. This saw the
end of the Septim bloodline, and even though then High Chancellor and later
potentate Ocato of Firsthold tried to keep the empire together, the Empire
collapsed, and would never become more than a shade of its former glory, also
because of the explosive grow of the Aldmeri Dominion. With the assassination of
Ocato and the weak power the Medes, the new Imperial dynasty of the Empire, had,
along with the growing power of the Thalmor, Tamriel was once again at war.
During the Great War, the Imperial City was sacked, and the Empire became
nothing more than a vassal state of the Thalmor. Along with the power the
Thalmor held over the Empire, the worship of Talos was proclaimed illegal, since
the Thalmor don’t recognise his divine position. This angered the Imperials, but
especially the Nords, which caused increased tensions between the Empire and
Skyrim.
