## Kothringi

The Kothringi were a race of men now gone. They inhabited the swamps of Black
Marsh, and, while not known to have had major conflicts with the Argonians, were
probably destroyed by the Hist. Not much is known about their appearance, except
that they had silver skin. This in itself is strange, as they most likely
descended from the same group of Wanderers as the Nedes did, who have a warmer
skin colour. The Kothringi were divided into four major tribes: Orma, Yerpest,
Horwalli, and Kothringi (or Kothringi proper, to avoid confusion with the race
itself). How these tribes were divided is unknown. The Kothringi had their own
pantheon, of which only Mara and Z’en (a different aspect of Zenithar) are
known. Kothringi culture is little known to us, but we do know that the
Kothringi preferred going about naked, even though many of them decided to do
wear clothes when in more civilised circles. Along with this, we know that the
Kothringi were experienced sailors, and that at least a few of them made it into
the Imperial Legion as knight during the Second Era. The exact origin of the
Kothringi is unknown, besides that they shared the continent with many more
different tribes of men (including the Nedes). They inhabited Black Marsh and
lived, just like the Argonians and Lilmothiit, in tribes. Not much is known
about their history, except that it suddenly ended during the Knahaten Flu (2E
560-2E 603), which saw the death of almost all sentient live in Black Marsh,
with the exception of the Argonians and Hist. The fact that those two races did
survive, along with the Thrassian Plague being made by sentient live, has
sparked the assumption that the Hist and Argonians were behind the Flu. This
however, is still up to debate. While all Kothringi died in the end, one ship
full of sick Kothringi set sail during the Flu, seeking shelter. They were
turned down at every port, including the many ports of Hammerfell. The
Kothringi, now desperate for refuge, decided to set sail to the west, never to
be seen again. This came to be known as the Day of Shame in Hammerfell, and even
to this day, the Redgaurds in Hammerfell do not leave their houses on the 20^th^
of Rains Hand, out of guilt.

## Lilmothiit

The Lilmothiit were a race of fox-like creatures from Black Marsh. There is
little to no information available about this race. As such, they are most
likely the most obscure group of sentient life on Tamriel. The knowledge we have
about their appearance doesn’t go further than that they were vulpine. In how
much they resembled foxes is unknown. Like with everything of the Lilmothiit,
there origin is shrouded in mystery. Some have argued that they were related to
the Khajiit of Elsweyr. However, there has never been concrete evidence for this
claim, and it is most likely that the IGS grouped them together purely on the
fact that they resembled a mammal, as do the Khajiit. Like their name implies,
the Lilmothiit most likely lived around the Argonian city of Lilmoth. This is
further proven by the fact that the city Blackrose was founded by Lilmothiit
nomads. The Lilmothiit died out somewhere in the Second Era. How is unknown,
however, the Knahaten Flu might be the prime suspect. It is important to note,
however, that their settlement of Blackrose was already long abandoned by 2E
324, more than two hundred years before the start of the Knahaten Flu. If this
could mean that the Lilmothiit were already extinct before the Flu, is up to
debate.

## Imga

The Imga are a race of ape-like creatures from Valenwood. Even though they are
still extant, they are not incredibly well documented. In appearance they
resemble something between an ape and a man. They have developed to living in
the woods, and are incredible nimble climbers. They walk upright. While they are
said to have flourished even before the Aldmer came to Valenwood (meaning that
they were the original inhabitants of the province), they hold the Altmer in the
highest regard, and try to emulate them in every way. As a result, many of the
Great Apes now wear capes, practise duelling, train their speech to better fit
in with higher social circles, and appear to despise any race of men. Along with
this, all Imga take on some royal title, like “duke” or “count” (even though
there are no Imga who hold land), something which sometimes appears comically to
outsiders. Despite going at length to emulate the Altmer, the High Elves look
down upon them, since the High Elves look down upon all non-mer. This only makes
the Imga try harder, though. While not popular with Altmer, they live peacefully
with the Bosmer (which is not that strange, as Bosmer accept races and cultures
of all kinds).
