We’ve been hunting this one for a long time, but I am reasonably confident
(enough to publish) in this answer.

Now, the first two checks against a Stone solution are a) can this be
constructed by the original builders of the Tower, and b) was this broken during
the events of the game featuring the Tower (in this case, *Skyrim*). The High
King, Skyrim’s political state, and other Nord-centric ideas for the Stone were
ruled out by the first, and the Falmer, the Dragons, and other ancient-era
thoughts were ruled out by the second.

Furthermore, let us review the Towers and Stones we know:

- Ada-Mantia: Convention, the Impossipoint. Enabled.
- Red Mountain: Heart of Lorkhan. Disabled.
- Crystal-Like-Law: (A person) Disabled.
- Green-Sap: (A fruit) ?
- Khajiit: Mane. Disabled.
- Orichalc: (A sword) Disabled.
- (anything in the Marsh?, ?, ?)
- Walk-Brass: Heart of Lorkhan and/or the Mantella, both Disabled.
- White-Gold Tower: Chim-el Adabal, the Amulet of Kings. Disabled.

I believe this to be a largely comprehensive list, but it is possible I have
omissions or errors.

So: only one of these Towers has a concept as a Stone: Ada-Mantia. Originally
enacted by the gods, and reinforced by Talos, Ada-Mantia’s Stone is the
asymptotic event that can without doubt be called TIME ZERO. The rest, as far as
we know, utilize physical objects with mythic significance as their stones.
However, Ada-Mantia and Red Mountain are divinely constructed, whereas the
others are all crafted by Elves. Therefore, I see little issue with the idea
that, as the Elven Towers are mimicking the Divine, so too could their Stones: a
Conceptual Stone is within the realm of possibility, if only barely.

We know the Elven Towers were constructed in mimicry of Ada-Mantia so that the
Elves might ascend and return to Aetherius as did their god Auri-El. We also
know that this did not work, and that the Towers in fact served to further
reinforce the Mundus that they view as their prison. A common question is "Why
did the Elves who hate Mundus build Towers to reinforce it?", and this bears a
striking resemblance to a piece of more modern philosophy (anything past Erasmus
is modern to me) by Jung: The Cave story.

In Jung’s Cave, a man reputed to be a sorcerer was in a cave, and he decided
that to escape this cave, he would draw diagrams on the wall. (Mundus’ parallel:
Auri-El was a sorcerer in a cave, and he decided that to escape this cave, he
would use a Tower.) He drew by a process, beginning with an encompassing piece
and refining his process inside it as he went. When he’d finished, his students
in the cave with him looked at his finished drawings and said, aha! We can use
these! So they drew the diagrams seeking the end result already given, rather
than using the old man’s exploratory process, and in doing so they arrived at
the end by an exactly backward path. The parallel in Mundus is this: the Elves
saw the End: Tower Ascension, and built directly towards it, rather than
following the Path. And in so doing, the Towers became inverted and dug down
into Mundus and reinforced it, rather than reaching outwards and allowing the
Elves to leave.

While we don’t know the exact timeline of Tower construction, it’s safe to
assume that they all went up during the same relative period of the Merethic
Era. Given the Jungian-Cave state of the Elven Towers, I believe that the Stone
of Snow-Throat is the Cave-Method of Tower Construction. It exists so long as
the other Elven Towers do.

Now, how did *Skyrim*’s Main Quest break this? The LDB chased the end result
(Alduin banishment) of the Ancient Nord Heroes, but he used a twisted and
altered version of their Path. The mechanics were the same but the process was
vastly different. He did not explore, he followed, and in so doing made mockery
of the action. His eventual defeat of Alduin was both temporary and against the
grain of the original victory, and the close association with Snow-Throat, the
altering of mythic forces by man, and the fact that all other Elven (Cave-built)
Towers of which we know have toppled, meant that the Jung-Cave was strained and
broken, and Snow-Throat has fallen.

To sum up: The Stone of Snow-Throat is the twist-purpose-building of the Elven
Towers. Those Towers are no longer in play, and a replicated
twisted-purpose-process was enacted by the LDB concerning events intimately
related to Snow-Throat. These two effects in combination broke Snow-Throat.

This is built off of the following dialogue, and I am fully aware that I am
extrapolating and could be horribly wrong.
