## Introduction

In keeping with the spirit of writing esoteric extrapolations late at night, I
present to you the sequel of my [previous post][0] concerning the Gods as Tones:
the synæsthesia of Gods, Tones, and Colors. We know that the Magne-Ge are
colors, and given that synæsthesia seems to be a profound mechanic of the
universe (Tonal Architecture is the synæsthesia of Sound and Touch, for
instance), I arrived at the conclusion that the Tones and Colors are merely two
physical translations of the Gods.

## Foundation

Firstly: a quick recap. Go back to the front page of the subreddit, scroll down
until you find my post on Music, and open it. The list of Gods and Tones is
going to be the most important part. (Feel free to open up the song in the
Foreword again, by the way)

Now, follow these links.

- [Sonochromatic scale][1] originally developed to translate color into tone for
  those who could not perceive color.

- [24-Tone Wheel][2] is an image I created to serve as a visual representation
  of the list of God-Tones that I wrote previously. It lacks labeling, but C is
  at the top, and the scale ascends clockwise. Take a minute to study it and get
  a feel for which sections are which notes and gods.

- [Colored Wheel][3]. I used the same three fundamental points (C#, F, A) and
  colors (red, green, blue), as the sonochromatic scale, but moved the colors to
  better suit the TES God-Scale.

## Theory

### Lorkhan, the Beat

Before I delve into the meat of this post, I want to quickly cover one thing.
Look at the blank Wheel. See how the Aedric Tones are long, the 7 Prominent
Daedra are middling, and the 10 Lesser Daedra are the shortest?

Circles are defined as a function of two variables: r (radius) and θ (angle).
The Gods are arrayed using θ, but their status is determined by r. The Gods most
associated with Lorkhan, the Aedra, have the highest r-values. The next level of
Lorkhanic association (the Reclamations are strongly associated with him, and
the House of Troubles are also tied into the kalpic nature of the world, but all
are Daedra) are weaker, but still strong. Lastly, the ten remaining Daedra are
associated with the tones with least commonality and power. As with my Music
post yesterday, Lorkhan continues to be utterly different from, yet equally
necessary, as the rest of the pantheon.

### Color and Tone

I apologize for data-spam, but this is the unified Tone/Color/God table and I’m
going to base the rest of this post off of it. For ease of reading, the Aedra
are in bold and the Prominent Daedra in italics.

|God             |Tone |Hue Angle|
|:--------------:|:---:|:---:|
|**Mara**        |C    |330|
|Namira          |C#^♭^|345|
|*Malacath*      |C#   |0|
|Vaermina        |C#^#^|15|
|**Zenithar**    |D    |30|
|Clavicus Vile   |D#^♭^|45|
|*Mehrunes Dagon*|D#   |60|
|Peryite         |D#^#^|75|
|**Arkay**       |E    |90|
|*Azura*         |E#   |105|
|**Kyne**        |F    |120|
|Meridia         |F#^♭^|135|
|*Molag Bal*     |F#   |150|
|Hircine         |F#^#^|165|
|**Stendarr**    |G    |180|
|Sanguine        |G#^♭^|195|
|*Boethiah*      |G#   |210|
|Nocturnal       |G#^#^|225|
|**Akatosh**     |A    |240|
|Hermaeus Mora   |A#^♭^|255|
|*Sheogorath*    |A#   |270|
|Jyggalag        |A#^#^|285|
|**Julianos**    |B    |300|
|*Mephala*       |B#   |315|
|**Dibella**     |C    |330|

If you remember my definition of the color wheel, you’ll see that C#, Red,
happens to land on a Daedric Prince, whereas the other two are on Aedra (Kyne
and Julianos). This may seem a little strange, considering that one of the
tenets of my Musical Theory of Mundus is that the Aedra are the key Tones and
the Daedra are less important. But look again at just who the pillar is:
MALACATH. Malacath is formerly Trinimiac, an Aedra, who was changed (transposed,
if you will) later on.

As an aside, the number 3 in TES is extremely significant in a few different
overarching ways. One of these, the Triune House, is composed of two extremes
and an intermediary. Trinimalacath is a primarily Elven deity, and Kyne is
primarily human. Julianos, however, is revered by both Elves and Men and his
sphere (magic and intellectualism) is relevant to both.

So. Let’s talk physics and theory (and also terror. *blackens hands*).

While human hearing in our world begins at ~20Hz and extends to ~16kHz, human
sight ranges from 4x10^14 Hz to 8X10^14 Hz. This is a much smaller window and
there are much less color combinations possible than there are musical
combinations. And while both sound and color are linear, they *can* be mapped
onto a circle. With color, this creates non-spectrum colors (the cyan family).
Also, whereas color is a linear/circular set, musical tones are arrayed in a
logarithmic pattern.

However, TES physics are not necessarily identical to those of our own world,
and we would all do well to remember this.

I want you to visualize a helix. It’s a screw: as a point rotates in a circle,
the center moves along an orthogonal axis, creating a twist rather than a closed
loop. If you look at it from the side, you see a sine wave, but if you look at
it head-on, it makes a circle.

The Color and Tone wheels are, in fact, this helix. Each revolution is one
octave. While we can perceive many turns of the Tone Helix, we only see one turn
of the Color Helix. We can, however, assume that the Color Helix extends beyond
our perception in the same manner as Tones do, and that the Gods are associated
with their periodic Colors as they are with periodic Tones (the Octaves).

## Synæsthesia

The mixture of "discrete" senses into single fields is one that features
strongly in TES lore. Pure Song is perceived as all of the mortal senses, since
this Song is what creates the world. Tonal Architecture reshapes the Song and
sculpts matter. The Thu’um translates Voice into Color and Force. Color and Tone
are intertwined in many regards and it is no stretch at all to unify them.
Furthermore, the use of cross-sensory perception in the mythos of Mundus further
illustrates the nature of the Dream state that Godhead, Anu, the Captive Sage,
and perhaps more to come experience.

## Summary

Not only can the world be described through Tone, but also Color. Furthermore,
the two are intimately related and may be two aspects of the same fundamental concept.

That line is pretty much why I wrote this.

Those lines are DEFINITELY why I wrote these.
