Talos is two-faced, existing before and after the present time but never in the
moment. He existed in humanity’s past as the untempered steel of the spirit and
he will manifest again as the forged sword of the Red Diamond. When the Amulet
of Kings was lost in the first Interregnum, the spirit of Alessia appeared to
Hrol, and he made great sundering unto a nearby mountain, which was also a pile
of mud. Alessia is the spark that quickens the flame in humanity’s core.
Morihaus-Breath-Of-Kyne is the bellows which breathes fuel into the furnace.
Reman is the anvil, and Pelinal is the hammer. All these demi-gods are tools of
the Creator, and together they form a forge in the spirits of men. Talos
transforms them from raw steel into killing blade. This is the temporal myth of
men. They disbelieve in the truth of the three-in-three-in-nine and reject the
echoing of eternity. They choose to believe in the legend of transubstantiation,
that men are separated from the gods not by immutable law but a tissue thin
veil. Talos offers men the chance to pierce the veil.
