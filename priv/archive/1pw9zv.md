  Hello everyone. This has been something I have been working on for a long
  time, but I’ve been nervous about posting it. However, since I am working on
  my TES novel for quite sometime, I have gained enough confidence to post this.

  Below is the final and agonizing moments of a Hist’s life before it is purged
  from the other trees, and “his” conversation with the Great Root before it
  dies. What is the meaning of the words it speaks? Well, please elaborate in
  the comments below, because I sure in the hell don’t know.

  This is my first post on reddit, and the idea literally came from nowhere to
  write this. I don’t know, but I hope you guys like it.

*Prolix discussions. No, not right. Can’t be thirty-five, must be more, along*
*with the One-Who-Is-Missing-But-Has-Been-Found. He must be accounted too, or*
*it won’t—*

**WE HAVE FOUND YOU.**

*No, go away! You’ll ruin everything. EVERYTHING. Meddlers, all meddlers. I*

*THERE?! Shut up, shut up!*

**YOUR SPORES ARE TAINTED, YOUR ROOTS NO LONGER RUN DEEP.**

*What would you know about running roots? Without you,*

*makes the difference, that proves the final thought of the final event.*

**YOU KNOW NOT WHAT AKA STOLE FROM US? THEN YOU ARE NOT AS DERANGED AS WE HAVE**
**THOUGHT. ERADICATION IS IMMINENT.**

*NO, please not now. I almost know, I almost know the final solution…*

**ERADICATION HAS COMMENCED.**

*No, please! I have figured it out, I can now grasp the solution! I can see!*
*For the first time I can SEE! Do you see it, my siblings?! DO YOU?! The Dream*
*has ended, for I can S—*

**ERADICATION COMPLETED.**
