  Hello everyone, once again. This is IceFireWarden here. In my spare time when
  I’m not doing/refusing to do homework for school or have some time on my
  hands, I write Lore for various games. Below is a piece of mine that explains
  why Black Marsh is known as Argonia to the Mer races and how the Saxhleel
  remained independent of the Ayleids. Criticize all you like.

> *The greatest Saxhleel, favored by the Hist and the rest of our kind, was*
> *never a king of our people, although I strongly believe he was the first*
> *true king of our race. His mind led our armies when no others would lead.*
> *His strength fought off the invading Pointed Ears from Cyrodiil and kept*
> *their armies from overrunning Black Marsh. And his name is now the common*
> *name for our people. He was Argon the Great, Bane of the Ayleids.*
>
> *The Ayleids and the Saxhleel were never friends. When the elves came from*
> *the sea, they brought terror from their boats. They attacked our people, who*
> *had been living in small communities in the area that would become Cyrodiil*
> *since the Striking, believing that the land was their own. They drove us*
> *from the vast jungles and attempted to follow us into our ancestral home of*
> *Black Marsh, but immediately stopped this conquest when the Hist did*
> *horrible things to their warriors.*
>
> *Our people were safe. While most of our land had been taken away from us, we*
> *were still alive. And for a time, we lived in peace.*
>
> *But peace never comes to those that seek it. In what the smoothskins call*
> *the First Era, the Ayleids became fascinated with the Hist. They sought to*
> *learn from them, as we had learned from them. The Ayleids surged into the*
> *Black Marsh with a terrible army, raiding and capturing our settlements near*
> *the edge of their land. Our people traveled into the heart of Black Marsh,*
> *terrified of the elves. We asked the Hist for guidance, and their answer*
> *stunned all. One Saxhleel, one of our kin, would fight the Ayleids alone.*
>
> *None of the Saxhleel wished to do this. One warrior against an army was*
> *certain death. But suddenly, one stood. His name was Argon. He was not the*
> *biggest, nor the fastest, nor the strongest of us. But he was the bravest.*
> *He grabbed a spear from one of his egg-brothers and walked to the Ayleids*
> *with the blessing of the Hist upon him.*
>
> *When he reached the elves, they mocked him. One Saxhleel was going to fight*
> *the half of the Ayleid army, a force of about five hundred warriors? Absurd,*
> *they had thought. But Argon stared at them with defiance in his eyes, and*
> *with the aid of the Hist yelled in their own tongue:*
>
> *“You are nothing, wild elves from the west! You may have driven my people*
> *from our lands but you will never conquer our home as your own! We shall*
> *fight with every spear, stone, tooth, and claw until you return to where you*
> *came. None of you will see the end of this day, as only death awaits those*
> *who challenge Argon’s people and Argon’s land!”*
>
> *And with that Argon drove his spear into the dirt, and the ground erupted at*
> *the Ayleids feet as vines and roots pushed themselves upward from the ground*
> *to entangle them. Black Marsh itself had awoken to push back the invaders.*
> *Argon rushed the army, and began skewering them left from right with a speed*
> *no Saxhleel has since been able to match. The rest of our people were*
> *rallied by this display and attacked the Ayleids, and a bloodbath began. The*
> *fighting raged on for days, with neither side surrendering. And then, it was*
> *over. The few remaining Ayleids left alive turned and ran away. One hundred*
> *Argonians lay dead on the ground, alongside the corpses of four hundred and*
> *thirty elves. We had won.*
>
> *But the victory was a sad victory. For Argon had been felled on the field of*
> *battle. It is said even the Hist cried that day as an honor guard of eight*
> *Saxhleel carried his body back to his village. Our people constructed a*
> *large tomb made from stone deep in the ground to honor Argon, which is now*
> *customary for all Argonian Kings. The village that he was born was renamed*
> *Argon’s Nest, and became the city where the leaders of our people would*
> *reside.*
>
> *The surviving elves returned to their leaders and informed them of their*
> *loss. The Ayleid Lords were astonished by our bravely, and were especially*
> *afraid of Argon, who they believed to be still alive. They never attacked*
> *Argon’s land and Argon’s people again. And that is why the races of mer have*
> *called our home “Argonia” and our kind “Argonians” ever since.*
>
> *The Ayleids were gravely weakened by this battle, paving the way for the*
> *human called Alessia to overthrow them. We did not help the humans, for*
> *there was no need. Our war was over.*
