This is part of “Shezzar’s Song” as it was originally told.

> Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers, [](){:tag="br"}
> If this magnific titles yet remain. [](){:tag="br"}
> Not merely titular, since by decree [](){:tag="br"}
> Another now has to himself engrossed [](){:tag="br"}
> All power, and us eclipsed under the name [](){:tag="br"}
