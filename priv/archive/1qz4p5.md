\[Fragments of Conversations between Molag Bal and the Ruddy Man, as the latter
becomes replaced by the former]

{The Ruddy Man text is in italics. The Molag Bal text is in bold}

*I SEE YOU.*

**I KNOW YOU DO.**

*WE ARE THE SAME.*

**AT LEAST WE WERE, US TWO.**

*I REMEMBER THE TIME WE SHARED OTHERS' TOILS.*

**NOW I GRAB THEIR SOULS AS A PART OF THE SPOILS.**

*WE USED TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE WHO WERE MAIMED.*

**I RELISH AT THE THOUGHT OF BESTOWING PAIN.**

*DO YOU EVEN REMEMBER HOW WE USED TO LOVE?*

**I REMEMBER HOW I LOVE THE SMELL OF BLOOD.**

*AT THE THOUGHT OF TYRANNY OUR HEARTS USED TO SHATTER.*

**THE ART OF CONQUEST IS ALL THAT MATTERS.**

*CAN’T YOU SHED TEARS OVER THOSE WHO’VE DIED?*

**TEARS DO NOT SHED FOR THOSE WHO CAN’T CRY.**

*I THINK I SEE.*

**I’VE MADE YOU BELIEVE.**

*WE ARE WHAT WE ARE NOW BECAUSE I LOST. HOW COULD HAVE THIS BEEN DONE?*

**WE ARE WHAT WE ARE NOW BECAUSE I WAS THE ONE THAT WON.**
