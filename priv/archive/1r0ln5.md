  This post is my attempt at synthesizing and explaining a number of concepts
  that, while understood among scholars, have rarely been explored at length
  outside of original documents. I am certain that this is probably all kinds of
  wrong, but it’s the best I’ve been able to do with a close reading of the
  Loveletter and quite a bit of mental wrangling. By all means, tear apart each
  and every flaw or inadequacy you can find.

Imagine the entirety of the Elder Scrolls as a gradient scale going from
upper-left to lower-right, along which lies all the various states of existence
we are familiar with.

On the extreme upper-left end is the Godhead — the original and incomprehensible
entity that creates all else in its Dream.

The primal state of the Godhead’s Dream is known as the Void.

Within the Void exist two concepts, Infinity and Change. Anu and Padomay. Their
relationship is known as Aurbis.

Anu and Padomay, respectively, create Anuiel and Sithis, reflections of
themselves usually described as their “souls”.

Anuiel and Sithis create the Time Dragon and the Unstable Mutant, first of the
et’Ada: To the Aldmer, Auri-El and Lorkhan. To the Imperials, Akatosh and
Shezarr. To the Nords, Aka-tusk and Shor. Other et’Ada emerge, some more aligned
to Anu and some to Padomay, and reside in their kingdom of Aetherius.

The Time Dragon and the Unstable Mutant, at the latter’s urging, create Mundus,
the Material Prison, along with a host of other et’Ada. By this process they
also bind themselves to it, a (perhaps forced) subgradience into mortal beings
known as Aedra.

The et’Ada who refused to participate in this creation, realizing the trap of
mortality, instead create their own realms in Oblivion, the echo of the
primordial Void.

From here, men and mer differ: men believe that they were created directly by
the hand of the Aedra, while mer believe themselves to be their descendants.
This disagreement is the single most important philosophical divide in the
history of Nirn.

Basically, it looks like [this][0].

Nearly every significant mythic or metaphysical concept in the Elder Scrolls can
be fit neatly into this paradigm:

**CHIM** is realizing the existence of the extreme upper-left gradient without
negating oneself.

**Amaranth** is… well, let’s just consult the Elk here.

**Apotheosis** is shifting, from mortality, one gradient to the left — not
proper Aedra, but their equals, known as gods.

**Creation**, as a proper noun, is the formation of Mundus, an act which
required the concurrent sub-gradation of et’Ada to Aedra, and the introduction
of mortality into the Dream.
