  Please note that I made most of this information up myself. Very little of
  this came from actual official sources. Thanks.

During my travels to the northern province of Skyrim to study the various unique
fauna of the region, I found the Chaurus species to be particularly interesting.
While not very different from other large insect species found throughout
Tamriel, they seem to have an interesting relationship with the feral Falmer
tribes found within the region’s caves and Dwemer ruin networks.

Chauri are large violet segmented insects that resemble earwigs, usually found
accompanying the Falmer of Skyrim. They usually can grow up to 5 feet long.
(However some reports claim specimens as large as twenty feet long but are
unconfirmed.) Just under the mandible joints of the Chaurus are sacs of
corrosive venom that can melt through iron with ease. The Chaurus are able to
spit this venom at distances of up to thirty feet to catch prey, which they
usually hunt for at night, when they prowl outside of their caves, attacking any
creatures they come across whether that be elk, wolves, bears, or even people.
The venom also coats their mandibles, which allows them to easily tunnel through
rock and stone. As the Chaurus gets older, it grows into the larger, more
aggressive “Reaper” Life stage. This is the stage when the Chaurus are ready to
breed.

During breeding, a mated pair will burrow into a cave wall together where they
will mate for up to two weeks after which they will leave the hole and the
female will lay a large cluster of round blue eggs in communal caves covered
with resinous bioluminescent goo. the eggs will usually hatch after 4 months,
the young larvae are usually 4 inches long, but will quickly grow to younger, 3
foot long nymphs which will continue to slowly grow to mature size over the
course of their lifetime.

Another commonly encountered form of the Chaurus is the wasp-like “Hunter”.

After a certain period of time in the Chaurus’ Reaper stage, the creature will
become sluggish and enter a comatose death like state (previous researchers have
confused this for actual death.) Its body will become bloated and turn into a
chrysalis where the the Hunter will grow.

The Chrysalis seems to be sensitive to nearby vibrations as the Hunter has been
known to stay in its chrysalis waiting for a potential first prey to wander by
before it will emerge, and some Hunters (called fledglings) have been known to
emerge to capture prey before they are fully matured. During autopsies of Chauri
specimens, I found structures which seem to be analogous to “imaginal disks”
found in the larvae of other insect species which grow into the sections and
organs of the insect they grow into during the pupa phase.

It has been suggested that other forms of Chaurus exist, but such specimens have
yet to be produced.
