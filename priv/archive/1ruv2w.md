  IceFireWarden, Hist Minder here. Today I’ll be trying to decipher possible
  links between with the Lizard-Men of the Swamps and the Serpent-Men of the
  East. Are they actually related somehow? Let us find out. So pull a chair,
  stoke the fire, and drink some Ovaltine. Commencing Talking.

  JSYK (Just So You Know): I may use some of these sources two or three times in
  this piece, mainly because they include multiple interesting texts within
  them. You have been informed.

For both races, the Striking seems to represent a notion of sudden, swift, but
very powerful change. The first meeting between Anu (Stasis) and Padomay
(Change) that resulted in the Static-Change that because the Aurbis can be
considered the ‘First’ Striking. After that, the meaning changes of the Striking
changes between the two races. Further in The Tsaesci Creation Myth, the
Striking term also appears to represent Lorkhan’s actions in creating Nirn. In
More on the Psijic Endeavor, the Striking represents the Argonian/Hist way of
reaching CHIM.

## Second Relationship: Naming

The usage of names is the second important link between the Tsaesci and the
Argonians that is worth mentioning. In Black Marsh, every Saxhleel undergoes a
ceremony known as a ‘Naming Day’. During this ceremony the young Argonian steps
up to a Hist tree and licks it, ingesting its sap and becoming an teenager/adult
by being given a name. The name the Saxhleel receives reflects on his/her
behavior (e.g. Hides-His-Eyes; Traveling-New-Woman; Scouts-Many-Marshes) and
sets them apart from their other kinsmen. To put it simply, an Argonian’s name
is the very essence of their individuality.

In the Tsaesci Creation Myth, there are twelve worlds of creation for ‘each of
the serpents who have a name’. The names were also ‘alive’ and became more eggs,
for names are ‘self-maters’ and the Naming continued. To me, this sounds like
the Tsaesci are recording the creation of the Aurbis and its self-expansion. As
it expands, the universe consequently ‘names’ itself over and over again.
Another tidbit I’m interested in is ‘the serpents who have a name’, but I’ll
save that for later on in this document.

Overall, the process of Naming appears incredibly important to both cultures.
Everything must have a name.

## Third Relationship: Egg Worldview

Both the Argonians and the Tsaesci seem to have an egg-based view on the Aurbis,
and it can be the reason why they use terms such as “Striking”, “Biting”, or
“Laying” in their societies. This view can also be a result (probably definitely
a result) of both races connections with reptilian creatures.

## Fourth Reason: Gods

Out of all the information present, this is what piques my curiosity the most.
The Argonian and Tsaesci pantheons are probably the least well known out of all
the pantheons of Nirn. Z’en becoming an Elvish god after once being an Argonian
god is fairly fascinating (in theory). But the connection with Akavir is where
things start to get really interesting. It could fairly well be possible that
Z’en is a shared entity between the Saxhleel and the Tsaesci.

In regards to the Lessons, the lizard gods can strongly hint or strongly not
hint towards the Argonians or the Tsaesci. However, it is the use of the term
“the Striking” that leads me to believe that the passage may be referring to the
deities of both groups.

## Fifth Reason: On Boethiah’s Summoning Day

> _On Boethiah’s Summoning Day_{:tag="cite"}

While not the most trustworthy source, this piece also strongly hints at a
relationship – this time biological – between the Argonians and the Tsaesci. The
Unnamed Lord clearly refers to Sithis/Padomay, and the text calls the Saxhleel
its worshippers (this isn’t that hard to consider, giving the Argonians strong
view on change in their society). The Serpent-Men are also clearly the Akaviri
known as the Tsaesci, who share some attributes with the Daedric Prince
Boethiah.

---

However, the Summoning Day basically states that somehow Boethiah and the
Tsaesci got together and made little Argonians (essentially). This is weird,
considering that it’s the Hist that gave the Argonian’s life. So what is the
text implying?
