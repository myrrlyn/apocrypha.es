Over a rotational vellus cycle, under a false logic cube, between semi-coherent
magic-mirrors and taking a left turn at a fur fork did Sotha Sil float up in a
spherical space and into the hall of the Mane.

The Mane deeply giggled and greeted

> “Welcome Sil of lost house here is self how wife friend dead though friends
> live we salt but fresh friend answer”

Sil, accustomed to unusual manners of language, responded “I am my house, though
it has died. Some things must go for the benefit of others. This is the nature
of all affairs of people. If you wish to know of my friend, ask him yourself;
you and he both have the means to do so.”

> “some must go some must stay who will you choose the time of day finds dawn
> when will your dawn shine if keeping within explain”

“the idle of amusements of one may be the solemn tortures of another. Speak of
one issue at one time. I have conversed with Daedric Princes speaking over and
beside one another in tongues ancient and unique; and that means I am very tired
of this.”

> “explain”

“Do not be difficult for its own sake, I am your guest and an uncomplaisant host
is a situation I do not care to remain in.”

> “why proud dirt mer smell after cleaning and crawl by waste how will you
> protect without a shield or fight without a sword reply”

“I will command the expendable lives in favour of those more valuable”

> “where is one evaluated retort”

“In the eyes and minds of the ALMSIVI; and, regrettably, in the pockets and bank
logs of the greedy and comfortably wealthy”

> “what is lesser”

“Those that are neither of my people or of noble aspirations.”

> “where are they born?”

“What?”

> “where is sword forged and shield shaped”

“From both Nirn and Oblivion.”

> “do you trust what is lesser than self”

“I have to.”

> “Must I trust builders that are not self”

“The affairs of you and your people are not my business. What you do with
yourself in this… structure is of little relevance”

> “the symbol singers sought this through construct of souls your enemy subject
> experience this home and craft sword and shield for self from self”

“I do—”

> “embrace the structure of self to make the shapes protect and kill you must
> multiply godhood study this to change self then build self then make self
> farewell.”

The Mane, in his usual smile and purposeful glance, continued looking at Sotha
Sil as a braid of hair gave him an artifact. It was unique, unlike anything
crafted or formed by the Dwemer and ran magickal rivers throughout itself and
around dried blood. Seht was going to thank him for the gift, but an
understanding smile and nod was enough for the two of them.
