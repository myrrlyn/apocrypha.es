## Indoril Nerevar, “Appeal to the Lizard-Men”

> *Vivec does not agree with what I have decided to do. Neither does Dagoth,*
> *for the matter. But it must be done. We will need as much aid as we can*
> *possibly get if we hope to survive this war with our kin the Dwemer. If what*
> *are scouts have reported is true, our underground-loving cousins have the*
> *support of the Northern Men, the Orcs, and the Furred Ones of the west. How*
> *could we, even with a force as powerful as ours, even hope to fight that?*
> *That is why we are traveling through these godforsaken bogs, hoping to*
> *request a peace council with the Lizard-Men. They hate us, and we hate them*
> *back. But today we must put aside our differences and pride and ask for*
> *their help. The Argonians might be quiet and reluctant to trust, but they*
> *are great warriors when properly trained. They must listen to our request,*
> *they must. For this…Numidium, as Sotha calls it, must be destroyed at all*
> *costs. It is an affront to our gods, and Dumac knows this! So why would he*
> *build it? I believed we were friends. Alas, I was so wrong…*

## Vivec, “The Trees Allow It”

> *These primitive lizards of the swamp, in my opinion, cannot be trusted. We*
> *have been raiding their borders for many years, and yet they still try to*
> *resist us. Tribal primitives, all of them. Why would Nerevar seek to ally*
> *himself with these creatures? The Chimeri people will not seek to the level*
> *of the Dwemer, enthralling allies into a war that is not theirs to fight in.*
> *Our people should stand strong or die trying as they always have, and by*
> *doing this my love for them would only increase. But the primitives have*
> *stated that their ‘trees’ have permitted them to fight alongside us, and*
> *this has made Nerevar happier than I have seen him in days. I do not want to*
> *reduce him back to his somber face that blemishes his beauty, but I do not*
> *trust these Argonians.*

## Alandro-Sul, “Spears”

> *These damn “Argonians” will not relinquish their inadequate weapons for the*
> *more advanced weaponry of our race, the ingrates! How do they believe they*
> *can strike deathblows to the Dwemeri metal creatures with spears instead of*
> *enchanted swords and axes? And let’s not even start on how they are slowing*
> *down our march by bringing that ludicrous tree along with them, carrying it*
> *as if was one of their very ancestors. Vivec told me about how the lizards*
> *said their trees had “told” them to go. I fear that Nerevar has called on a*
> *troop of mad creatures to aid us in the battle.*

## Voryn Dagoth, “Interesting…”

> *Vivec and Alandro seem quite angry at Nerevar, for reasons I do not*
> *understand. What is wrong with the Argonians? Is it their looks? Their*
> *customs? Or is it just the arrogant pride of those two that blinds their*
> *rational thought? We need the lizard-men as much as we needed the Dwemer*
> *themselves to fight against the Northern men. And I am glad that they also*
> *brought this… “Hist” along with them, as they call it. Some gargantuan tree*
> *that they can’t fight without, I assume. Let’s just hope it helps them*
> *strike death blows at our enemies.*

## Dro’Zira, “Shellbacks”

> *Dro’Zira saw before all the others saw them. Marching on the horizon, armed*
> *with shields and pointy sticks. They looked much like the turtles that*
> *Dro’Zira would play with back home in the forests of his homeland with his*
> *littermates. Maybe the turtles had finally come out to play too?*

## Dumac Dwarfking, “We Meet Again”

> *When I saw the tree, it’s branches billowing on the skyline, I knew*
> *somewhere down within myself that there was no more need to fight. The*
> *legions of Nords, the Orcs, and Dro’Zira were standing behind me, the cloak*
> *of the Ash-King billowing in the smoky wind. Today is not a fine day for a*
> *battle. The Mountain is fuming more than it usually is, which must be a*
> *result of our automaton production. But here I go again, thinking about*
> *things that do not matter at the moment. My overactive brain. I should call*
> *Wulfharth over, and tell him we should surrender – for if that is a Hist*
> *tree over the horizon, then we have already lost.*

## Wulfharth, “Demons”

> *A tree? Hah, those Devils were trying to fight us with trees?! One utterance*
> *of a word and I could blow that thing into logs for a new cabin – by Shor,*
> *what are those creatures. They are nothing I have ever seen before. Have the*
> *Devils summoned monsters from terrible places to help defeat us? By the*
> *gods, the stories of snake-headed creatures roaming the southern lands are*
> *true! Now here we are, underneath the red and black sky of Red Mountain,*
> *fighting Devils and their Demons.*
