```verse
Twice the night before Saturalia,
And throughout Nirn.
All the races were silent,
Not even a murm.

The Altmer were gloating,
And preaching Elven might.
The Thalmor were ready,
To blow out Man’s light.

The Bosmer were hunting,
Animals ran for their lives.
But the forest people kept chase,
And later carved them with knives.

The Orcs were working,
Hammers formed swords.
They made the winter warm,
From the heat of their forge.

The Dunmer were teaching,
The fall of the Tribune.
To never repeat their mistakes,
Or evoke their ancestor’s doom.

The Maormer were swimming,
Racing home before tide.
Their snakes were hungry,
So they quickened their stride.

The Dwemer were missing,
They once stood tall.
Now nothing of them remains,
Except the silence within their halls.

The Falmer were sitting,
And saw the world with their ears.
Their eyes were enclosed,
But they still shed some tears.

The Ayleids were plotting,
Dead they were not.
But gone were there kingdoms,
And what remained was sickness, a blot.

The Khajiit were laughing,
The harvesting was done.
And when the refining was over,
Moonsugar for everyone.

The Argonians were naming,
The scribes turned their page.
For there is nothing else worth recording,
Then an hatchling becoming of age.

The Imga were leaping,
Swinging from tree to tree.
For on this day,
No knowledge needed to be heed.

The Hist were comparing,
Changes in the here and the now.
Omitting when necessary,
Parts like the where and the how.

The Sload were killing,
Playing fun games with the dead.
Some were even cheating,
To try to get ahead.

The Kamal were freezing,
They had no more need to attack.
But then there will be melting,
And they’ll be back.

The Tsaesci were eating,
Not a creature was left.
But the knowledge they gained,
Could not be considered theft.

The Tang Mo were dancing,
No more work to be done.
So they tore down their garrison’s,
And had a bit of fun.

The Ka Po’Tun were roaring,
Not one of them was shy,
Tosh Raka’s was the best of them all,
And made them all cry.

The Redguards were sailing,
No longer at home on their sands.
And voyaged they did,
To celebrate in their ancient lands.

The Nords were feasting,
And they sang with the Bards.
As they recited songs of old,
About the heroes of the Sovngarde.

The Bretons were cheering,
Celebration was in the air.
Throughout the kingdoms,
All was fair.

The Imperials were yawning,
No reading of reports from afar.
Even the Emperor was relaxing,
At the local bar.

The Aedra were sleeping,
The end of the year was like the echoes of a chime.
They went back to sleep,
Impervious to time.

The Daedra were waiting,
Their shrines opened to rovers.
Because there is no day of the year,
Where there games are ever over.

And while there will soon be war,
While other races just fight.
Right now there is silence,
So let there be peace through the night.
