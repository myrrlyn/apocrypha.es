Twice the night before Saturalia, [](){:tag="br"}
And throughout Nirn. [](){:tag="br"}
All the races were silent, [](){:tag="br"}
Not even a murm.

The Altmer were gloating, [](){:tag="br"}
And preaching Elven might. [](){:tag="br"}
The Thalmor were ready, [](){:tag="br"}
To blow out Man’s light.

The Bosmer were hunting, [](){:tag="br"}
Animals ran for their lives. [](){:tag="br"}
But the forest people kept chase, [](){:tag="br"}
And later carved them with knives.

The Orcs were working, [](){:tag="br"}
Hammers formed swords. [](){:tag="br"}
They made the winter warm, [](){:tag="br"}
From the heat of their forge.

The Dunmer were teaching, [](){:tag="br"}
The fall of the Tribune. [](){:tag="br"}
To never repeat their mistakes, [](){:tag="br"}
Or evoke their ancestor’s doom.

The Maormer were swimming, [](){:tag="br"}
Racing home before tide. [](){:tag="br"}
Their snakes were hungry, [](){:tag="br"}
So they quickened their stride.

The Dwemer were missing, [](){:tag="br"}
They once stood tall. [](){:tag="br"}
Now nothing of them remains, [](){:tag="br"}
Except the silence within their halls.

The Falmer were sitting, [](){:tag="br"}
And saw the world with their ears. [](){:tag="br"}
Their eyes were enclosed, [](){:tag="br"}
But they still shed some tears.

The Ayleids were plotting, [](){:tag="br"}
Dead they were not. [](){:tag="br"}
But gone were there kingdoms, [](){:tag="br"}
And what remained was sickness, a blot.

The Khajiit were laughing, [](){:tag="br"}
The harvesting was done. [](){:tag="br"}
And when the refining was over, [](){:tag="br"}
Moonsugar for everyone.

The Argonians were naming, [](){:tag="br"}
The scribes turned their page. [](){:tag="br"}
For there is nothing else worth recording, [](){:tag="br"}
Then an hatchling becoming of age.

The Imga were leaping, [](){:tag="br"}
Swinging from tree to tree. [](){:tag="br"}
For on this day, [](){:tag="br"}
No knowledge needed to be heed.

The Hist were comparing, [](){:tag="br"}
Changes in the here and the now. [](){:tag="br"}
Omitting when necessary, [](){:tag="br"}
Parts like the where and the how.

The Sload were killing, [](){:tag="br"}
Playing fun games with the dead. [](){:tag="br"}
Some were even cheating, [](){:tag="br"}
To try to get ahead.

The Kamal were freezing, [](){:tag="br"}
They had no more need to attack. [](){:tag="br"}
But then there will be melting, [](){:tag="br"}
And they’ll be back.

The Tsaesci were eating, [](){:tag="br"}
Not a creature was left. [](){:tag="br"}
But the knowledge they gained, [](){:tag="br"}
Could not be considered theft.

The Tang Mo were dancing, [](){:tag="br"}
No more work to be done. [](){:tag="br"}
So they tore down their garrison’s, [](){:tag="br"}
And had a bit of fun.

The Ka Po’Tun were roaring, [](){:tag="br"}
Not one of them was shy, [](){:tag="br"}
Tosh Raka’s was the best of them all, [](){:tag="br"}
And made them all cry.

The Redguards were sailing, [](){:tag="br"}
No longer at home on their sands. [](){:tag="br"}
And voyaged they did, [](){:tag="br"}
To celebrate in their ancient lands.

The Nords were feasting, [](){:tag="br"}
And they sang with the Bards. [](){:tag="br"}
As they recited songs of old, [](){:tag="br"}
About the heroes of the Sovngarde.

The Bretons were cheering, [](){:tag="br"}
Celebration was in the air. [](){:tag="br"}
Throughout the kingdoms, [](){:tag="br"}
All was fair.

The Imperials were yawning, [](){:tag="br"}
No reading of reports from afar. [](){:tag="br"}
Even the Emperor was relaxing, [](){:tag="br"}
At the local bar.

The Aedra were sleeping, [](){:tag="br"}
The end of the year was like the echoes of a chime. [](){:tag="br"}
They went back to sleep, [](){:tag="br"}
Impervious to time.

The Daedra were waiting, [](){:tag="br"}
Their shrines opened to rovers. [](){:tag="br"}
Because there is no day of the year, [](){:tag="br"}
Where there games are ever over.

And while there will soon be war, [](){:tag="br"}
While other races just fight. [](){:tag="br"}
Right now there is silence, [](){:tag="br"}
So let there be peace through the night.
