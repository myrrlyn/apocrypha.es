## Verse I: The Plot of Beranil

In the day of broken shackles

In the hour of long-sought freedom

Anica, the Lady fairest

Of the flowers of the Niben,

Anica, whose hair was saffron,

Anica who spoke in silver,

Dwelt among the canes and willows,

Dwelt among the Men of Sedor,

Strong-limbed, red-eyed Men of Sedor.

Strode sweet Anica by moonlight,

Strode bright Anica in silence

By the waters of the River,

Mother of us all, the Niben,

Sleepless with anticipation,

Wracked with thoughts of matrimony.

Many suitors plied this Lady,

Sought her hand to take in marriage,

Offered gold and fine-carved amber,

Sang their fathers and forefathers,

Sought the hand of Anica then.

Elf-King Beranil, he spied her,

Saw her from his grave white tower,

Beranil the Golden-Handed,

Beranil who coveted her,

Sought her for his living garden,

Sought to bind her for his pleasure.

When the cruel lord saw the Lady,

When the dread elf spied her beauty,

He, the slaver, cried in anguish,

Cried that he possessed poor fortune,

Wailed the gods had him forsaken.

He resolved to pluck the flower,

He made oaths to capture his prize,

Offered many slaves to demons,

Tore their hearts as food for monsters,

Rent their limbs to make his arrows,

Scried the future in their livers,

Fed their eyes to his dark eagles.

Many elves this lord commanded,

Large the host of this foul Elf-King,

Spears like forests spread before him,

Beranil commanded legions,

Mighty were his dark faced soldiers.

Knowing Anica dwelt with them,

Anica the worthy Lady,

Beranil devised his purpose,

Wove his cunning plans by darkness,

Thought to break the Men of Sedor,

Sought to crush them with his powers,

Drive their heroes to the River,

See them drowned in Mother Water,

See them drowned in their own heart-blood.

Beranil then called his soldiers,

Gathered all his far-flung forces,

Drew them to him as his armor,

Gathered them to be his weapon.

## Verse II: The Challenge of Unno and the Oath of Anica

By the bright hearths of the Sedor,

In their sturdy timbered dwellings,

Heroes reveled in their freedom,

Boasted of their many doings,

Told of deeds performed in valor,

Sang the deaths of many Elf-Lords,

Drawn by Anica, fair Lady,

Hoping to take her as hearth-wife.

When these mighty men had gathered,

When the strength of Mother Niben

Had arrayed itself in splendor,

Mighty Unno, son of Pallo,

Scar-backed Unno, born in bondage,

Broad-faced Unno, Elfkind’s menace

Called upon the Men of Sedor,

Spoke to those who gathered with him

“Men of Sedor, full of vigor,

Who among you now is worthy

To defend these well-lit hearth fires,

To protect your halls and honor?

Cunning Elf-Lords plot against us,

Seek our ruin in their doings.

Show us now your battle prowess,

Demonstrate your feats of virtue

That you may stand firm against the

Cruel-faced slavers who once chained us!”

When grand Unno this had spoken,

When these words his tongue had given,

Anica arose in beauty,

Anica stood tall before them,

Lady who commanded honor,

Stood before the Men of Sedor,

Gave to them her bold proposal,

Offered them her splendid challenge,

Saying this unto the masses:

“Men of Sedor, rightly honored,

Nobly granted every virtue,

I have heard proud Unno’s challenge,

I have heard his thoughtful speaking.

Now I offer this vow to you,

Now I make this declaration:

He who proves his worth most ably,

He who demonstrates his valor

In grave combat with the Elf-Lords,

I shall take him as my husband,

I shall bear him many children.

This I vow before Dibella

And by mighty Mother Water.

If I break this oath before you,

Let my sight be taken from me,

Let my fingers break and weaken,

Let my sons be taken captive,

Let me end my days in torment!”

When she made this vow before them,

When fair Anica had spoken,

All the men were filled with wonder,

Hearing what the Lady promised.

Every heart was filled with vigor,

Every limb with high ambition,

And those splendid Men of Sedor,

Red-eyed, long-limbed Men of Sedor,

All prepared to meet the challenge.
