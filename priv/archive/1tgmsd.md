Before we start I would just like to put two excerpts/quotes out there this one:

> “Because of this connection with the Emperors, however, the other significance
> of the Dragonborn has been obscured and largely forgotten by all but scholars
> and those of us dedicated to the service of the blessed Talos, Who Was Tiber
> Septim. **Very few realize that being Dragonborn is not a simple matter of**
> **heredity – being the blessing of Akatosh Himself,** it is beyond our
> understanding exactly how and why it is bestowed. Those who become Emperor and
> light the Dragonfires are surely Dragonborn – the proof is in the wearing of
> the Amulet and the lighting of the Fires. But were they Dragonborn and thus
> able to do these things – or was the doing the sign of the blessing of Akatosh
> descending upon them? All that we can say is that it is both, and neither – a
> divine mystery.”

And this one:

> “One upon a time, **there were many Dragonborn**, the gift passed down through
> the generations. Over time, though, the bloodlines faded along with their
> importance, until all that was left was **the Septims.** Your character in
> *Skyrim*, though, is from one of the **lost lines of Dragonborn,** maybe even
> the last one.”

## The Origins of the Dovah – Sos

For years, we thought that the Septims – The Emperors of Tamriel – were the last
of the Dragonborn, an apparently once plentiful group of people blessed by
Akatosh. The term itself was first used when St. Alessia was given the Amulet of
Kings and the Dragonfires were first lit at the Temple of the One in the
Imperial City. She was actually the first to be *called* Dragonborn which means
there were Dragonborn before her, a well known example of this is Miraak (a.k.a.
Allegiance Guide.) Now see Mr. Allegiance Guide here was a Dragonborn and a
Dragon Priest, infact he was the first ever Dragonborn, he was the first one to
ever actually kill Dragons and absorb their souls, now this is something all
Dragonborn can do, or should be able to do. But all that stuff with Allegiance
Guide happened waaay back during the Merethic Era, an era most Imperial scholars
during the first era didn’t give a fuck about, thus they called St. Alessia (did
I mention she was called Al-Esh at one point?) the first Dragonborn. But
remember what Todd Howard said? “Once upon a time, there were many Dragonborn”
what does that mean you ask? It means that Akatosh probably blessed a shitload
of people with dragonblood at one point, he did go mad once, did you know that?
Well to be fair he was split by a bunch of Ape cultists called the Marukhati
Selectives, but that’s not why we are here. Since there were once a bountiful
amount of dragonborn at one point, you can say that they all led lives of Glory
and Honor, like a true Nord! *Raaaggghh!!!* but they probably didn’t. They
probably lived normal boring lives as traders, farmers, and maybe even soldiers,
but there is really no way to prove it back then.

## Being a Dragonborn – Los Do Tiid

Now of course there’s only three ways to verify Dragonbornicity; One kill a
dragon, sadly after centuries of dragon hunting, dragons became a rare sight in
Tamriel. Two train with the Greybeards, suuure I bet any Emperor would want to
throw away a life of luxury, and glory just so he can train with a bunch of old
men who live in a mountain, and eat preserved food. And the third (and final)
way to find out if someone is a Dragonborn is The Amulet of Kings, but sadly
Martin Septim died for you, so no one’s gonna find that thing anymore.

So what does that mean? Being a Dragonborn *IS ABOUT TIME.* Born too late?
Someone killed of all the dragons, and the Amulet of Kings is gone, so no one
would know. Born too early? Well sorry bro dragons were wiped out by the
Dragonguard, oh and you can’t touch the Amulet of Kings cause your not an
Emperor, go near it and *YOU DIE BITCH.*  So now we know a lot of Dragonborn (or
is it Dragonborns?) existed at one point, and the only **known,** – until the
events of TESV Skyrim of course – were the Septims. Too bad that one guy turned
into a dragon, I mean damn bro I wasn’t expecting that. And post-Septims we were
left with 200 years of no Dragonborn right? Fuck no. Like I said there was no
way to know if you were the Dragonborn during that time hell anyone could’ve
been Dragonborn, for all we know Glarthir could’ve been Dragonborn. But we
wouldn’t know, would we?

> —*Prophecy of the Dragonborn, said to come from an Elder Scroll*{:tag="cite"}

*But the Elder Scrolls Foretold It!* Yeah the scroll foretold it, you know what
else they foretold? The sun would disappear, and Alduin (a.k.a. Destroyer Devour
Master) would win. Which obviously they did not. You see the Elder Scrolls are a
huge matter of debate and they always tell the truth even if it’s not. The
Scrolls foretell possibilities, endless possibilities, they are full of
knowledge that just reading one will *probably* blast you with 10 Billion
Gigawatts of Knowledge to the face, hence blindness. The Elder Scrolls are
obscure and the readers are usually blinded after reading them, hell they even
have a hard time reading the scrolls at times, and you also have to take into
consideration the sanity of the reader. I’m not saying Moth Priests are mad but
going through years of training just to blind yourself would probably make me
go mad. In short The Elder Scrolls record everything that was, is, could be, and
could have been true, and it also depends on the reader on what they will see.
Well you see this one particular prophecy is false, and true. Well it’s false in
a sense that your Player Character in Skyrim -the same guy who stripped clothing
from someone of the opposite gender and wore it- defeated Alduin, so this means
it’s not the end of time yet even if Destroyer Devour Master is back from the
Merethic Era. And it’s true in sense that *in theory* Alduin will keep returning
and a Dragonborn may or may not face him every time, until Alduin wins, the poor
guy just wanted to eat Nirn. And when he does finally get to eat Nirn we will
get a New Kalpa, so *yaaaayy more Indian word things!!!*

Now back to the topic at hand, sure all the other things in the prophecy
happened but are you sure those events are what the prophecy refers to? we are
just in the fourth era, and if we follow MK’s writings there will be a lot more,
meaning a lot of time for things similar to this to happen. If you didn’t
understand the last sentence let’s put it this way; There could be another
Dragon Break. Some other guys could be thrice blessed and the Red Mountain will
most probably erupt again. And a Dragonborn could return to the throne, and then
somewhere down the line lose it. And Skyrim will most likely lose a king again.
And Destroyer Devour Master will return to fight another Dragonborn.

## The Prior and the Wahlaan

What of the two first Quotes, don’t they contradict? Well the Book of the
Dragonborn, is written in the Point of View of a Prior studying the Dragonborn,
also note that she states "it is beyond our understanding exactly how and why it
is bestowed." Her theory is just that, a theory, subjected to debate,
argumentative, and dubious. Though the Dragonborn are blessed by Akatosh, what
of Miraak? Surely good old Allegiance Guide was a devout follower of Akatosh
who prayed at the chapel right? Probably not. My theory regarding Miraak is he
*was* a Dragon Priest, and Dragons are creations of Akatosh, and he also did
have access to Apocrypha were almost all knowledge is stored. (Those damned
Skaal!) He could have found a way to somehow become Dragonborn, possibly not via
Akatosh’s blessing. Exactly how is anyone’s guess. And this in-universe
explanation doesn’t have to contradict with Todd Howard’s words (If you don’t
know who he is, he’s the Wahlaan) since they can actually support each other in
a really small theorized way. Akatosh can bless someone with dragonblood, and
that dragonblood becomes hereditary, meaning your Dovahkiin (a.k.a. Dragon
Hunter Child) if he or she has kids will be Dragonborn. But if the Dragonblood
that Dragon Hunter Child has is hereditary or a blessing is debatable, depending
on who you believe.

## Ark Ful?

Well if you still don’t know how this will matter, and why this is relevant
here’s how; Dragonborn Emperors could return, Dragon Shouts could return in
Future Games, And the Blades will have a purpose. Of course those aren’t the
only applications of having more dragonborn, I would like to hear how you guys
think a future Dragonborn could be used, in the comments. And also your
opinions, and your own theories based on what I stated here.

P.S. I will just post the Translations of the Dragon Language stuff in the
comments later, need to rest for awhile. Unless of course someone else does it
before me.
