In the Old Life Festival, we reflect on the year we have just lived in, and we
try to think about the future year. It’s held on the last day of the year:
30^th^ of Evening Star.

We go to the temples of the eight,nine,sheogorath and whatever god(s) you
worship. There we reflect on our past,asking for forgiveness for our sins and
rewards for our good habits. This mostly happens in the morning,as there is a
whole festival to come.

It is said that the priest of the nine/eight will heal your loved ones for free.
Most people know better than believing that,except for the nords as their
priests always do it for free. Some people even bring their dead loved ones
hoping that a holy priest might just do some necromancy (sarcasm).

Of course we already talked about Saturalia where the people drink untill their
bodies are full of wine or ale,here they drink even more. The inns and tavern
give away free wine,ale and beer. So even the beggars can get drunk. Yes, I know
what you’re thinking if you’ve read my article on Saturalia,but the thieves are
also drunk and the few who aren’t have the manners not to steal on this
beautiful day.

That means the end of the year,a year full of sins and heroic actions,
bootlicking and treachary, fun and boredom. Thanks for reading and more on the
New Life Festival later.
