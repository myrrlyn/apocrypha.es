I have noticed in recent years that the relations between our political faction,
the Crowns, and the Forebears, have changed drastically due to the Thalmor
invasion. Indeed, how does one approach those who sent soldiers to die
reclaiming Hegathe, and yet have virulently opposed us for decades?

The Forebears hold an inherited grudge over us due to our ancestors’ rule of
Yokuda and the civil war that once plagued this land, but to them I say this:
why did the Na-Totambu lead if they were not suited for the job?

I know that the Forebears, despite their politically misguided nature, are
Redguards like any Crown, but that does not change our differences on
fundamental presuppositions, namely: tradition versus modernity, staunch respect
for Yokudan heritage or openness to Tamrielic influence, who should rule, and
the list goes on. The question is where do we reconcile, and where do we hold
fast? I propose that we look to Yokuda for our example: we acknowledge where we
fall short, but remind them of where they do. The first Forebears to set foot on
this land were expert warriors, but why would they be here if the Na-Totambu had
not sent them? Who is to say that they even would’ve found Hammerfell on their
own? As I stated above, they are Redguards like us; but our ancestors were the
rulers and theirs the common men, and the differences between us explain why.
The old Yoku rulers gave monumental speeches to the masses; the Forebear
warriors who were in the service of the rulers spoke only by the whisper of
their blades through the air.

I say this, on the topic of pointing out the differences between us and them;
*don’t* put it to them in the terms of the great ruler over the poor peasant.
They don’t like that, just like it’s no great joy when some Forebear contrasts
the "oppressive emperor" with the good little common man. I try not to see
things in such terms, anyway; the Thalmor see all of us as poor peasants whom
they did the favor of giving a glimpse of their greatness in person when they
invaded our land and pillaged our cities. We want to point out simple historical
differences, not spark a second civil war.

It is my hope that this text will open eyes to the contrasts between we Crowns
and the Forebears, but also make any readers think twice before portraying the
ancestry of some great leader to our brothers by race.
