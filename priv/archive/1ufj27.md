Notes on the Bosmeri Alphabet
---

*By Harman Maurus*

Bosmeris is a language of infinite dialects, indeed they were counted at over a
thousand by Reman-era census-takers operating only within those tribes that
permitted them entry, and only with the most arrogant of approaches to the
language. However, in all (except for that of South-Guleld, who abhor the
written word, and the Jalken, who write only with abstract finger-paintings) a
more or less common [runic alphabet][0] can be identified.

Countless documents exist on [ancient elven alphabets][1], especially Dwemeris
and Ayleidoon, and in all of Bosmeris’ linguistic relatives, similarities can be
seen. Generally speaking, the alphabet is closest to that of the Ayleids,
perhaps unsurprising given the ancient link between those two neighbouring
races. However, the Bosmer typically forego the functionally stark characters of
their Heartland cousins, and in terms of form, their letters thus resemble the
ever-enigmatic Falmeris (indeed, much might be gained in the study of that lost
tongue were scholars less ready to turn their noses up at Bosmeri studies).

The elaborate serifs and decorations that differentiate Bosmeris so
significantly from Ayleidoon are, however, far from reliable. Their use and
appearance differs between tribes, dialects, and even individuals, and a habit
among record-keepers, transcribers and even readers to embellish or alter them
makes it almost impossible to keep track.

The relatively legible version of the Bosmeri alphabet included with this text
is the Anoclar Standardised Simple alphabet, designed by Anoclar Camoran,
following the above-mentioned census. The aim was to provide a standard,
readable, and accessible set of runes to facilitate communication across
Valenwood and between the Bosmer and their new Imperial masters.

The experiment was, naturally, an abject failure, with the Bosmer almost
unanimously rejecting the attempt at what they considered an inexcusable
dumbing-down (and “dulling-up” as the phrase goes) of their beloved language(s).
For their part, the Reman-era Cyrodiils were offended that Anoclar should
presume to insist upon communicating in Bosmeri script, whatever the form, and
found even his highly simplified version to be unpalatable.

The Anoclar alphabet, then, is useful only to scholars, as a useful stepping
stone to learning the enigmatic language of the Bosmer. While memorising the
proper formation of even this assembly of runes would be a time-consuming feat,
it pales to insignificance when compared with some of the more esoteric
dialects. Really anywhere beyond Valenwood’s largest cities, the most-used
alphabets will feature runes up to an inch across, each one embedded in a unique
(not to the one letter, but to its particular iteration in that particular
document) web of swirls and curlicues, giving manuscripts the (rather poetic)
appearance of a root-choked undergrowth.

Each tiny quirk is, amazingly, significant, even if only to its author.
Generally speaking, certain more common forms may be seen to alter pronunciation
or stress, combine or split vowels, conceptually link letters and words, denote
or even comprise footnotes and tangents, or perform any number of functions. We
should then, not be too harsh in our judgement of Anoclar’s alphabetic
experiments; the opportunity to communicate by writing with the Boiche (even if
one’s work may appear simplistic in the extreme) and to read original
manuscripts (albeit with difficulty) is one for which we should all be thankful.
