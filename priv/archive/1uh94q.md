The Aedra are spirits, a subset of the et’Ada. They are those spirits that gave
themselves to Mundus.[^1] I want to give an overview of the subdivisions of this
group of spirits. To do so, I will first examine their origin.

The et’Ada originated in the Beginning Place, they sprung up from the Interplay
of two opposing forces, most often called Anu and Padomay. The “first” spirit
was the Dragon also-known-as Aka, Time, and his existence allowed other spirits
to come into being. He is said to be the soul of Anuiel, which is the soul of
Anu[^2],[^3]. Whether this is literally the case or just a title of rulership
among the early spirits is unknown. However, the original Dragon was the most
Anuic of spirits and his opposite, Lorkhan, was the most Padomaic[^4].

The spirits were, at this point, not yet divided into Aedra, Daedra and Magne
Ge. They could, however, be categorized:

- Some spirits were anuic, others Padomaic[^5]
- Some of the et’Ada were aetherial, others dwelled in Oblivion[^6]
- Some of the et’Ada were “strong”, others less so[^7]

This last distinction is the most important. We have almost no reports from the
time before Mundus was created. This means that we know almost nothing about the
society of the Aedra and Magna Ge before they became Aedra and Magna Ge. I
assume that the organization of the spirits of Oblivion is not crucially
different from the organization of spirits in general before Mundus was created.
This may be a wrong assumption, since many of the spirits that would become the
Aedra were aetherial spirits. I will elaborate on this later. If we apply the
organization of Daedric society to all the Ada, we have several categories of
spirits:

- A ruling class of the Strong, part of which are the Princes of Oblivion. Other
  strong spirits are Arkay, Y’ffre and Magnus. As the first spirit, the Dragon
  was probably also part of this “class”[^8].
- Weaker, yet independent spirits. The only known example would be the
  Demiprince Fa-Nuit-Hen mentioned in the first Sermon of the 36 Lessons of
  Vivec[^9].

- The countless Lesser Ada organized in Clans[^10]. These are the Dremora,
  Matzken, Scamps, but also the Dragons[^11] and Jills, the Aurorans and
  Mnemoli. This category consists of numerous Ada given form and purpose by a
  shared collective identity, the Clan. They either bond with a Strong spirit in
  an Oath, or live independently.

- Special cases, spirits that are not independent, but do not belong to a Clan,
  i.e spirits that are still unique. Haskill[^12] is an example for this.

Just to reiterate, the subdivisions so far are Strong-Lesser; and among the
Lesser: Clanbound-Unique and Oathbound-Independent.

Let’s talk about spirit physiology for a bit. We know for sure that spirits[^13]
do[^14] not[^15] have[^16] one specific form[^17], but can rather take whatever
form they please. Talking about their bodily functions would be pointless,
except for the functions of the plane(t)s of the Strong. More on that
later[^18]. Let’s examine the components of the et’Ada, specifically the Strong
Spirits:

- A Sphere; Each Strong Spirit is the God of something, be it Time, Sex, Love,
  or Death. The equivalent for the Lesser spirits are

  1. the Oath, granting them part of a Strong Spirit’s sphere[^19], among other
     things[^7]; and
  1. the Clan, giving them purpose[^10].

- A Personality; The personalities of spirits are informed by their spheres, but
  distinct from them. Depending on their level of sentience, the Lesser Daedra
  may receive all of theirs from the Clan identity or have thoughts of their
  own. This is the Animus.

- A Body; A physical manifestation. Its form is arbitrary, but very likely to
  conform to the spirit’s sphere and character, or personal taste; Lesser Ada
  receive their form from their Clan.

- A Plane(t); This is what separates the Strong from the Lesser spirits.

The Strong spirits have these “special bodies”, manifestations of their power.
Realms, entire worlds unto themselves. According to the Monomyth, these realms
are “within” the respective Strong spirit. The Aurbis consists of nothing but
these realms, some of which were built to resemble the Void without the Aurbis.
This is the reason the Strong are important, they have plane(t)s for the weak to
dwell in; and spheres the Lesser Ada can align with.

The et’Ada lived divided into Strong and Weak, Clans and others for most of the
Untime of the Dawn. Then Lorkhan came along. He had an idea. He wanted to build
something new. Many spirits followed him, Strong spirits, their hosts of
servants and perhaps independent Clans, too. To find out what happened to all
these et’Ada, let us examine the structure of Mundus and then try to find out
which parts of which group of spirits went where.

Superficially, Mundus consists of Nirn, the Moons and the Eight. Now a little
more detailed:

- There are living Ada on Nirn. Morihaus is an example, Dragons are another.

- Most inhabitants of the Mundus, however, are mortal. This includes animals,
  plant-life and the sentient races.

- There is also inanimate matter on Nirn, e.g dirt, mud, water, stone and ebony.

- Mortal beings have souls. These had to come from somewhere.

- Nirn is governed by laws of nature. These are called Earthbones. One of them
  is the Heartbone.

- Nirn has a beating Heart. It deserves special mention.

Let’s find out which part of which Aedroth went where; there are four groups of
Aedra:

- Eight Aedra ~~Eat the Dreamer~~ withheld enough power to still remain
  plane(t)s independent from Nirn. They are the strongest of the Aedra, although
  they are not necessarily the strongest of the Strong spirits that followed
  Lorkhan. The Eight are “dead”, they asleep or comatose or whatever else you
  want to call spirits that once were active and powerful but are no longer. Of
  all the (regular) Aedra, the Eight are the most alive.

- Other et’Ada became the progenitors of the mortal races. They had children and
  died, because they had children. Or they noticed that they were dying and made
  offspring to “survive” in some way, if impersonally. Their divine souls split
  and became the souls of mortals. Species and races of mortals are the
  equivalent of the Clans of the Ada. The souls of mortals are pieces of the
  Animi of their spirit ancestors. This is creation, the splitting of the divine
  into the mortal. The Dwemeri practice of anti-creation is the reverse,
  building the divine by killing the mortal. Numidium is the racial God of the
  Dwemer, its Animus the sum of their souls; it is their Clan identity given
  physical form.

- Some of the Ada died even more completely. They became the Eartbones, the laws
  of nature. Y’ffre is called the “First Earthbone”, he is the strongest spirit
  to suffer this fate. Y’ffre’s sphere became, among other things, the forms of
  the Bosmer and the laws of the Green Pact. The Green Pact itself is an Oath
  bond – the Strong spirit Y’ffre grants the Bosmer a part of his sphere in
  exchange for servitude. All the inanimate matter of Nirn was once part of the
  bodies of Ada. Nirn is made of corpses.

- The last category is special. There is only one example. Lorkhan, who died
  even more thoroughly than the Earthbones. His heart was ripped out, his body
  became the dead Moons and he was torn asunder. This does _not_ refer to him
  being split into the Moons. The Moons were once white, _alive_. Lorkhan had
  two plane(t)s when he lived. His body _was_ torn asunder, his Heart became an
  Earthbone, his planes the moons, who knows where other parts went and his
  Animus, too, was torn apart. This is what makes him especially special. As
  outlined above, the souls of mortals are the Animi of their divine ancestors.
  The Animi of the Earthbones are defunct. Their fates are various. The Eight
  retain their Animi. They still have their own souls and personalities.
  Although these are warped by mortal belief and “asleep”, they are still whole.
  Except Aka. Aka’s Animus/mind is all over the place. And we all know Lorkhan’s
  Animus. We get to as it. Lorkhan’s Animus was torn into pieces. When these
  pieces are born into mortal men we call the resulting person Shezzarine.

Now, some remaining questions:

## What are avatars?

An avatar is a physical manifestation of a Strong spirit. What we see of
Sheogorath and Jygallag in the Shivering Isles storyline are avatars. The
Sheogorath we meet in Skyrim is an avatar. So [are][0] [these][1] [guys][2].

## What are dragons?

Lesser Ada that survived on Nirn. They share thoughts and form, both given by
their Clan and their allegiance to the Dragon.

## What is Morihaus?

A lesser Ada, surviving trough much of history. He was Oathbound to Kyne. It is
unknown wether he was unique or the last surviving member of his Clan.

## You got sources for all of that?

Yep, here:
