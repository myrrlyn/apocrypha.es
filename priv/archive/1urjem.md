> *26^th^ of First Seed 3E277*
>
> *Something bizarre occured today. As per usual on Morndas, Angeir brought in*
> *the evening’s selection. Today he had bagged a nice, big Orsimer, a rare*
> *delicacy around these parts. My, how large and muscular he was, those biceps*
> *were practically screaming at me, begging for me to roast them up and devour*
> *them. Every line and curvature carved by that exquisite form only served to*
> *entice me further. This was set to be quite the evening.*
>
> *We laid the beautiful creature across the altar, and recited our opening*
> *prayers to our great lady. Only our lord could truly bless us with such a*
> *feast. It was my turn to cut the throat, and I was delighted to do so. The*
> *prayers ceased, and I drew the ceremonial knife. As I slowly brought it to*
> *the hideous beauty’s jugular, savoring every moment, the most peculiar thing*
> *occurred. He opened his eyes.*
>
> *“Angeir, didn’t you administer the sleep spell? We can’t risk people waking*
> *up like this, especially a hulk such as this one!”*
>
> *“I did, I swear! At least, I think I did. Uh, how did it go aga—”*
>
> *Before he finished stammering his pathetic excuse, the beast sprang from the*
> *altar and pounced on Angeir. The Orc wrapped his brutish mitts around the*
> *Nord’s throat, who then began to scream like a child, begging for his life.*
> *Such weakness was not expected from a “mighty son of Skyrim”, especially one*
> *from our cabal. What a pity. I’m losing track, anyway, the monster had*
> *Angeir in a chokehold, but did not seem to be choking him. He was*
> *restraining him, not assaulting him.*
>
> *A solemn expression crossed the Orc’s face, and he released Angeir. “Um, I*
> *am sorry. Sometimes I get angry. Teacher says anger is a waste of time in*
> *the search for Love.” He glanced around, obviously confused. “Where… am I?”*
>
> *Like always, Ganril (despicable Altmer, bah) was the first to speak. “You,*
> *dear child, are in our sanctuary. You were, uh, rescued, by Angeir here.” He*
> *gestured towards the Nord, and winked at the rest of us. “You were in peril,*
> *great peril, and we have brought you here for safety. You are obviously*
> *stressed, come, lie down for a spell.”*
>
> *The Orc took a step back. “No, you are no helpers. You are followers of, um,*
> *Nam, uh, Namira, yes that’s the one!” Terror overtook his face, “You were*
> *going to eat me!”*
>
> *Before Ganril attempted to charm the thug into a more distressed state, I*
> *stepped forward. “Yes, you are right, we had plans to eat you. But, you, oh,*
> *you are different. None before have resisted us. You are either one of two*
> *things. You are either a great warrior who far outmatches us that we have no*
> *business engaging, or you could be a sign from our foul Namira, blessed be*
> *her most vile of names.”*
>
> *An appearance of deep contemplation overtook the Orc. “I was once a warrior,*
> *and I have never been a chosen of a Daedra. Now I am a student and a*
> *teacher, I wish to share my knowledge, so we may all know the truth.”*
>
> *A few snickers came from our congregation, myself included. “Alright, uh,*
> *Orc, tell us your teachings.” The giggling heightened.*
>
> *He looked excited, and then went back to thinking. “My name is not Orc, I am*
> *Mort. How do I start? Well, let me start with one of the first things*
> *Teacher taught me,” he pointed at me, “who are you?”*
>
> *I shot a sly look to the group, they seemed as interested as I was, though*
> *less suspicious. “Well, Mort, I shall hear you out. I am Ralfar Henim,*
> *esteemed pustulence of Namira.”*
>
> *“Hello Ralfar. Where do you live?”*
>
> *“I would rather not disclose my address. All you may know is I live here in*
> *Cyrodiil.”*
>
> *“No, be less literal.” He placed a finger on his forehead. “You live here.*
> *Well, not my head, you live in Ralfar’s head.”*
>
> *I was taken aback, I did not expect this mongrel to get so philosophical. “I*
> *see what you are getting at,” I mimed his motion, “the only thing I know for*
> *certain is my own mind. Everything around me is all merely perceptions, this*
> *sanctuary, and all of you people, could be mere illusions. All I know is I*
> *am real, you may not be real.”*
>
> *“And I have the same truths. To me, Mort is real, and Ralfar could be an*
> *illusion. I only perceive you, and, in a way, I also perceive characters in*
> *fiction. The universe could be one single point that I only perceive as*
> *sprawling country and vast oceans, and I would never know. All I know is me.*
> *To me, you may not exist. But to you, you definitely exist, and I may be the*
> *illusion. How is this?”*
>
> *“That could be exactly what an illusion would say. I admit, your*
> *intelligence impresses me, but you have proved nothing. An illusion could*
> *say all the things you have.”*
>
> *“Maybe I should try something else. Oh, oh, what are you?”*
>
> *“A Dunmer? A follower of Namira? That is far too general a question.”*
>
> *“No, think wider. Go less specific.”*
>
> *“I am a person.” He motioned me to go on. “An organism? A thing?”*
>
> *“Good, you have proved that everything can be generalized. Now, go one step*
> *further, what is beyond being ‘a thing’? How can you be more general?”*
>
> *I thought for a while, and was rather embarrassed to admit that I had no*
> *answer. “I do not know, what could it be?”*
>
> *An oafish grin erupted upon the Orc. “Nothing! Like all Dunmers are part of*
> *the Dunmer race, and all people are part of the people, uh people, all*
> *things are unified under Nothing. We, as things, are Nothing. We do not*
> *exist. But, in our minds, we are the only things that exist. We are, yet we*
> *are not. This is The Lie.”*
>
> *The idea struck me as oddly profound. I am, yet I am not. The others began*
> *to laugh, and shouted crass catcalls at Mort.*
>
> *“I don’t exist, that’s the most absurd thing I have ever heard!”*
>
> *“Too busy getting your precious Orsinium sacked to have any real ideas?”*
>
> *“I’m the real fool here, I expected an Orc to say something intelligent!”*
> *That was Ganril, such a typical Altmer.*
>
> *I felt bad for the poor Orc. We reviled of Namira are the most putrid beings*
> *in Tamriel, how can we judge this man? I approached Mort and whispered to*
> *him. “Mort, you have spoken wise things to me, thank you. I suggest you run*
> *now, before these brutes eat you. They cannot be difficult to shove aside.*
> *Go.”*
>
> *I sha’n’t ever forget the look in that man’s eyes. He took my gaze for but a*
> *mere moment before breaking into a dead sprint for the exit. And what speed*
> *he had! Without taking any notice, he plowed straight through Ganril and a*
> *few others. Within a blink of the eye, he was gone. The cult began to*
> *murmur, such athleticism was almost unreal. A few chased after him. They*
> *returned an hour ago, unable to find him.*
>
> *I cannot get his words out of my head. He clearly had more to say, and more*
> *to learn from his teacher. I love this brotherhood, and I love our vile*
> *maiden, but where is this getting me? Perhaps I shall search for Mort,*
> *wherever he may be. Odds are, I will have to leave this sanctuary soon*
> *anyway, this incident has left me as the laughing stock of the whole group.*
> *I shall pack my things tonight, and depart during the darkest hour. Farewell*
> *Ganril, I always hated you.*
>
> *—Ralfar Henim*
