> *27th of Rain’s Hand, 3E279*
>
> *I did it. By Shor, I found him. Had that damned cult not been offering such*
> *a hefty sum for this man’s head, I would not have spent these past two*
> *months scouring all of The Reach. The target had flown east, all the way to*
> *Jehanna. Never before have I traveled so far for one contract, and I’m not*
> *sure I ever shall again.*
>
> *By The Nine, look at me, can I still call myself an honest man? Here I am,*
> *embarking on some despicable journey just to take the life of some man who*
> *has never wronged me, a man I have never even met. And why? For money. I*
> *never listened to my father, I wasted all my money on booze and women, and*
> *gambled away the money I didn’t have. I cannot even find work in The*
> *Fighters’ Guild, or The Companions, they both tell me I have no honor and no*
> *right to call myself a warrior. I cannot deny that I agree. My family thinks*
> *I’m off guarding some merchant caravan. They don’t know. They don’t know*
> *that I have reduced myself to some crude assassin. My brother knew. I’m so*
> *sorry, Alorn, may you find eternal honor in Sovngarde. I know I won’t.*
>
> *I arrived in Jehanna three days ago, and could find no trace of my target.*
> *There I go, using that word again. “Target”, what a way to dehumanize*
> *someone. He was most likely using an alias, the employers profiled him as*
> *extremely intelligent, he would not be making any dumb mistakes.*
>
> *I received the fateful clue at the tavern yesterday. Two women behind me*
> *were having a discussion, and I could not help but overhear.*
>
> *“Have you seen that horrid Dark Elf fellow that recently arrived?”*
>
> *“Seen him? I smelled him far before I first saw him. That man reeks of*
> *something worse than death.”*
>
> *“Well, that’s what happens when you come from a land covered in dust and*
> *Daedra. Bah, what a horrid people. Just what does Anton think he is doing by*
> *letting him stay in that inn? He is going to ruin his own reputation.”*
>
> *I asked around about this Anton, he runs The Smiling Suthay Inn. Anton*
> *himself put his wallet before his morals, it was not difficult to get the*
> *information I needed. He went so far as to give the number of the room my*
> *target was staying in. I don’t understand how people could be comfortable*
> *sleeping in an inn run by this cretin.*
>
> *My journeys had taught me a bit about the way of the lock, and, after a few*
> *minutes, I was inside. The target was not there, but that was*
> *understandable, the sun had only just begun to set. I set my things down,*
> *and resolved to wait for him to return. The next sequence of events was not*
> *at all what I had expected.*
>
> *About three hours after entering the room, I heard footsteps outside. I*
> *readied myself with my shoulder forward and my other hand on my sword. The*
> *door opened, and, in one swift motion, I slammed it shut and shoved him*
> *against the wall. Two violently crimson eyes stared back at me. I had my*
> *man.*
>
> *“Ralfar Henim, I do apologize, but you are wanted for dead. May you find*
> *peace in Sovngarde, or Oblivion, or whatever it is you Dunmer go.”*
>
> *Before I could draw my sword, a bizarre pain shot through my right leg. In*
> *reaction, my gaze shot to the source, where I saw his hand burning brightly*
> *against my thigh. In my distraction, he pushed me back, and, with my leg*
> *unable to bear my weight from the searing pain, I fell flat on my back. I*
> *lay motionless, and accepted my fate. Bested by a Dunmer. I guess I never*
> *really was a Nord.*
>
> *“I see no sadness in your eyes, Nord. Have you no family that will miss you?*
> *Have you no passions that will be left incomplete?”*
>
> *“I have a family, but they will not miss me. I have passions, but they are*
> *unbecoming of a warrior. My life has been characterized by debauchery and*
> *unfaithfulness, death comes as a mercy. End me, before I shame myself*
> *further.”*
>
> *“Get up, I have no interest in killing you. I have not killed anyone in*
> *quite a while, and I intend to make a habit of that.” He took my hand and*
> *pulled me to my feet. “I apologize for your leg, that should not leave much*
> *of a wound. I had to, otherwise you would have killed me. Now, tell me,*
> *Nord, why so glum? Even if you mean nothing to anybody else, don’t you love*
> *yourself?”*
>
> *“What have I to love? I sold my honor for alcohol and other carnal*
> *pleasures. I am no man, I am a monster. Why do you not kill me? I assaulted*
> *you, I am an enemy.”*
>
> *“If I killed you, you would fail. You could be the one to succeed, and*
> *killing you would deprive this world of its chosen successor.”*
>
> *“Your words elude me. Speak plainly, Dark Elf.”*
>
> *“Right, I sometimes have trouble speaking to Believers. All of us live our*
> *so-called “lives” for one reason, to make something of ourselves. This world*
> *is empty and devoid of meaning, when we die, we vanish into nothingness,*
> *hardly different from living. Think of the millions of people who have died*
> *before today, think of just how few you knew. Nobody is remembered, and*
> *nobody matters. However, the goal is to matter. All of us are equal in*
> *Nothing, so one must step outside of Nothing to matter. However, what could*
> *be beyond that Nothing?”*
>
> *“I do not think anything can be beyond it, isn’t that what makes it*
> *“nothing”? Your philosophy is wasted on me, it is better you leave me be.”*
>
> *“These teachings are wasted on nobody, for it is anyone who may pass The*
> *Test. Now, that Nothing is infinite, so how may one pass through infinity?”*
> *He reached into a satchel he was wearing, and removed a wooden sphere that*
> *fit right in the palm of his hand. “This is an infinity.”*
>
> *“No, that is a ball. It is not endless, I can see the entirety of it right*
> *in front of me.”*
>
> *“Can you? Can you see the side opposite from you? For all you know, this*
> *object is endless. No matter how you orient yourself, you will never see*
> *this whole sphere at once, you will have to move.” He placed a finger at the*
> *object’s equator, and slowly traced a circle around it. “Once you reach the*
> *opposite side, you can no longer see the side you witnessed before. How do*
> *you know that side is still as you saw it? Think of a river, the water flows*
> *constantly. You may step in the river on Morndas, but on Tirdas, that will*
> *not be the same river. The water you stepped in on Morndas will have moved*
> *away, and new water will have taken its place. No man steps in the same*
> *river twice. And, if all things are united under Nothing, why should this*
> *sphere be any different? You can never reach the same point again by going*
> *continuously in one direction, despite what you have been told. This is The*
> *Lie.”*
>
> *I took the sphere from him, and examined it. “I… think I understand, maybe.”*
>
> *“The Nothing is as infinite as that sphere. Look beyond the Nothing,*
> *perceive The Lie, and there will you find meaning. Now, I doubt you are the*
> *only one they sent after me, I really must be going. Remember what I told*
> *you, live for that meaning. Again, I apologize for your leg, that should*
> *heal up fine. Goodbye, Nord, may you see The Lie wherever you go.” He caught*
> *himself at the door. “I never did get your name.”*
>
> *“Soren. Soren Jurgikssen.” I had not heard my own name for a long time. It*
> *sounded foreign, like some alien language.*
>
> *“Farewell, Soren. Find that meaning.”*
>
> *And now I sit, alone, I have not left this room since that encounter. My leg*
> *has healed, like he said, but my mind feels like it has been beaten*
> *savagely. I have this damned sphere before me as I write. How is this simple*
> *wooden object infinite? It’s just a simple ball! And now I cannot stop*
> *trying to see it as infinite, I cannot stop trying to see it as what it is*
> *not. Perhaps he was right. I do not know. Perhaps I am unable to know. But*
> *one thing is clear to me: I have much to learn about this world before I lay*
> *down and rest. And I intend to do just that.*
>
> *—Soren Jurgikssen*
