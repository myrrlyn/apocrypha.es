## Preliminary Notes

The Council was convened in the physical at the insistence of Synod Zeroth
Attendant Morroiel, who cited as justification “mnemetic intolerance”, “unduly
partial sleeve-tracts” and eventually “a desire to see in person the shame-faced
collapse of the College of Whispers”.

While the Council was initially planned to take place in the Arcane University,
this was vetoed by His Cyrodiilic Lordship the Count of Nu Corrup ^All the Gods^
^be with Him^, who preferred not to travel on account of chronic magicka burn to
the inner thigh. As such the Council was hosted in the Nu Corrup Synod House.

While Table votes, voted on only by the Tableman and Eight Seatmen, will be
recorded on a full NAY/AYE/ABSTAIN basis, for concision’s sake, House votes,
voted on by the Tableman and Seatmen and by all Voting Representatives, will be
recorded only by their final outcome. For detailed breakdowns of the voting,
please refer to the relevant archive documents.

## Absences and Substitutions

Her Cyrodiilic Majesty and Imperial Splendour the Empress Morihatha II Mede,
Blessed of Heaven, Empress, and Mother and Daughter of Emperors, Inspiration of
Faith and Safeguard of Justice ^All the Gods be with Her^ intended initially to
dispatch Her Cyrodiilic Majesty and Imperial Splendour’s Imperial Battlemage,
\[REDACTED\] as Imperial Nuncio to the Council, but in the unfortunate event of
said Battlemage’s non-existence, the Nunciate was transferred to his Nibenean
Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup.

Grand Arch-Moff Sussuro Moslin of the College of Whispers was invited as Second
Seatman to the Council, but was, on account of his suicide, unable to attend. As
a result, the Second Seat of the Council was conferred upon the
Moderate-and-acting-Grand Arch-Moff instead.

Following the first recess of the Council, Zeroth Attendant Morroiel was absent.

## Minutes of the Council

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ First Seatman, Second Seatman, Third
Seatman, Fourth Seatman, Fifth Seatman, Sixth Seatman, Seventh Seatman, Eighth
Seatman, tow-hundred-and-eight— ahem, two-hundred-and-nine Voting
Representatives, thirty-six Witless Spectators, We welcome you to this First
Ecumagickal Council of the Fourth Era, and to the Synod House of Nu Corrup.

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Hear, hear!

_First Attendant of the Synod, Lysanna Montrose ^4th^:_ Hear, hear!

_First Attendant of the Synod, Albero Sul ^5th^:_ Hear, hear… hear.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Thank you First Seatman, Fourth
Seatman, and Fifth Seatman, now—

_First Attendant of the Synod, Albero Sul ^5th^:_ Hear, hear!

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Ahem. Now on to — ah, thank you Fifth
Seatman — on to business.

The primary order of, uh, of business, is to be the assessment, reassessment,
and reallocation of those spell functions and Magnal principles not already
re-allocated and considered until Her Cyrodiilic Majesty and Imperial
Splendour’s Ecumagickal Decree of the First of Rain’s Hand, Fourth Era
Eighty-Seven. Per the aforementioned Decree, aforementioned spell functions and
Magnal principles are to be re-categorised, assessed, reassessed and reallocated
into one of the remaining five Schools of Magic, those Schools being as follows:

The School of Alteration, the School of Conjuration, the School of Destruction,
the School of Illusion and uh, the School of… the School of Restoration.

_Little Moff of the College of Whispers, Agvo Jerich ^6th^:_ A perfectly valid
School!

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Indeed, thank you Sixth Seatman.

Now, before entering onto aforementioned first order of business, let us share
in the Nine Invocations: Come to me, Akatosh, come to me, Talos, come to me
Julianos, come to me Kynareth, come to me, Zenithar, come to me, come to me,
Stendarr, come to me, Mara, come to me, Dibella, come to me, Arkay. Et Ceterous
exaltations and praises unto the gods.

Now, to the first order of business — the assessment. We have here in our hand,
a list of those spell functions and Magnal principles pertinent to
aforementioned assessment. Let us begin, with item the first, soul trapping, and
extra-liminal exclusion. Who will speak first?

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ I will speak first.

_Margo Ablutius ^8th^:_ Surprise…

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Soul trapping and
transliminal exclusion deal ultimately with the manipulation of the limen, and
with the traffic of souls. As such—

_Moderate-and-acting-Grand Arch-Moff of the College of Whispers, Sussuro Losmin_
_^2nd^:_ Objection! Soul trapping by its very definition deals with the _lack_
of traffic of souls.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Thank you Second Seatman, please hold
all objections until the end of the First Seatman’s given speaking time. Eighth
Seatman, the same goes for sarcastic interjections.

_Margo Ablutius ^8th^:_ Objection, it isn’t an interjection if it only comes
after.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Indeed, in which case We move for a
Table ban on sarcastic interjections. Vote.

## Aye

1^st^, 2^nd^, 4^th^, 5^th^, 6^th^, 7^th^, Table

## Nay

8^th^

## Abstain

3^rd^

## AYE

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ The motion carries, sarcastic
interjections to be banned. Who was speaking?

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ I was speaking, Soul—

_Margo Ablutius ^8th^:_ \[REDACTED\]

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Eighth Seatman, sarcastic interjections
have been banned by this Table… cover your ears for… a while. Secretary,
redact Eighth Seatman’s comment. First Seatman?

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Ahem. Soul trapping and
transliminal exclusion deal ultimately with the manipulation of the limen, and
with the traffic of souls. As such, they fall within the purview of the School
of Conjuration, alongside transliminal inclusions, penetrations, irrelevancies,
and other such related interactions. Furthermore, summoning spells, the
transliminal movement of souls, is classified uncontestedly under the School of
Conjuration, ergo soul trapping, the _prevention_ of the transliminal movement
of souls, must likewise be classified under said school.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Objections?

_Moderate-and-acting-Grand Arch-Moff of the College of Whispers, Sussuro Losmin_
_^2nd^:_ I have. As I said, Soul trapping deals with the _lack_ of traffic of
souls. Surely if it is, as the Synod posits, the opposite of summoning, it can
by no means occupy the same school.

_First Attendant of the Synod, Lysanna Montrose ^4th^:_ If the School of
Restoration may hold spells both to rejuvenate and to tire, surely Conjuration
may hold spells both to promote and to prevent the transliminal passage of
souls.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Let’s keep this moving, we move for a
House vote, proposition, “soul trapping and transliminal exclusion be moved to
the School of Conjuration”.

## AYE

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Motion carries. Next, dispels and
wards. Who will speak first?

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ I—

_Moderate-and-acting-Grand Arch-Moff of the College of Whispers, Sussuro Losmin_
_^2nd^:_ _I_ will speak first. Dispels and wards deal with the effects of
spells and of magicka in general upon the body. As such, I propose that it be
moved to the School of Restoration.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Any objections?

_Little Moff of the College of Whispers, Agvo Jerich ^6th^:_ Objection! I… no,
no objection.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Hmm. A House vote then. The motion
“Dispels and wards be moved to the School of Restoration”.

## AYE

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Next… magicka reflection and spell
absorption. Who will speak?

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ I will speak first

_Margo Ablutius ^8th^:_ \[REDACTED\]

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Secretary, redact. Continue, First
Seatman.

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Reflection and
absorption can only be placed in my school of Alteration. Per the Farano
Treatise, reflection and absorption spells find their foundation in manipulation
of the skin’s physical properties. Indeed Farano’s test subjects exhibited
reactions only when their skin or clothing was exposed to aetheric—

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ First Seatman, I am sure the esteemed
Seatmen of this Council are familiar with the relevant texts; let us not get
bogged down in academic details. Please. Any objections?

_Margo Ablutius ^8th^:_ I have an objection, Attendant—

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Eighth Seatman, speaking in turn I see?

_Margo Ablutius ^8th^:_ Secretary, redact? No? Table vote? No? Fine. As I was
saying, Attendant Morroiel said what feels like mere lengthy, mind-numbing hours
ago that dispels and wards, affecting, as they do, the effects of magicka on the
body—

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Objection!

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Regretfully overruled

_Margo Ablutius ^8th^:_ —should be classified under the School of Restoration.
Surely, then, the same must hold true for reflection and absorption? Affecting,
as it does, the effect of magicka on the body.

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Objection, Magister
Ablutius’ quote is from the mouth of Moff Losmin, not of my own. It is therefore
entirely irrelevant.

_Moderate-and-acting-Grand Arch-Moff of the College of Whispers, Sussuro Losmin_
_^2nd^:_ Objection! The reasoning stands. Reflection and absorption belong
under Restoration.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Ugh, House vote. Proposition, “magicka
reflection and spell absorption be moved to the School of Restoration”.

## NAY

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Very well… Proposition, “magicka
reflection and spell absorption be moved to the School of Alteration”.

## AYE

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Motion carries. Next… telekinesis,
magickinesis, aetheric fulcrums et cetera. Who will speak first?

_First Attendant of the Synod, Albero Sul ^5th^:_ I will. Table vote that this
council recess for victuals.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Fifth Seatman, the hour is barely past
two, and this council was preceded by a banquet… Very well…

## Aye

4^th^, 5^th^, 7^th^, 8^th^

## Nay

1^st^, 2^nd^, 4^th^, 6^th^, Table,

## Abstain

3^rd^

## NAY

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Motion fails, mercifully. Telekinesis,
et cetera?

_Little Moff of the College of Whispers, Agvo Jerich ^6th^:_ Telekinesis et
cetera belong in the School of Illusion. Per Athi’s Law of Magickal Fulcra, the
essential is to trick one’s own mind into assuming new properties. It is absurd
to suggest that in actual fact the mortal mind can naturally exert force upon
outside physical objects is preposterous, as the mind, per _Carstein’s_ Law can
exert no pressure beyond itself except through via tones and wave
magnifications. Telekinesis consists primarily of an illusion persuading one’s
own mind that this is not the case.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Object—

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Moff Jerich you forget
yourself, Athi’s Law was discredited unanimously by Synod earlier this year in
the Montrose Papers—

_First Attendant of the Synod, Lysanna Montrose ^4th^:_ Hmm?

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Moff Jerich you forget
yourself, Athi’s Law was discredited unanimously by Synod earlier this year in
the Montrose Papers, stamped by \[REDACTED\] himself. Once again the College of
Whispers reveals its fixation with archaic principles.

_First Attendant of the Synod, Lysanna Montrose ^4th^:_ Hear, hear.

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Rather, telekinesis and
magickal fulcra, manipulations of the Mundrial by the magickal, belong in the
School of Alteration. After all—

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ House vote. To Alteration with it?

## AYE

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Carries. Sensory magnifications, wave
reception and drum-dowsing. Who will speak?

_His Eminence the Primate of Julianos, Kantus Astav ^3rd^:_ I will speak first.
The School of Julianos prefers that all such “life detection” and wave-function
magicks be placed under the School of Alteration for the time being, pursuant to
a proper review and assessment by the School’s own analysts. It is our feeling
that so called “drum-dowsing” as a practise is in need of review.

_Margo Ablutius ^8th^:_ Objection, I doubt his Eminence will be paid in full if
he insists on deviating from Synod agendas.

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Objection! This
organisation would never stoop so low as to — what of the Whisperers? Did they
not—

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Thank you Third Seatman. Eighth
Seatman, We will thank you to refrain from libellous remarks for the duration of
this Council.

_Margo Ablutius ^8th^:_ Table vote?

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Veto. Third Seatman, anything beyond
the immediate reclassification of the relevant spells falls beyond the purview
of this council. We recommend that the School submit in timely fashion a
petition for Her Cyrodiilic Majesty and Imperial Splendour’s authority to the
Elder Council by memospore for a more appropriate forum. Aside from that,
objections to the Alteration School?

_Little Moff of the College of Whispers, Agvo Jerich ^6th^:_ How in
\[REDACTED\] can any of the aforementioned be called alterations of the Mundrial
by means magickal? Life detection alters nothing in the Mundrial beyond the
caster’s own body. Per the Caranya Paper of—

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Objection! Master Wizard
Caranya was disgraced and posthumously excommunicated from the Mages’ Guild in—

_Little Moff of the College of Whispers, Agvo Jerich ^6th^:_ You’re talking out
of your \[REDACTED\] you puffed up, stuff-robed charlatan, you wouldn’t know a
\[REDACTED\] you can’t \[REDACTED\] and even then, it was only thanks to
\[REDACTED\] right up your \[REDACTED\]. The academic principle remains, and all
the spell functions in this grouping belong to Restoration, they are
modifications of the body’s natural senses, and as such, you can take your
Alteration and \[REDACTED\].

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Ahem… thank you… Sixth Seatman… We
would thank you to refrain from awakening repressed memories through obscenity
for the duration… Shall we put it to a House vote? Proposition, “sensory
magnifications, wave reception and drum-dowsing be moved to the School of
Alteration”.

## AYE

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Passes.

_Little Moff of the College of Whispers, Agvo Jerich ^6th^:_ Objection!

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Overruled.

_Keeper of the Vigil of Stendarr, Randull Red-Beard (7th^:_ Recommend that this
Council be recessed, and that First and Sixth take their disagreements to the
courtyard.

_Zeroth Attendant of the Synod, Jurus Morroiel ^1st^:_ Objection!

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Overruled. Table vote.

## Aye

2^nd^, 6^th^, 7^th^, 8^th^

## Nay

1^st^, 4^th^, 5^th^

## Abstain

3^rd^, Table

## AYE

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Vote carries. Reconvene in…

_Little Moff of the College of Whispers, Agvo Jerich ^6th^:_ An hour.

_His Nibean Lordship the Count of Nu-Corrup, Elder Councillor Pavo Bincal_
_^All the Gods be with Him (Tableman)^:_ Reconvene in an hour. We are required
to thank all attendees at the Table.
