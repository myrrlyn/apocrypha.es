28th of Sun’s Height, 57th Year of the Third Era

For four days and nights a storm with the will of The HoonDing assaulted my
fleet, by the sweet songs of Tava we survived the maelstrom, though not
unharmed. The fleet lost the Alik’r Mistress and we believe we have been pushed
a hundred Numidials[^1] off course. The sun sets on the far shores and I begin to
drift off to sleep for the first time in days.

I begin to dream and the twinkle in the eye of my trespasser grows into a bright
light, there I stand before the mer, the dream so real I can smell the red dirt
at my feet.

> “What is your name son of the red dirt desert of the North?”

My name is Nosam of Sentinal, son of Malik the Scorpian, Captain of the Shehai
sword and who are you Mer?

> “My name is Shinji-El-Who-Sits-And-Waits-Beneath-The-Sword-of-Dusk-and-Dawn,
> Son of Auri-El the High King, High-Sitter of the 11 Kingdoms of the
> Balmer[^2].”

Balmer? High-Sitter? None of this makes sense to me mer, where do you hail from?

> “Nosam of the Red Dirt… I hail from your homeland the motherland of Balmereth,
> I am the lord of The Empire of the Balmer, I am the Left-Hand of Stone
> unweathered in the winds of Tava.”

So you are a Left-Hander? I should cast you down where you sit for such sorcery
you warlock!

> “Easy, Nosam you have come to find me for a reason and I intend to tell you my
> story, the story untold by your ancestors for many a eon.”

Go on with it Mer I don’t like the scheming of your kind and wish to be rid of
it as soon as possible.

> “Very well then Nosam of the Red Dirt we will start at the beginning, many
> eons ago in the era of Aldmeris there was a schism in ideals in the mers
> earliest ancestors. My brothers and I had a great disagreement in the beliefs
> of our father Auri-El the highest of high. The Dwemer hated the ubsurdity of
> worshiping any of our ancestors believing them no better than us and the
> Maormer of brother Orgnum came under the influence of the immortal sea snakes
> honey-like words. When the Thalmor declared the world a blastphemy the schism
> came between our people and those of the Altmer. I lead my people into the
> west in search of a new homeland to follow the true path of father Auri-El who
> regrets his murder of the King Lorkhan.”
>
> “The new land and new name of our people came to be known as Balmereth, the
> land of Stone-Folk, venerating the dracochrysalis of our lord Auri-El and the
> unweathering Crystal-Like-Law. The sands of the The Far Shores permeate all of
> our being. You and I both are at the smallest level made of the Sands the
> Atomos. One day as you have seen I will form my sands into a brillant crystal
> the the Far Shores could be proud of to show my people the way of the Wait.
> Nosam of the Red Dirt at one time our people went hand in hand in the streets
> in a Kingdom as glorious as any in history.”
