Hello all,

In this post, I’m going to attempt to tackle the [Magne-Ge Pantheon][0], and its
potential interpretations within the [AkaLorkh = Spacetime][1] framework. This
is quite long, so bear with me.

## A few preliminary comments

**CMYKBlend Signs**: These are clearly a direct reference to the [subtractive
colors][2]. I strongly suspect that the Blend Sign acts as the admixing
action-frequency. In our universe, for example, purple does not have a single
wavelength associated with it: a cyan-magenta-blend would be required to
represent it, and your brain makes up the resulting averaged color you see. This
is most likely why the Blends are distinct and “on the rise”. Additionally, the
context and nomenclature strongly remind me of the [standard stellar spectral
classification][3] in Astrophysics, which relates a star’s visible color to its
surface temperature.

**Dualities**: We can think of Mundus and Aetherius as being equivalent and
symmetric, with all the information of one side giving us all the information on
the other side, albeit in a scrambled or 'rotated' form. The remnants of the
Magne-Ge are the light filtering in from Aetherius through the white holes
ripped at the boundary event horizon. See my [previous post][4] and this
[comment thread][5] for more details.

**Redshift**: In our universe, redshifting comes from three main sources:

- [(Relativistic)][6] [Motion][7] (the Aurbic dance of precession, orbit, and
  spinning)
- [Gravity][8] (embodied by Y’ffre’s Mass Earthbone on Nirn)

- [Spacetime][9] itself (embodied by AkaLorkh)

Redshifting entails decreasing all frequencies towards the red side of the light
spectrum, or towards the lower notes of the musical scale. Within a quantum
theory, a redshifted wave has less energy, but this probably best left to
another post. Blueshifting is the opposite notion.

## Implications

The CMYKs can be associated with distinct spectral [eigenfrequencies][10]; that
is to say, they each have their own [unique, color signature][11]. Thus, we can
think of them as the Discrete/Digital components of Color: every other Color we
can ever achieve can be obtained by Blending them appropriately. The Magne-Ge
can then be thought of the [quantized, resonant frequencies of the Dreamer’s
mind][12].

The et’Ada are the Analogs compositions of Color in Mundus[^1]: their spectral
frequencies can be explained in terms of combinations of the Magne-Ge. However,
by the duality of Aetherius and Mundus, we can think of the Magne-Ge as composed
of et’Ada: they are both equivalent [eigenbases][13]. Mathematically, we can
describe how to go from the Magne-Ge to the et’Ada through a [Fourier
Transform][14], which decomposes a wave into its constituents. As above, so
below – as within, so without.

Furthermore, I’d like to propose a revision to /u/myrrlyn’s [Musical, Colorful
Aurbis][15] post: the colors and Hue angles would be represented by some
appropriate, correlated, combination of the Magna-Ge (one of the conjectures
below outlines this). In fact, as would be expected from a synesthetic
viewpoint, we could expect the et’Ada and Magna-Ge to fuse and mix; this is also
further expounded in some of the conjectures. As a final note, the original
[Aurbis: The Musical][16] post’s comments on Lorkhan’s involvement with the
Rhythm/Time can be neatly explained by the AkaLorkh as Spacetime.

In my mind, most of the above is fairly well-grounded; feel free to rip it apart
as necessary.

## Conjectures

What follows are the main conjectures I’d like to throw out there as food for
thought:

1. **Color Duality**: The duality between Aetherius and Mundus, along with the
   association between the subtractive color wheel and the Magne-Ge leads to the
   natural idea that the (D)Aedra are associated with the [additive colors][17].
   Comparing the two color wheels leads to the inversion duality between the
   inside and outside of the boundary event horizon.

1. **The Spectral Equation**: As an extension of the above notion, 1 Blend
   Sign + 2 distinct, non-Blend Color Signs = {Magne-Ge Triplet} → Enantiomorph
   → 1 (D)Aedric dual in Mundus. We have 4 Blend signs total, which leads to 384
   unique triplets of Magne-Ge. When combined with the Enantiomorph ordering,
   that leaves us with 2,304 distinct (D)Aedra[^2]. Note that this kind of
   decomposition lets us describe all aspects of the (D)Aedra as attributed by
   Nirnian cultures. For example, my head canon claims: *Scintil (Blend as*
   *Witness) + Thermallélé (K as Rebel) + Wode-Rub (C as King) = Lorkhan*.

   Furthermore, this equation would ideally state how a given et’Ada relates to
   a Birthsign, and how its constituent Magne-Ge relate to stellar positions in
   the Birthsign[^3]. Additionally, most of the Khajiiti pantheon would involve
   the Caker King (Blend). Please feel free to list any further decompositional
   equations you might think of below.

1. **Lorkhan anticipated the Breaking**: Since the star/tears left Magne-Ge as
   we provide a constant source of magicka/light/creatia to Mundus, I strongly
   believe it was part of Lorkhan’s plan all along to have the Magne-Ge escape
   to allow the perpetual stream of Aetherial creative energy to soak into the
   Nirn. Perhaps this energy provides an active role that the (dead) Aedra could
   never have filled post-Breaking.

1. **et’Adic Echoes**: The et’Ada frequently revered on Nirn are really nothing
   more than the semi-comatose, echo-manifestations of congealed light from the
   Magne-Ge…these filtered clumps of light are redshifted(!) by Nirn’s gravity,
   decreasing its strength and distorting its content, but still allows the
   inhabitants of Nirn to feel its effects.

1. **Breaking Shattered Magne-Ge**: The Magne-Ge, like the Aedra, are in
   death-sleep. The Breaking of the boundary event horizon between Mundus and
   Aetherius annihilated them, but the creatia/energy that streamed through
   revived their mirror-echo selves and their (D)Aedric counterparts.

## Open Questions

- **Redshift**: How does the stellar Dance relate to Redshift at the mythopoeic
  level? Is this what the Marukhati did when the Broke the Dragon?
- **The Serpent Birthsign**: How does it migrate and overtake other signs?
- **Other Pantheon proper nouns**: Is Nana Null equivalent to Nirn, the world
  beyond the event horizon? Are the Untime Folk complementary to the mortals of
  Nirn? Can [Chrome Box][18] decompose the Magne-Ge into et’Ada and vice-versa,
  like a Aurbical manifestation of a Fourier Transform?
- **Events**: Wtf are the Y Blur, War of C and M, and Thermal-Talk?
- **Color and Sound**: How do we split up the entire spectrum of Beings over
  their corresponding, intercorrelated sensory scales? Can the Magne-Ge
  Enantiomorphs be cast as Major/Minor Chords associated with each et’Ada?

I strongly suspect that most of these questions can be answered by a list
breaking down each (D)Aedra into constituent et’Ada.
