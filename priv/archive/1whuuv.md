This folio was written at the same time I began to doubt the sanity of Hjorik,
who lost the battle against madness and passed away. This folio is strange and
confusing, and I do have not the faintest idea what he’s trying to say. Even so,
a piece of worth curiosity as well as others folios I have been collected.

*—Florencius Caligo.*

“And so, it is my conclusion that the Alduin of Nord legend is in fact mighty
Akatosh, whose story grew twisted and deformed through centuries of retelling
and embellishment”, spits Alexandre Simon, the lovely High Priest of the Akatosh
Chantry in his terrible book “The Alduin/Akatosh Dichotomy”.

No! No! No!

The Word-Eater is the strongest Sheogorath’s Dragon of all. The Word-Eater is
said to be a great, enlightened sage who went mad from the Blessings of Mighty
Sheogorath. In his illuminated state, he realized that he did no have to subsist
on mortal souls, but could consume anything and become more of what he ate. This
secret is unknown to dragons, only Mighty Sheogorath understands. Yes!

The Word-Eater ate rock, sky, colours, fishsticks, champions, sweet-rolls,
sweet-trolls, cheese and ideas, before he decided he liked ideas most of all! He
began to consume words, believing it would make him wise again, and restore his
sanity!

I’m surely sure that the words he ate were gone forever – and so were the ideas.
No one will ever know what ideas are missing, because they are gone forever and
gone retroactively. Some say the Word-Eater was limiting the world to smaller
and feebler reality on that time, and needed to be stopped. The Nords of old
were trying to reach his level of transcendent reality to prank him and end his
dangerous behaviour.

But the dragons defended him, saying that the Word-Eater is protecting
Sheogorath from his enemies and helping free all living ･ﾟﾟ･​･ﾟﾟ･​･ﾟﾟ･​･ﾟﾟ･​･ﾟﾟ･
