Thus concludes, mostly, the 22nd Sermon of Vivec.

Thus is also the basic underlying foundation of the argument outlined in the
title of this post. That Mephala remains as she always was: patron of the
Foresters’ Guild, a sad and forgotten Velothi relic.

Why would she assume the mantle of Sithis just to recreate the same organization
she already has? For too long, the prevailing consensus regarding the
Brotherhood’s divine patronage has been guided by a simplistic, conservative
line of reasoning - the god of one assassin’s guild is also the god of the
other’s.

Think for a moment of the Dark Brotherhood’s foundation. A splinter of the Morag
Tong, a recreation of it; more violent, passionate, famous, depraved, and
grandiloquent than its forebear.

Now read the Sermon 22 excerpt again. *“…one vast moving event of*
*thrusting-kill-laughter in alleys, palaces, workshops, cities and secret*
*halls.”* That doesn’t describe the Morag Tong, but it does describe a very
different group of assassins. Vivec didn’t usurp Mephala’s place as patron of
the Foresters’ Guild of Morrowind. He supplanted it with his own, better
realisation. The Dark Brotherhood.

Why? Well, it’s right there in the Sermon: to earn the Treasure Wood Sword from
the King of Assassins. This was his immediate goal, and its fulfillment created
the Brotherhood. Note, however, that **he never destroys the sword.** Unlike all
the other Children of the Pomegranate Banquet, its fate is left unclear.

[A blade][0], gifted by the [King of Assassins][1]? Well, well. Doesn’t that
sound familiar.

It is telling that the organization is ruled jointly by a Mother and a Father. A
Cyrodiilic corpse and a nebulous Void-spirit, according to Brotherhood
orthodoxy. Vivec, whose motherhood brought into the world the Treasure Wood
Sword, and whose fatherhood brought into the world the “hundred murderous sons”
(Brothers, it is duly noted), embodies this duality far better than the flimsy
official line. He known as Vehk is the Dread Father and she known as Vehk is the
Night Mother.

There is one dangling loose end yet to be severed in all this. The choice of
Sithis, which really has always been the true problem. Of course, it’s possible
that Vivec was simply hedging, hiding his identity as a Dunmeri god so as not to
stifle a more multicultural Brotherhood. But there is a better reason.

**Vivec admires Sithis.** [It gets the most glowingly positive description of
any entity in the Sermons.][2] Apart from the Sermons, Vivec [anonymously pens a
book describing it as the creator of the world.][3] If anyone loves Sithis to
the point of enshrining it as the most feared and respected concept in Tamriel,
even (especially!) with a lie, it’s Vivec.
