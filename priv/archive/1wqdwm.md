Hello everyone,

I’ve decided to meld the notions of [gravity][0] and [spacetime][1] with the
little we know of [quantum mechanics][2] in the Aurbis, along with /u/myrrlyn’s
[musical][3] [construct][4] into one overarching theory. The result is (perhaps
un)surprisingly connected to string theory, a highly conjectural and currently
unverifiable theory of quantum gravity.

If you’re intimidated by the length of this piece; do not fear. I decided to
include brief yet (hopefully) intuitive explanations of the more technical
concepts instead of relying on Wikipedia to feed you everything. The one
skippable section would be **Additional Structure**; it basically describes how
to view music as a collection of abstract, geometric spaces. If you’re still not
feeling up for it, then at least skim through **The Big Picture** section below.

Let’s get started!

## The Essential Ingredients

**Spacetime**: Aka + Lorkhan = AkaLorkh, and together they act as the background
of 4D spacetime. AkaLorkh is responsible for gravitational motion and curvature.
Squashing the two Aedra together results in a Dragon Break[^1].

**Quantum Mechanics and Spacetime**: Jills can fix the region of a Dragon Break
by treating all the worldlines (paths in spacetime) as waves, and applying the
sum-over-histories technique to find the most consistent timeline. This
effectively treats spacetime quantum mechanically, then squashes it into a
projected, collapsed state.

**Musical Aurbis and Spacetime**: The (D)Aedra are split on a 24 tone scale as
described in /u/myrrlyn’s posts. As this must be merged with the spacetime
theory, consider the following modifications to the original post:

1. Lorkhan acts as both space (percussion as Doom Drum) and time (by setting the
   beat).

1. Correspondingly, Aka acts as both space (by setting its fundamental frequency
   and hence length) and time (by setting the tempo).

These two changes allow them to act simultaneously as AkaLorkh, the Gray Maybe,
both for music and a background.

## Additional Structure (skippable)

**Music as a space**: The geometry inherent in music has not been discussed much
in academia; this is likely due to its highly esoteric and interdisciplinary
nature.

Progressions, chords, voice leading, scales: all structures present within music
can be reduced to a compact, yet somewhat complex mathematical object called an
orbifold = orbit + manifold. The general idea is to take a manifold (one of the
most generic notions of a smooth space), and [“divide”][5] [^2] by some
symmetries (a.k.a. orbits); the resulting space is an [orbifold][6]. Only
recently have mathematicians published articles on musical orbifolds, with
Tymoczko being one of the more prominent proponents of the notion ([here’s the
mathematical paper if you’re interested][7], pdf warning).

The most generic idea of a musical orbifold is that of an n-dimensional torus
[^3] **T**^*n*^, divided by the [symmetric group][8] *S*^*m*^ (the symmetry of
interchangeability)[^4]. The variable *n* encodes the number of pitches in a
sequence, and *m* refers to the number of tones in each chord. The space
**T**^*n*^/*S*^*m*^ thus accounts for octave symmetry and chordal permutations.
Thus, all music lives on the [union][9] of these spaces for all *m* and *n*.

N.B.: If you’re following along with the pdf, then please note that in our
Aurbical scale, there are 24 tones, with Mara and Dibella identified on the
vertical boundaries denoted in [Figure 2][10]. [This][11] is an example of the
3D projection of **T**^2^/*S*^2^.

## The Recipe

How do we reconcile spacetime with our musical spaces? By using the notion of
[compactification][12] from theoretical physics. Essentially, we will glue
copies of the above musical structure onto each point in spacetime; it would
look something like [this][13].

The musical structure is pasted onto physical spacetime through AkaLorkh’s
fundamental frequency or beat which sets the “size” of the music space. This
scale-setting frequency acts as an anchoring Tower for all the other frequencies
present in the scale. This, coupled with their tempo and drum gives a relative
spacetime orientation to this musical space. Spoken differently, AkaLorkh as
music is the subgradient echo of AkaLorkh as spacetime, which binds these dual
spaces. A region with spacetime curvature will influence its inner musical
dynamics, and faster-paced piece will bend the resulting spacetime.

## Dynamics

For a particle[^5] over at a point in Mundus, we can associate a wave its
musical subspace; it is a [wavefunction][14], analogous to a chord or a complex
progression such as a [leitmotif][15]. However, a wavefunction is quantum
mechanical, and represents a wave of pure potential and probability[^6], which
travels from spacetime point to spacetime point according to its harmonic
content. Thus, it is not quite yet Music as we know it; it is a melody of
potentials. Any possible particle can be described by a different “musical”
piece. In addition, if a particle is spread over a region due to quantum
fuzziness, then it’s described by the [entanglement][16] of all its musical
subspaces from each point. Entanglement can be thought of as the joining of
melodies from different instruments, or as intertwined staves on sheet music.
[Wavefunction collapse][17] can be understood as a harmonic resolution, or as
the convergence of intertwined staves into one staff.

When two particles interact, their harmonies collide and interfere, collapsing
their wavefunctions inducing the phenomena of entanglement and linking them
together until further collapse. This process gives back classical dynamics by
taking the limit of large amounts of particles; constant contact with close
neighbors forces the fuzzy wavefunctions to constantly collapse into
well-defined regions.

It is at this point that the first harmonic echoing subgradient occurs: in
keeping to constrained wavefunctions, the particles are essentially vibrating in
spacetime. If this vibrational wave echoes the particle’s musical harmonies,
then this should lead to a resonant coupling between spacetime and the quantum
musical subspace. The resonance excites nearby particles which induces the
emission of Color and Sound on a macroscopic scale.

As mentioned above, a Dragon Break results from spacetime being smashed
together; this results in the particles’ worldlines, the very fibers of
spacetime, to become quantum mechanical. This occurs since every spacetime
point’s musical substructure becomes entangled and acts as a gravitational
wavefunction. The Jills pick apart and merge the pieces with carefully
calculated gravitational path integrals.

## Consequences

- Sword-Singing, Kiai, Thu’um, Tonal Architecture…these are all manipulations of
  the inherent musical substructure and its ties to spacetime and mass-energy.
  The highly complex musical subspaces explains why these schools require years
  of practice; these notions must resonate with your own set of musical
  orbifolds.

- The Elder Scrolls are coherent wavefunctions made from the fabric of Spacetime
  itself; once history has been made they can solidify their projection of
  potential future worldlines, but still remain in a state of flux. They can be
  thought of as neutralized Dragon Breaks (with potentially inconsistent or
  bizarro timelines mixed in), and are useless during a Dragon Break since Time
  itself has collapsed.

- The Towers as Maestros focus resonant energy from Aetherius and the Void
  whilst simultaneously broadcasting Music and Color back into Oblivion. The
  arriving energy solidifies Nirn’s wavefunction through quantum mechanical
  collapse. The outgoing energy resonates with the (D)Aedric spheres. (D)Aedric
  artifacts on Nirn are mostly made of a pure (D)Aedric tone.

## Conjectures

- The Music and Color from Mundus leak through the holes left by the Magne-Ge,
  who listen in carefully from Aetherius. If the frequencies are right, they
  will Dance to a matching pattern of light and color, leading to the movement
  of the stars in the sky.

- The Aurbis is a [Turing-complete][18] quantum orchestra, with AkaLorkh’s bulk
  as the sheet music (instruction tape). During a Dragon Break, the sheet music
  itself becomes an Elder Scroll, and the Mnemoli delightedly sweep in to
  collect their treasure.

- Divinities and Blessed mortals (e.g. Shezzarines) are coherent, macroscopic
  quantum objects that can only be collapsed by each other; this is what leads
  to the power of the Enantiomorph equation. The 3-turned-1 entanglement aspect
  is a resonant chord from their musical subspaces.

## The Big Picture

As an abstract, finalized big picture: imagine Mundus as a fractal, highly
sophisticated music box, with a musical probability wave space attached to each
point in spacetime. Particles are traveling musical progressions that are
subject to quantum mechanical collapse. Macroscopic effects are tied to the
echoing of the musical subgradient. The music box is self-correcting, filled
with infinite capacity for memory, and can broadcast its Music via its Towers.
The resulting harmonies travel to Aetherius via the boundary membrane between
the two, which acts like a speaker.

The Magne-Ge are in Aetherius, listening to the Music from the box, and dancing
a Dance of color and light, an array of frequencies and amplitudes that
corresponds to the subtractive colors; [a different eigenbasis][19] for the
sounds emanating from the box. For them, Mundus is outputting a fantastically
dynamic light show composed of the additive colors.

From within Mundus, the Magne-Ge dance across the Boundary canvas, resonating
with the Music within and radiating energy through Color into the Void. The
Aetherial fragments known as the Elder Scrolls resonate with the incoming waves
of creatia.

[^1]: I’ve received a few messages regarding how to ‘squash’ spacetime; the answer is to speed up! For regular space, rotating axes looks like [this](https://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/faculty/stierman/files/Image2.gif). For spacetime, ‘rotation’ between time and space is equivalent to speeding up, and looks like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MinkDiagrScale.svg). If you go at *c*, the speed of light, then your two axes merge and form a singular line.

[^2]: Dividing one space by another can be visualized as a ‘wrapping’ or identification of points. For example, a circle, denoted **S**^(1), can be thought of the real numbers **R** divided by the integers **Z**, which implies wrapping a number line on itself every integer. This works out since **S**^1 is a periodic number line.

[^3]: [Tori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus) are interesting objects. We can think of them as geometric products of circles (**T**^2 = **S**^1 x **S**^(1), a donut), and thus as products of **R**/(N **Z**), where N is the periodicity on the integers.

[^4]: For example, *S*^3 is the number of ways to permute 3 objects. If we label those objects 1, 2, and 3, then the members of the group are {1,2,3}, {1,3,2}, {2,1,3}, {2,3,1}, {3,1,2}, and {3,2,1}.

[^5]: By particle I mean an *atomos* of matter or energy (e.g. light).

[^6]: Untapped creatia, if you will.
