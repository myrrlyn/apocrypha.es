First, I know it’s a long read. If you want to know wheter you’ll be interested
in, you might want to skip the presentation. I thought it would be useful, but
if you already know a bit of this, you might say it’s boring.

In the Elder Scrolls, numbers have a meaning. Numbers are symbols, but have also
influence on the world, and describe how events and things are related. And, it
seems, not really throught equations, but through weird numerology. 2, and its
relation to the enantiomorphe, is probably obvious for most of the person here,
and you may have heard of 11 “1+(-1) = 11, that’s CHIM lol”.

But, there is more. A lot more, and a lot more interesting. We truly dicovered
this in the Hunt for the Amaranth, when MK threw

> _29. 2. 9. 11. 7. 18._

Then it gets all messed up with 4.5.

We have been a lot to share ideas about this, and I must admit I am unable to
remember who has done what – just note that a lot of things I will comment now
have been discovered by other persons.

However, even if there is repercussions on most of the lore, numbers with a true
signification are not used a lot- but there is usually links. And most of what
we learn about these numbers come, in fact, from the 36 Sermons. Not really
surprising, when we know that Chimer despised their old Gods, who where [“only
numbers now”][0], and insult stranger when saying they are [“devoid of
maths”][1].

Because of this, however, I won’t give the source for most of my quotes – It
comes from [the Sermons][2] if I didn’t bother giving a link. In fact, this
thread could nearly be seen as an analysis of Sermon 29 (which is seen as a
synthetis of the 35 others, and some other texts). In a first time, the known
meaning of the numbers will be presented, then how we find these meanings, and
relations.

For those who are asking the second number present in the “list” of this Sermon,
like the 283 of _17. The Hurling Disk. 283_ : it is a key to a secret message.
When taking the word corresponding to the second number, in the Sermon of the
first number, you find the overdiscussed testimony : _“He was not born a god._
_His destiny did not lead him to this crime. He chose this path of his own free_
_will. He stole the godhood and murdered the Hortator. Vivec wrote this”_ I have
heard of no other thought about these numbers, so I won’t give any other
interpretation that they lead to this message?

_1. The Dragon Break, or the Tower._ : “I”, 1 (in TES, 1 should always be seen
only as a line). It is what leads to “I AM”. And to “I AM NOT”. the realization
of being Anu, or rather his dream, or the ability to distinguish from him.
Tower, “I”, is also compared to what is seen when a wheel (the Aurbis) is seen
from sideway

> Look at the majesty sideways and all you see is the Tower, which our ancestors
> made idols from.
>
> The secret Tower within the Tower is the shape of the only name of God, I.

Towers are used on Nirn, to gather creatia/magicka, and this way stabilize the
world, but also to change things, and maybe even are used to have a way to
“godhood”: Dracochysalid, Destruction of the Aurbis… Finally, these towers are
there to trigger Dragon Breaks – Something which seems to be strongly tied to
Walking Ways, as when one is attempting a Way, a Dragon Break occures.

---

_2. The Enantiomorph._ : 1 + 1. The Enantiomorph, two people who are one, A
King, A Rebel, indistinguishable except for the Witness. They can switch places,
and they create something new, often at a gradient lower. There is too much
examples, so I wont give all of them.

---

_3. The Invisible Gate, ALMSIVI. 112_ : For Now, we will only say that this
number, the Tribunal, is important, but most of what we know about it is how it
is related to the others. ALMSIVI seems to be only one of the Tribunals ; Talos
Tribunal, made of Talos, Talos, and Talos, is mentionned in [TC:I][5]

---

_4. The Corners of House of Troubles. 242_ : Bal, Sheo Malac and Dagon for
Almsivi, they may change for Talos. They seems to be a danger, which appears in
the creation of the Gate.

---

_5. The Corners of the World. 100_ : The best interpretation for this one is
probably the comparison between the world, Nirn, and a person. The five corners
would therefore be the arms, the legs, and the head.

---

_6. The Walking Ways. 266_ : The Ways to Heaven; their true meaning is creating
a lot of discussion. Some talk of these as ways to Amaranth, some as Ways to
CHIM, some as ways to godhood. Whatever, we seem to know the steps on these
ways: Egg, image, Man, God, City, State and some attempts (the last might be the
good one): The Numidium. The Endeavor. The Prolix Tower. CHIM. The Enantiomorph.
The Scarab that Transforms into the New Man.

---

_7. The Sword at the Center. 39_

> The magical cross is an integration of the worth of mortals at the expense of
> their spirits. Surround it with the triangle and you begin to see the Triune
> house. It becomes divided into corners, which are ruled by our brethren, the
> Four Corners: BAL DAGON MALAC SHEOG. Rotate the triangle and you pierce the
> heart of the Beginning Place, the foul lie, the testament of the
> irrefutable-for-a-span

You have a I, which become a master 11, and makes a Cross, +. Or 7. It seems to
be the “OS” of Mundus (like Tal\[OS]) You surround it with Triangles (Almsivi or
TALOS Tribunal) and have a square divided in four. If you rotate the triangle,
the corner of the house of trouble pierce the master at the center. The 8 Spokes
prevent the triangles of rotating. All of this is makig a Wheel (with two
acceptable blashem between each spoke): sideway, it is a I, and you can see at
the center of the side the secret gate. Do you want a [(shitty) picture?][6]

> The sword is the cross and ALMSIVI is the Triune house around it. If there is
> to be an end I must be removed.

Yes. Soon or late, the sword must be removed.

---

_8. The Wheel, or the Eight Givers. 484_ : The Spokes. But, first of all,
givers. Divines gave their support to Talos ; For Vivec, it seems it is the
Barons of Move Like This, and Fa-Nuit-Hen who gave him what let him become a
Master.

---

_9. The Missing. 11_ : Usually seen as Lorkhan, the Missing God. But also the
eight, who is adding to the 8 but cannot be seen (the divines are planets, Talos
isn’t) Its interaction with the enantiomorph sees to be very important. 9 + 2 =
11, The Master, who usually reached CHIM. 9-2 = 7, the Sword at the Center. And,
yes, Talos or Vivec seems to be privated from their enantiomorphic part. 2 × 9 =
18, The Egg, which is thought to be linked to the (Nu) Amaranth. The worst is 9
➗ 2 = 4.5, which probably represent the weakening of Talos and of the 9 by the
Thalmor. Which would lead to the 9 breaking in 2, and leaving the integers…
might be bad for the Aurbis.

---

_10. The Tribes of the Altmer. 140_ : Well, there isn’t much on them, aside from
counting the number of tribes the Altmer divided into.

---

_11. The Number of the Master. 102_ : Masters are those on the Walking Ways.
Vivec, Lorkhan, Talos, Nerevar. Most of them reached CHIM, but some may have
taken other Ways. The example of CHIM is when you manage to have 1 + (-1) = 11.
It is also 9 + 2, as seen earlier.

---

_12. The Heavens. 379_ : First, as /u/Dreadnautilus reminded, it is the 12
constellations – completed by 13, the Serpent. Reach Heaven by Violence. 9 + 3,
The Sword at the center helped by a Tribunal is creating a way for Heavens.

---

_13. The Serpent. 36_

> ’I am born of golden wisdom and powers that should have forever been unalike!
> With this nature I am invited into the Hidden Heaven!’
>
> By which he meant the Scaled Blanket, made of not-stars, whose number is
> thirteen. Lie Rock became full of foolishness, haggling with the Void Ghost
> who hides in the religions of all men.

The Second Serpent is where the secret door is hidden. The first is Lorkhan (or
Satak, if you dare venture in the confusing Yoku pantheon), the Second Serpent,
THE Serpent, is the scaled Blancket, the constellation. Linked to SITHISIT, it
is made of no-stars, unstars, and might be in fact the hole Pasomay made when
entering into Anu’s Dream. In this case, it could also be seen as the secret
door to the Void, to Liberty.

However, note that Void Ghost is also more or less a reference to Lorkhan. While
still being more or less Sep, and therefore the Serpent constellation.

---

_14. The King’s Cough. 32_ : Some say it is CHIM, some Thu’Um (what, it would be
linked?° . Think of the “breathing of Royalty” of talos, whose throat were cut.
And, even if it is dubious, Mankar Camoran Speaking Fire.

---

_15. The Redeeming Force. 110_ : Absolutely nothing on this one…

---

_16. The Acceptable Blasphemes. 12_ : From the Pocket Guide to the Empire 1^st^
Edition. It’s the Daedra, the 16 Voids between the 8 Gift Limbs of the Divines.
Their exact nulerologic role is, however, unknown.

---

_17. The Hurling Disk. 283_ : 18 - 1 = 17 : The Hurling Disk, the Middle Dawn
happens during the Dragon Break, when Mundus is freed from all boundaries.
Mundus is hurled to _reach heaven by violence_. If our understanding is correct,
it is at one step of the Amaranth – step that may be walked throught the Secret
door, that could be opened by the Sword (or the Master) during the Middle Dawn.

---

_18. The Egg, or Six Times the Wise._ : Probably the “New Amaranth”, or one of
the Steps. It is the end of the numbers 29, 2, 9, 11, 7, 18 and 4.5 messing up.
Even if Vivec was an egg, it is probably someone different, as Vehk is part of
3, the Tribunal, and becomes 7, the Sword at the center (Sermons), and a 11, a
Master. Because, the egg is (also?) a part of the Walking Ways.

---

_19. The Provisional House. 258_

> Vivec then built the Provisional House at the Center of the Secret Door.

This house is linked to the vision: Vivec then saw the moths that would come
from the starry heart, bringing with them dust more horrible than the ash of Red
Mountain. He saw the twin head of a ruling king who had no equivalent. And eight
imperfections rubbed into precious stones, set into a crown that looked like
shackles, which he understood to be the twin crowns of the two-headed king. And
a river that fed into the mouth of the two-headed king, because he contained
multitudes.

Might be talos, the one able to hold the center that cannot hold.

Whatever, the provisional House seems to be the attempt of Vehk to reach the
Amaranth. Another time, if this is 18, the House would be 19, just above it. And
during a Dragon Break, Mundus would be at 17 ; so, Vehk woudl have to go
between.

However, he final fled, afraid of the “catastrophes in between” – probably the
things like the Godhead/Anu Awaking because of something going “out” of him. Or
simply Landfall.

---

_20. The Lunar Lattice. 425_ : The Khajiit are based on Lunar lattice, but there
may be a link with lunar currency, souls.

---

_21. The Womb. 13_ : Where the Egg, the first step, comes from.

---

_22. Unknown. 453_ : It is the same to me.

---

_23. The Hollow Prophet. 54_

---

_24. The Star Wound. 44_ : The “Star-wounded East” seems to be Morrowind. But it
is also a [reference][7] to the Red Mountain, the Star Wound : the heart of
Lorkhan is probably the Star, but it may also be The Blue Star going the
Mountain during Dragon Breaks.

---

_25. The Emperor. 239_ : Uhh… It cannot be so obvious…

---

_26. The Rogue Plane. 81_ : The rogue plane is Baan Dar as per the cosmology
article on TIL.

---

_27. The Secret Fire. 120_ : Gandalf? No:

First, read [this analysis][8], by /u/rottendeadite – I am not able to resume
this.

Then, this is mostly the links I see, but less thorough:

> Mephala and Azura are the twin gates of tradition and Boethiah is the secret
> flame.
>
> The fire is mine: let it consume thee, [](){:tag="br"} And make a secret door
> [](){:tag="br"} At the altar of Padhome, [](){:tag="br"} In the House of
> Boet-hi-Ah [](){:tag="br"} Where we become safe [](){:tag="br"} And looked
> after.

It seems to be strongly linked to the Provisional House; Vivec fled because he
couldn’t answer to “You House is safe now, So why is it—”. The catastrophes
mentioned earlier, which prevent him from “commiting to that marriage”. The
Altar of Padhome is safe. But, why…

---

_28. The Drowned Lamp. 8_

SITHSIT? He is strongly linked to Sithis, and PSJJJJ. Probably what stays from
Padomay, from what came from outside. And, this way, is linked to the Secret
door – throught the Serpent? Because unstars might be seen as a mirror of the
Sky. He is just a step lower than the Captive Sage.

Now, with the MK AMAs (/u/mojonation1487 reminded me of this one)

> Who or what is the Drowned Lamp?
>
> Drowned Lamp: Knowledge that is lost.

If we keep the link with Sithis, via Sithisit :

> What is Sithis?
>
> My Sithis? At its basest, it would be complete and utter misanthropy

Who is also presented as the Void/leading to the Void (yes, secret Door)

> In musical terms, would you say that the Void is subgradiated noise, pure
> silence, or something else entirely?
>
> (Where the fuck are you taking requests from?)
>
> I would say its deafness.

Here, we have a good thing that might say that the secret door is leading to
Void, to Sensory Deprivation.

---

_29. The Captive Sage. 217_ : The sage in sensory Deprivation, maybe even Anu
himself (29 2 9… begins à 29).

---

_30. The Scarab. 10_ : There’s a lot of thing about him.He is linked to
HoonDing, the Make Way God (who is also linked to Nerevar). And he would also be
the New Man of the Loveletter, maybe the New Amaranth. He is a step higher than
the captive sage, whiche give the same impression as with 17 and 19
surrounding 18.

---

_31. The Listening Frame. 473_ : Probably what Vivec used on Ysmir

> YSMIR, the Dragon of the North, who always appears as a great bearded king,
> had powers innumerable and echoing. He was grim and dark and the most silent
> of the invading chieftains, though when he spoke villages were uplifted and
> thrown into the sea. The Hortator fought him unarmed, grabbing the Dragon’s
> roars by hand until Ysmir’s power throat bled. These roars were given to Vivec
> to bind into an ebony listening frame, which the warrior-poet placed on
> Ysmir’s face and ears to drive him mad and drive him away.

However, Why 31? And what is the meaning behind this (when we know these one
came “5, in unholy number”)

---

_32. The False Call. 7_ : The Calling is What the Dwemer have may used to
communicate via telepathy/radio. It may be also the thing they used to melt into
Numidium. False walking Way, if we heard Vivec, and so, a False Call.

---

_33. The Anticipations. 234_ : 3 (Tribunal) is said to follow 3 (the
Anticipations). Some things let think that the Anticipation is a real thing, but
more between kalpa – Almsivi came too early, because this kalpas risks to have
no end. And, don’t talk about Reclamations, please.

The End of Days is “numbered 3333”. If it is truly Landfall, something with
Anticipations, and/or different Tribunal might happen.

---

_34. The Lawless Grammar. 2_ : Sword and Word. And, word without grammar are
like numbers without serious mathematical relation… what is done here…

---

_35. The Prison-Shirt. 191_ : Where the Velothi Mystic, a captive sage, is held?
(in the philosopher’s armor, where we see him falling in partial sensory
deprivation?)

---

_36. The Hours. 364_ : The 36 Sermons are a part of the Book of Hours. More
extracts are in Vehk’s Teaching.
