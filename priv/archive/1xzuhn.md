  Just sliding in on the theme of Crime at the last moment! A bit of silliness.

*By Cronus Veridas*

As an Imperial citizen, you likely know that the Empire has long been a
government with the prerogative to make laws which generally hold the best
interests of all the Empire’s people at heart. But not all attempts at
legislation are so clear-eyed, nor are they all so progressive. It is fortunate
that these imperatives are all but missing from the Empire’s history, but that
is not to say every motion of the Elder Council has been a good one. The
following are a few failed pieces of Imperial legislation.

- **Greeting Act of 3E 6** – Early in Tiber Septim’s reign, not all constituents
  of the Empire were so impressed with the rule we now hold as legendary,
  largely due to the fact that a large portion of the young empire was still
  newly conquered. The Elder Council sought to improve the Empire’s image and
  boost morale, and the Greeting Act was one of the more outlandish proposals of
  how to do just that. Under the law, it was initially proposed that all people
  of the Empire would be required to greet one another, “Salutations in the name
  of Emperor Tiber Septim, Defender of the Faith of the Eight Divines and the
  People of the Empire, may his reign last forever.” As the law was debated, the
  requirements were slackened until the greeting would only be required in the
  presence of a member of the Elder Council or a General of the Legion, but
  still the bill was doomed to fail.

- **Sobriety Act of 3E 70** – Uriel II’s reign was one beset from the start by
  insurrections and plagues, and it was seriously considered by a good portion
  of the Elder Council that prohibiting drink would solve these problems. A
  number of different approaches were suggested to enact the goal of “drying out
  the Empire”, but all were too impractical, not to mention significant backlash
  at the idea. The law never saw the light of day. Now, there is something to
  drink to.

- **New Succession Act of 3E 142** – Already weary of years of strife and war
  over the Ruby Throne, it was proposed that a new Emperor should be selected by
  an exhaustive process of assessment of a candidate’s political and military
  skill, knowledge of Imperial history, and views on matters of importance to
  everyday citizens. This bill died quickly with its introducer, who was slain
  by another member of the Elder Council who had his sights on the throne but
  did not meet the threshold of the testing.

These are only a few intriguing laws proposed in the Elder Council.

*Other Miscellaneous Failed Laws:*

- A quickly rejected proposal made in the Stormcrown Interregnum would have
  required the deflowering of any woman under twenty-three to take place in the
  presence of a priest of Dibella!

- One bill well into the Third Era would have subdivided Imperial currency,
  renaming the Septim the “Pelagius”, reapplying the Septim name to a unit one
  hundred times the value of a single Septim today, and adding a range of other
  varying units of money with the names of other prominent Imperial figures!

- It was suggested in 414 that the use of Old Cyrodiilic supplant New Cyrodiilic
  in matters outside of official documents, where it still sees use, but this
  was rejected based on the inability of a large portion of the Elder Council to
  speak or write in Old Cyrodiilic!

- One anti-Morrowind Councilor proposed that the word “Muatra” be stricken from
  Imperial speech, but this was denied because it could not be shown
  conclusively that “Muatra” was obscene!
