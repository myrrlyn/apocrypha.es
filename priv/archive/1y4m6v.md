  I’ve been reading lots of good lore lately, leading up to C0DA. It was quite
  the ride and I was urged to toss up a submission based on some poetry I’ve
  been reading. It’s out of my chest now, so please compliment, criticize, or
  contribute.

The hammer of the Doom Drum beat-beats, beat-beats. Black, Boet blood bleeds
from the starry heart-shaped hole. Vehk and Vehk lie safely beyond. The king’s
Razor maw is drawn into the death grin that ate even himself. Wind escapes as a
whisper of the seven hidden liberations. Highborn kinsman come to bear away
their stolen treasure. Kyne’s widow-wail carries unwish unto the mountain range.
The void ghost calls out from behind the moon-shadow, “I am Not! There, I did
not die!”
