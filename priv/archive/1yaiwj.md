It, then he, congealed in the house troubled land of Harvester’s ash sub ten the
Miracle of Peace. Birthnamed Amar-Sin and belonging to a clan Assarnibibi
shadowed, it, then he, herded guar through stonefalls dexterpathed to those in
requirement. Such was life for Amar-Sin, for not all lives begin with glass
castles and somersaults. Most begin with a drumbeat dawn and end with an
expeditious freeze. Sleeplessly, Amar-Sin herded beasts with his right hand
until the wind was made Sharmatic. The zephyr changed, Amar-Sin began to lead
his stock with his left hand.

"I wish to dance," Amar-Sin said. "but do not know how."

"I DANCE TO A HEARTBEAT." the wind replied.

"I wish to write," Amar-Sin said. "but do not know how."

"I SHALL MAKE YOU A POET." the wind replied.

"I wish to forge," Amar-Sin said. "but do not know how."

"I FORGE WALKING BRASS." the wind replied.

"I will follow."

Chasing the whispair, herder now herded, it, then he, stalked deeply Red until
met with a golden masked song ghost-hot and star blind. Mer turned to beast at
the sight, skin corpsed and lungs pustular. Amar-Sin fell into a waking sleep as
the wind spoke once more:

> "WE MARK YOU DOHT SEHT OF SIX. BECOME HEARTHHEAL BOUND. I AM AND YOU ARE ALL
> ME. TO THE HALL OF TORQUE WITH YOU. FORGEVER UNDER DOHT VEHK BUT NEVER WITH
> THE HAMMER. BEAR THE FACE OF THE WORM."

As so it was that Doht Seht, precendently Amar-Sin, became adjutant to Vemyn,
sometimes called the Womb Snake. On first greeting, the ash lord took Doht
Seht’s eyes but not his sight, turned his face inside out, and smiled. With god
blood and demonheart, the blinded one toiled in pain birthing flat and edge. He
was called Ash Mender, Blighted Remantler, and Sempiternal Dancer of the Tilted
Science. When Beldoh Stone-Wrecker came demanding a shield equal to his
brother’s, the Ash Mender stayed Vemyn’s wrath and agreed to the task. Fleecing
Stone-Wrecker’s skin and crushing his organs to fuel the fire, he made a
bloodfeasted shield. Upon creating the shield, they were both made to match yet
it would not be enough to compassrose Gilvoth. In gratitude, Beldoh refused
Sovngarde for the hexagon.

His service would last until the coming of Moon and Star. That story comes anon.
For aurals made keen can do little else.
