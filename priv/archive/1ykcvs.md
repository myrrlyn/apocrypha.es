A long time ago, in the land then known as Mereth, the Dov ruled over Man with a
tyrannical streak.

The et’Ada who did not help with Nirn’s birth, looked on with jealousy. So they
became like them to gain some of this power. They were Mahfahlah, the
Webspinning Dragon, whose name translates to Fall-For-Magicka, Nahmirah, the
Decaying Dragon, whose name means  Fury-Allegiance-Hunter, Noktoornahl, the
Shadow dragon, whose name means Lie-Inferno-Living and Vahmirnah, the Nightmare
Dragon, whose name means Spring-Allegiance-Fury.

The Nords, who did not know any different, worshiped them as any other Dragons,
which pleased the Deceivers. But the other Dov saw through their lies, and
fought an almighty battle with them at Bromjunaar, which the Dragons won, but at
a price. Upon seeing their masters fight amongst each other, the Nords began to
wonder why some dragons were worthy of worship, and others weren’t. They came to
the conclusion that worshiping them was wrong, thus began the Dragon War.
