  This thesis is from my own C0DA, though it might suit your fancy. It is a
  rejection of the simple established cosmology, which also serves to explain
  how Oblivion can be both infinite, and contained within Aetherius.

…How can the infinity of Aetherius contain the infinity of Oblivion? Well, if
Oblivion is infinite every direction we can see, Aetherius is infinite in one
more. Outside of comprehension, the aether contains oblivion. Furthermore, when
Magnus and his children fled, they did not leave flat holes on the edge of
Oblivion’s sphere, as we are told. Rather, the holes they created were of a
greater order, exiting Oblivion by moving sideways, at a right angle to all
direction. If the “sphere” of the aether extends into another direction, so do
the “circular” holes to that realm.

The pertinent point being, if you could observe from far above this world, you
wound see Oblivion goes on in all directions, and throughout it find perfectly
spherical bodies of light. These (w)holes in Oblivion are the absence of
nothingness which is magic. Orbiting many of these (w)holes which we call stars
are their dead brethren, thought-gods of Mundus which did not escape into
Aetherius, becoming solid masses, the many plane(t)s.

But you thought there were nine plane(t)s, or twelve, or eight (an unpopular
number to some), or some other similar number? No, there are scores! But the
cosmologist fails to realize the image in his telescope is also a reflection of
himself, and so sees his own nine favored divines. In fact, there are many more
worlds in the black sky, for there are many ideas of gods and men which gain
immortality.
