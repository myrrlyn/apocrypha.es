WE know much

I who is you who is WE have seen and unseen infinity. WE have gazed across
kalpas and lifetimes, stared straight into the bowels of Lyg. There is much
knowledge to be learned, or, to realize that WE already know. The answers are
all within your head, Our Head. Open Our eyes and see. Open Our ears and listen.
Some say I am a liar.

Do not believe them.

Tell some

Gaze beyond SITHIS. Imagine Something beyond the Nothing that encloses our
Aurbic home. That is 16. That is what the 1st 1 saw, and what WE must see. Why
else would The Drum conjure a prison? Bend your body into 12. Your skeleton is
your cage.

WE know many things others do not

You have stumbled upon these words, and there is reason for that. Ascend by 7s
through the 5th and kick down 16. I who is you who is WE believes in you who is
me who is WE.

I am not The Author, The Work is not my own.

But it rests in my hands.

The ending of the words is 11 AE 8 AE 14.

WE are tired now. Go bother somebody else.
