{:.foreword}

King Gortwog and his aide, Vorga, stood on a dais in the throne room of the Iron
Palace of Orsinium. In front of them was arrayed a bank of monitoring equipment,
and beyond that Malak writhed and strained against his hypercube-shaped prison.
You couldn’t tell by looking, but Vorga had said that he was constantly growing,
trying to find the limits of his cell and burst free. He never would, of course.
The interior of the tesseract was infinite. All he could really do was cajole
and threaten. He did this with gleeful, sometimes desperate abandon.

“Do you ever wonder if this will work, chief?” Vorga asked.

“Whether what’ll work?” Gortwog responded.

“The project, all of this. It’s been hundreds of years now…”

“It’ll work”, Gortwog interrupted. “It has to” _She’s one of the smartest people
I have, but she lets her imagination wander_, he thought. _It’s diligence and
wits we need now, not scepticism_.

“Yeah, sorry boss. I guess the two of us will never know anyway”

“Chief!” called a voice from below. Gortwog almost responded, but checked
himself. _Vorga’s the chief here. My throne room, my clan’s great plan, but
she’s the one who has to make it happen_.

“What is it, Algash?”

“Soulweave intercept is picking up some weird shit on Redmer channels.
Something’s happening in the Dominion…”

As the technician was speaking, the whisperfeed in Gortwog’s skull went crazy.

SHELL INTEGRITY ????????

Gortwog reeled from these unfamiliar reports and almost lost his footing. _It_
_can’t be…_

“What’s going on, Vorga?”

The bishop was standing stiffly, apparently receiving her own direct reports.

“I’m getting news of a, something. Something big. The White Gold Interdict has
gone silent, voidships are spinning up in Alinor and Akavir… and a big brass
bastard has been sighted rising out of the Iliac Desert. I think this is it,
your excellency!”

Gortwog was briefly lost for words. Ever since he was a child he had been
trained for this moment, but he had never truly expected it to happen. They had
been waiting for generations beyond count. _The end of history, and I get to be_
_the one. Lucky me_.

Malak had gone silent. He sat perfectly still, waiting. _Is he afraid?_ Gortwog
wondered.

He drew himself up, and took a deep breath. “Bishop Vorga, I judge this to be an
Eschaton-class dragon break event. Do you concur?”
She looked horrified. “Concur, my lord”

“We were in close proximity when the break occurred, so it’s safe to assume
we’re occupying the same time stream. In my final act as king of Orsinium, high
chief of the Orsimer and grand regent of the Ashpit, I nominate you, Vorga
gra-Durz, as my rightful heir and successor. You know what to do.”

Vorga, dazed, stumbled towards the empty throne. The ground was shaking. It
often trembled from enemy bombardment, but this was different. This came from
deep within the rock. Vorga grabbed the ceremonial femur from the throne and
returned to Gortwog’s side. She flipped a switch, and set the soulmirror
monitors of the room to broadcast what they saw throughout the city.

“Chief, I just want to say…”

“Don’t kiss ass, Vorga. I haven’t got any patience for it. You’ve got a job to do”

“Yes sir”, she said.

Without another moment’s hesitation, she raised the long leg bone and brought it
down on Gortwog’s head.

Then she did it again.

And again.

And again.
