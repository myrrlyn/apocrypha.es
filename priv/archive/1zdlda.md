  Time to put my Gypsy blood to use [again][0].

  I’ve been working on this for a while, and only just recently decided to
  finish it. I’ve read [Tarot cards][1] for a few years; I inherited a set from
  my mother and always thought they were awesome, so I decided to try and
  connect them to Elder Scrolls lore.

  Oh, and before you read any further, I need to mention everyone’s favorite
  scholar, [laurelanthalasa][3], and thank her for all her help. If any idea
  here strikes you as noticeably good, it was probably her work.

So, the Tarot is made of two sections, the Major Arcana, which is what I will
deal with here, and the Minor Arcana. The Minor Arcana works like usual playing
cards, with four suits (swords, pentacles, wands, and cups) numbered from ace to
ten, and then four face cards (page, knight, queen, king). The Major Arcana is
what most people are familiar with. Each card has a name, usually of a figure
(Death, Justice, The Devil), and it depicts a story. The Major Arcana begins
with card 0, The Fool, who encounters every other card and learns from what they
have to offer. The journey ends with enlightenment, as The Fool has learned
everything there is to learn. That’s what struck me, as Elder Scrolls lore has a
big emphasis on enlightenment, CHIM. The goal of mortal life is to obtain that
enlightenment, so we are all The Fool, in a way, stumbling through life as we
attempt to obtain a better understanding of our world.

The deck used is the typical Rider-Waite, and any deviation from that will be
noted.

> [![The Fool][0-img]][0]
>
> 0 – [The Fool][0] – Mortals.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

The Fool gazes onward towards the horizon, unaware of the cliff he is about to
step over. He is not worried, for he does not even know there is a problem. Like
him, mortals are unaware of the truth of their reality (I AM AND I ARE ALL WE)
but are destined to obtain that knowledge.

> [![The Magician][1-img]][1]
>
> 1 – [The Magician][1] – Lorkhan.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

The Magician is much like The Fool, but while The Fool has blind wisdom, The
Magician channels his knowledge into a creative force. He represents getting
stuff done. Lorkhan created Mundus, and allowed mortals to be so they might know
CHIM. The Magician is in the pose of “as above, so below” like how Lorkhan
created the spheres of existence out of the uniform Dawn.

> [![The High Priestess][2-img]][2]
>
> 2 – [The High Priestess][2] – Kyne.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

An “ideal woman” like Kyne, who supported her husband, even as the other Ada
ripped him to shreds. The High Priestess is a mystical figure of intrigue, much
like the divine force of nature that is Kyne. She stands between two opposing
pillars that reflect the sides of nature in how it both creates and destroys.

> [![The Empress][3-img]][3]
>
> 3 – [The Empress][3] – Mara.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

A motherly figure of fertility. She just screams “Mara.” She is a symbol of love
and prosperity. Also, Mara has connotations of Nir, the beloved of Anu, which
gives her a slight connection to…

> [![The Emperor][4-img]][4]
>
> 4 – [The Emperor][4] – Akatosh.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

Akatosh was born of Aka who is a sub gradient of Anu, so Mara, as a possible
reflection of Nir, is fit to be his empress. Also, Akatosh upholds the highest
force of order, time, as The Emperor is a very masculine figure of order and
royalty. Akatosh is also chief of the Imperial pantheon, and a highly universal
deity.

> [![The Heirophant][5-img]][5]
>
> 5 – [The Hierophant][5] – Julianos.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

A figure of tradition and wisdom, people bow before him as they wish to partake
in his knowledge. Julianos is known as a symbol of education, his temples often
serve more as universities than places of worship. He also represents tradition
in his Nordic aspect as Jhunal.

> [![The Lovers][6-img]][6]
>
> 6 – [The Lovers][6] – Dibella.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

The Lovers represent a more physical form of love and attraction. They are
attracted to each other on an instinctual and carnal level, which is the
difference between Mara’s love and Dibella’s love. The two reflect the two sides
of Dibella’s sphere, the sacred union of love, and pleasures of the flesh. Their
naked forms represent art in its purest way, as nothing is more natural and
beautiful than life.

> [![The Chariot][7-img]][7]
>
> 7 – [The Chariot][7] – Talos.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

The driver of the chariot is not the only figure depicted, as two sphinx pull
him along, but there is no question who is in charge. From Love comes Talos, a
trinity of three that is dominated by Tiber. The Chariot represents conquest,
taking things and driving head first into glory, much like the mighty emperor
Tiber Septim. An often violent symbol, like the man who conquered heaven through
violence.

> [![Justice][8-img]][8]
>
> 8 – [Justice][8] – Sotha Sil.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

Cold, calculating logic. A man deep in thought who is not blinded by his
emotions. Seht is a patron of intellect, an innovator and inventor who, like
Justice, also wields a large amount of authority.

> [![The Hermit][9-img]][9]
>
> 9 – [The Hermit][9] – Magnus.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

The Hermit represents isolation, the need to get away and be by yourself so you
can meditate within. Magnus withdrew himself from everything, from his own
designs, and finds it best to remain eternally in solitude.

> [![The Wheel of Fortune-img][10-img]][10]
>
> 10 – [The Wheel of Fortune][10] – The Aurbis.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

The Wheel (see the connection?) represents things happening outside of your
control. The world is so much larger than just you, events transpire that you
will never even hear about all the time. It also teaches us that all things are
temporary (like our mortal lives) as The Wheel will just keep turning.

> [![Strength][11-img]][11]
>
> 11 – [Strength][11] – Almalexia.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

I like this one. What we see is a woman subduing a lion, not killing it, only
subduing it. Ayem is a symbol of strength and power, but she also represents
mercy and motherhood to her people. Both display great strength, but an ability
to control themselves.

> [![The Hanged Man][12-img]][12]
>
> 12 – [The Hanged Man][12] – Nerevar.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

Why does he hang? Is he being punished, or is he merely relaxing? Like The
Hanged Man, Nerevar sacrificed himself for his people, but he feels no fear, as
he returns as the Nerevarine. His death is also very ambiguous, much like The
Hanged Man’s state.

> [![Death][13-img]][13]
>
> 13 – [Death][13] – Alduin.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

Everyone’s favorite card. Death comes to us all, everyone dies, but notice how
the sun rises over the mountains in the distance. So,e things end, and that
allows for other things to begin. Death is just a reset, really, like Alduin’s
endless cycle of devouring kalpas for new ones to begin.

> [![Temperance][14-img]][14]
>
> 14 – [Temperance][14] – Vivec.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

A symbol of harmony, the joining of opposites, like how Vicec joins male and
female brains and brawn. Look at the mysticism evident in the cups, is the water
flowing up or down? Does it matter? Vivec embodies these mystical paradoxes as
the posterboy/girl for CHIM.

> [![The Devil][15-img]][15]
>
> 15 – [The Devil][15] – Sanguine.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

Everyone’s other favorite card. The Devil embodies excess and how limiting it
is. Submitting yourself to decadence will condemn you to his slavery like the
people chained to him, as it becomes a downward spiral that distracts you from
productive things. Also, The Devil’s suffering is all his own, look how he sits
on an obviously uncomfortable pedestal. It is far too small, but he is too
enraptured by his desires to notice. Sanguine is the patron of party, and none
of his domains actually accomplish anything.

> [![The Tower][16-img]][16]
>
> 16 – [The Tower][16] – The Tower.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

Well, yeah. Notice how the people are abandoning the tower behind them? They’re
probably falling to their deaths, but they want to escape the tower (Mundus)
that badly. The Tower represents transformation and the gain of new knowledge,
like CHIM.

> [![The Star][17-img]][17]
>
> 17 – [The Star][17] – Meridia.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

The star symbolism is the first thing, Meridia is a fallen Magna – Ge. Also, The
Star represents life and renewal, which ties in her to title as the “lady of
infinite energies.”

> [![The Moon][18-img]][18]
>
> 18 – [The Moon][18] – Sithis.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

The Moon is a sad figure of self – doubt and inner fear. Sithis is the force of
entropy that permeates us and wastes away at the world. The Moon gazes down upon
its subjects with its eyes shut, seeing yet not seeing them, like how Sithis is
everywhere yet nowhere, you cannot escape or find Nothing.

> [![The Sun][19-img]][19]
>
> 19 – [The Sun][19] – Y’ffre.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

A sign of optimism and joy, Y’ffre is like The Sun as a patron of song and
happiness. The Sun has connections to Apollo, who was granted his lyre by Hermes
(who often represents The Magician), similar to how Y’ffre gave himself to
Lorkhan’s plan to become the first earthbone.

> [![Judgement][20-img]][20]
>
> 20 – [Judgement][20] – Arkay.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

The dead rise before Judgement, as death is just a limit, it is far from the
end. Arkay wards over the dead, and represents absolution, as he is believed to
also be an aspect of Malacath, making him simultaneously a foul Daedra and a
Divine.

> [![The World][21-img]][21]
>
> 21 – [The World][21] – Amaranth.
> {:tag="figcaption"}
{:tag="figure"}

And here we arrive at the end. The journey is complete, we all are one within
The World, a symbol of wholeness and unity. CHIM has been achieved, we have seen
that I ARE ALL WE. We become The World within ourselves.

Interesting notes include the number 7. Start from 1 and multiply by 7, you get
The Magician, The Chariot, Temperance, and The World, or Lorkhan, Talos, Vivec,
and Amaranth. There lies a pattern of figures who are associated with CHIM.

Also, Justice, Strength, and Temperance make up the cardinal virtues. Sotha Sil,
Almalexia, and Vivec make up ALMSIVI, and all three cards are three spaces away
from each other.

Well, I hope you enjoyed my analysis. Some things to take note of is the more
obvious symbolism, Meridia is The Star, yes, but Magnus is not the Sun and Azura
is not The Moon. They share symbolism, but when you get into an analysis of
them, that’s where the similarities end.
