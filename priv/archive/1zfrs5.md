## Ta’agra Language Study

(These notes are by /u/Mr_Flippers, who has spent more time with Ta’agra than I
have.)

- Ta’agra lacks definitive articles.
- Ta’agra has always struck me as a tonal language, like Mandarin Chinese.
- The meaning of individual words can vary on context, especially with tonal
  words like “Var” which has a different meaning depending on the tone and
  context.

### Sentence Structure

Every day I walk for water [](){:tag="br"}
Raj pal tohei da’khe iit [](){:tag="br"}
All days go water walk [](){:tag="br"}
\[adjective]-\[noun]-\[verb]-\[adjective]-\[noun]

I have a yellow quill [](){:tag="br"}
Zwinthodurrarr rabi [](){:tag="br"}
Yellow writing stick mine [](){:tag="br"}
\[adjective]-\[noun]-\[pronoun]

### Vowels

The Ta’agra language uses five vowels, a, e, i, o, u. The letter Y is used as a
vowel when it comes at the end of a word (generally preceded by another vowel).

### Consonants

Ta’agra uses very consonant except X, W and soft C. Consonants with no trailing
vowels are generally prefixes or the final syllable in the word.

### Double Consonants

Combinations of a pair of consecutive consonant occur frequently in Ta’agra

Phrases:

- q’zi no vano thzina ualizz – when I contradict myself I am telling the truth.
- Vaba do’shurh’do – it is good to be brave
- Vaba maaszi lhajiito – it is necessary to run away
- Fusozay var var – enjoy life (live life laughingly?)
- Fusozay var dar – kill without qualm (end life laughingly?)
- Ahzirr durrarriss – we give freely to the people (-iss|people, durrarr|write.
- Writing and giving similar?)
- Ahzirr trajijazeri – we justly take by force
- Ahn trajiir – for you
- Var var var – what will be will be (life lives[v] lives[n]?)
- Da aqqa dween (a commendation of sorts)
