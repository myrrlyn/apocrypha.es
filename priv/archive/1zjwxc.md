## Who Are The Conclave Of Baal?

To begin with, ‘Baal’ is not a moniker for ‘Molag Bal’ the Daedric Prince, and
if members of the Conclave ever heard such a thing they would kill you without
hesitation. So what does the word Baal mean? It is not in my place to tell you.
All I can say is that it is more of a series of concept than one an actual name,
and these concepts cannot be grasped truly grasped unless one can completely
understand its meaning.

## What Do They Do?

The Conclave of Baal is a secretive society that devotes much of their time to
the studying of ancient texts among most other things. Some of the more young
and inexperienced of my people refer to them as a group of ‘Warrior-Scholars’,
and it is hardly a fair assessment. Like nearly all Saxhleel, the Conclave can
be well versed in the arts of war. However, I’ve never seen them fight myself
before and so I cannot simply accept that opinion as fact. And like I said
before, they do many things.

## Where Are They?

The Conclave can be found throughout Black Marsh and especially within each
major city. However, they have never and will never leave the Marsh itself for
reasons that are their own and theirs alone. It is not wise to trouble the
Conclave of Baal.

## When And Why Were They Founded?

Such as matters as ‘when’ and ‘why’ do no have much significance in my homeland.
To the Conclave and the entirety of the Saxhleel, things exist because they can
and do and things stop existing because they did. The Conclave of Baal are here
because they want to be here, and that is all there is too it. Unless they
themselves wish to speak on the matter, and that’d be a feat all in it’s self.

## How Did They Aid The Eternal Champion?

During the dark ages of the Imperial Simulacrum, the Eternal Champion traveled
to Black Marsh to find the entrance to Murkwood, where one of the final pieces
of the Staff of Chaos presided. Traveling to Stormhold after hearing that the
Conclave of Baal could help in the new hiding place of Murkwood, the Eternal
Champion asked them for help on the quest. The Conclave agreed to use their
talents to read one of the fabled Elder Scrolls to locate Murkwood, but first
needed the aid one of their ancient tablets to help read the Scroll. The Eternal
Champion was sent to the monster-infested Vaults of Gemin, where the tablet
resided and came back victorious, and the Conclave were able to pinpoint the
exact location of Murkwood so the Champion could retrieve the Staff of Chaos
piece.

In a way, the Conclave are heroes just like the Eternal Champion is a hero.
Which is ironic, because they couldn’t care less about the entirety of Tamriel
in the slightest.

And that is all I know about the Conclave of Baal.
