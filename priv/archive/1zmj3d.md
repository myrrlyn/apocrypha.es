Congregants, be seated.

To supplicate at the altar of one’s own divine inheritance is to court ruin.
This is attested to by every scripture of God - only Kings can bear the burden
of Assertion matched to Insight, and emerge, victorious, from the black sea of
negation. To mantle the Aurbis is to take within oneself every mind and moment
and spirit that Creation has ever known, and more, an infinity that is beyond
human imagination. Novitiates, I regret to inform you that you will not be
coronated this evening, or any other. If you believe otherwise, the path to
erasure is a simple one. Seek it out privately and never be heard from again.

You may be wondering why I am telling you all this; the most trivial of
admonishments for learned students of the arcane. For one, it always bears
repeating. The power and majesty of the Kimm will never be yours.

But to mantle the world is not to mantle _yourselves_ – if our beloved Aurbis is
indeed naught but God’s imagination, every sentient soul the issue of some
other, could this process be recreated on a mortal scale? Could every one of you
become masters of your own realms of thought? Set yourselves into meditation, my
sons and daughters of Cyrodiil.

At this, the Oracle explodes into a brilliant golden phosphorescence, blinding
the congregation before vanishing to reveal the figure of a diminutive,
unassuming Bosmer woman.

“It isn’t just a theory, children.”
