Time in the Aurbis is a strange thing. It can be broken. It can unwind. Become
non-linear. Non-sensical.

Aka's Gift is apparently not simply a dimension of space-time.

## So What Is Time?

Time is the foundation of the Myth of Aurbis and the Universal Tale. It is the
Tale.

Before Time's birth the Spirits were only ideas, fleeting feelings, thoughts
that crossed the mind of God.

Trough Time, they became more real than that. They became part of something
greater. Action was made possible. Interaction happened.

What had been related concepts became beings, _people_, who fougth, loved and
created.

From vague ideas arose a story.

That story is the Aurbis.

And Akatosh's gifts are the conventions of causality and linearity that allow
this story to take place. Each Spirit given a past, present and future for them
to create. Law's that govern the interaction of the individual, disparate
stories.

And now, one central Law that allows the ultimate Tale to tell itself. The
Spirit Law AdaMantia, the foundation of Mundus.
