The minor house of Varyon was at one time a close rival to the Dagoths but its
ultimate fate was destined to obscurity.

The house of Varyon was a small clan of about four families that lived in the
upper regions of Vvardenfell it comprised the Varyons who were the leading
family for a long time, it also included the families of Favel, Orethi, and
Sarethi. the Favels were the second most important family and at times were the
leading family in the clan.

The ancestral home of the house and their seat of power was set in the northern
region of Vvardefell in what is now called the Ashlands, and specifically in the
fortress of Valenvaryon.

In its heyday the minor house fought for dominance of the region with what came
to be the sixth house of Dagoth, eventually losing and being assimilated into
the sixth house, but after what came to be of their liege house the survivors
renounced the sixth house after the events of red mountain, and were mostly
assimilated into the other great houses.

And although the minor house still held to its noble roots, it eventually fell
into obscurity and eventually faded away, the only remaining traces of this once
honourable house was the smuggler in Ald’ruhn known as Drinar Varyon and his
sister Dovrosi, the other families did not fare any better in the end they all
fell into obscurity and were considered commoners by the other great houses.
