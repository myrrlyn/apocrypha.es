Councilor Arano,

It has come to the attention of House Indoril that it has come to the attention
of House Redoran, that Lleril Morvayn, esteemed First Councilor of Raven Rock is
engaged in harassment of the Imperial Princess Vittoria Vici. May the
Reclamations forbid that sycophants in Blacklight keep the esteemed Councilor
Morvayn from expressing himself! This is a kind of behavior House Indoril and
the Temple encourages in all of Morrowind’s most pious and honorable sons and
daughters. Should such action continue, not only should Lleril Morvayn consider
his actions as sanctioned by us, the most august of the Great Houses, should he
meet with tangible success, we are prepared to make up the difference in budget
and foodstuffs that the Redoran leadership is currently seeing fit to deny you.

Mistress Garyn Indoril, Second Councilor, Mournhold

Garyn,

Go plough your own face, you duplicitous N’wah.

Cheers,

Arano.

Vittoria,

Once upon a time, it seems some shenanigans occurred between the daughters of
some very wealthy Reachmen landowners and two legionnaires, an Orc and a Dunmer.
One night, the two legionnaires were seen going into the house and soon after,
the whole family was dead. I asked knowledgeable parties in the city of stone
about it, but they said that the Imperial Legion military police officer who
investigated found a house full of corpses, the two legionnaires, a great deal
of blood…and even more silver.

The investigator was offered a huge sum for his silence by certain powerful
interests. He declined, attempted to continue, and the Imperial Legion opted to
discharge all three soldiers on grounds of mental exhaustion. Not long after,
the Spectres arrived to suppress the whole affair. Yet, the two legionnaires
were gone. The investigations officer was spared a visit from the Spectres by
the intervention of his commanding officer, a newly appointed Cyrodiilic
General, who pulled some strings with the EEC, and got the officer appointed as
the captain of the Redoran Guard.

Regards,

-Vendil.

First Emissary,

This island is like an overripe peach; plump, ripe, and oh so juicy.

And ready to burst.

I have contained herein the first of several dossiers on assets and individuals
of note that all operatives should keep careful watch on.

-Third Emissary Ancarion

THALMOR DOSSIER: Modyn Veleth

STATUS: Potential Asset (Observation only)

DESCRIPTION: Male Dunmer, over 200. Captain of the Redoran Guard, Raven Rock.
Imperial Legion Veteran.

BACKGROUND: Modyn Veleth was born in Blacklight in the closing years of the
Third Era. He originally planned to enter the heathen temple of Morrowind, to
join the Buoyant Armigers. He fought in the war against the An-Xileel,
eventually commanding over 100 men. However, after the war, he decided to
relocate to Solstheim. He opted to make a career in the Redoran Guard and served
well until 4E 95. In 4E 95, he personally made the high profile arrest of Vilur
Ulen, a rebel who had attempted the assassination of Lleril Morvayn. However, he
evidently upset someone powerful and eventually received demotion for his
efforts. Afterward, he wandered to Skyrim and sold his sword throughout the
province for some twenty years, before enlisting in the legion 117. Veleth was
eventually transferred into the Imperial Watch, where he earned the rank of
Captain. Still serving during the war against the Empire, he was eventually
posted to Markarth shortly after the Legion’s restoration in that city in
4E 176. He was involved in a very serious criminal investigation which was not
concluded in favor of his findings. When ordered to abandon his investigation,
Veleth declined, and it was only thanks to his friend, General Tullius, that the
Captain avoided a visit from the Spectres. He returned to Solstheim and was
granted the captaincy of the Redoran Guard.

OPERATIONAL NOTES: Completely fitting into typical _‘pure soldier’_ stereotypes,
Veleth has never shown any sympathy toward Thalmor ideals or objectives. As
such, he is best dealt with from a distance. His value lies in other areas. He
maintains a regular correspondence with General Tullius. The two were wartime
friends, and Tullius got Veleth out of trouble in Markarth. If Tullius’ present
momentum continues, in order to prolong the civil war in Skyrim, we shall have
to deal with him; when this time comes, we should consider what gems Captain
Veleth has to offer us in this area. Moreover, Veleth’s service in the Imperial
Watch has granted him access to a wealth of contacts in the Imperial City and in
Markarth. He maintains a cool relationship with Adril Arano, who does not
appreciate Veleth’s ties to General Tullius nor his interference in the safety
of Morvayn. Veleth’s record shows that while he is capable, he is prone to
clashing with authorities; we should consider using this.

Vendil,

This is cryptic, but informative. These two may turn out to be useful. Make sure
you keep close tabs on these two and ensure that if needs be, we can make use of
them.

Lady Cindiri Arano,

I received your letter recently and I was quite moved by your pleas. I
understand that you wish to leave Solstheim for somewhere less rustic…perhaps
Blacklight or maybe Solitude? This can, of course, be arranged and I am ever
happy to help a lady of fine stock who wishes to rise in station. In return, I
merely ask that you keep me apprised of the whereabouts and goings of both
Captain Modyn Veleth and my dear old friend, Councilor Morvayn. Do this, and you
shall find in me and in the East Empire Company, a steadfast and reliable
friend.

Yours truly,

Vittoria Vici.

---

Adril,

Might you consider couching your letters in more conciliatory terms, next time?

Dralis Rorlen

---

Second Emissary Ancarion,

That’s quite the gem you sent me. Do keep them coming. As we have no current
need of him in Skyrim, I’m sending the embassy’s head of assassinations,
J’datharr, to assist you with your work. He should be able to help with finding
that Stalhrim. I’m told he’s able to convincingly play the part of wandering
peddler.

Regards,

First Emissary Elenwen.

---

Mogrul,

Let us be clear. You and your associate have quite the history with the good
Captain Veleth. He has quite the history with you. It seems we can help each
other. Should you help me find Stalhrim, I will bankroll your loan venture. You
will then be in a position to aid me in extracting information from Veleth’s
correspondence. And this information may turn out to be useful in tearing down
General Tullius, the man who happens to be the shield of Modyn Veleth. Meet me
at Northshore Landing. And keep quiet.

Regards,

Ancarion

---

Vittoria,

Captain Veleth and Councilor Morvayn both seem to be invested in watching the
two newcomers to the island; Mogrul and Slitter. But it seems that from what I
have gleaned from correspondence between Morvayn and Veleth, that the two
newcomers are now having regular meetings with a certain Ancarion, in the north
of the island. Can my husband and I return to Morrowind now? Or can we go to
Solitude? Or the Imperial City?

Yours in friendship,

Cindiri Arano

---

Vendil,

I am wondering if I can trust that you have the competence to look after our
interests on Solstheim. This should not be hard. The island is not a big place,
but in the short time between our correspondences, the two assets I tasked you
to watch have decided to take up with Ancarion, a High Ranking Thalmor officer
on the island. It quite escapes me how this fits within the very broad
parameters of ‘protecting our interests’. Consider this a formal EEC warning,
lest your sad little…_‘project’_ on the island becomes history.

-Vittoria

---

Maven,

I think Vittoria has become…unsympathetic…to our interests. I think it would be
best if the company took a new…direction? As invested as I am at the moment, I
am hesitant to call in another writ from the Tong, so if you could handle this
through…other avenues…I would be quite grateful. Besides, I’m certain the
company is aware who should be the next CEO of the Skyrim office. You’ll have my
vote. You might have to leave that skeeverhole you live in, but I don’t think
that would be too much to suffer, would it?

Regards,

Vendil

---

Vendil,

Calling Riften- and my house- a skeeverhole? Such a brave little grey fellow you
are. The last man to do that directly to me, I very nearly had killed. Then I
married him. Har har! I will do this, but I assure you that the costs will be
commensurate to the risks of playing with the Brotherhood and the Tong.

Regards,

Maven
