In a nordic village, there was a cemetery, much smaller than the one in
Falkreath. It felt like I was close to High Hrothgar, yet far from it. I was
kind of curious, so I cast a detect life spell and two graves shone. One of the
plaques said “Almalexia” and the other said “The Iron Queen”.

I started to remove the stones and I swear to Akatosh it was her, it was the
grave of Almalexia, it looked like her, pointy ears and all.

I went to tell people and soon there were travelers all around curious to see
the dead body of the living godess.

I started to investigate why her body would be there, and somehow I came across
this book. It said that in the 3E 300, there lived a queen that was called
Almalexia, named after the godess. She was very inexperienced and became victim
of her court, which planned her death.

I didn’t know whether to believe that, but the travellers seemed to believe the
book and stopped coming.

The coffin was made of a weak material, and I could see inside. I took a last
look at the corpse and I swear she looked right int my soul!

— I AM THE FACE-SNAKED QUEEN OF THE THREE IN ONE. I GIVE YOU THIS EGG, AND YOU
SHALL HOLD TO IT UNTIL MYSTERY COMES.

What was that all about? I don’t know, I just closed the coffin and ran away.
Then I woke up and there was an egg right next to my bed…
