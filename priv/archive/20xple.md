The concept in the title doesn’t need elaboration. Let me explain how I think it
works.

Thanks to MK for the recent “mind blown” paradigm shift, and also
TorchicBlaziken for “going there”.

For many reasons, I’ve come to conclude that the cosmos is misunderstood. The
sky IS Aetherius, and the ocean IS Oblivion. Rather, the surface of the water
represents the barrier between the Anu and Padomay. Though this is a
metaphorical barrier, TES is weird, and the barrier itself remains literal.

The following is from the _Monomyth_ describing the Yokudan creation account:
“Pretty soon the spirits on the skin-ball started to die, because they were very
far from the real world of Satakal. And they found that it was too far to jump
into the Far Shores now.”

The Yokudans believed in a thing called Walkabout whereby the gods would walk
between Kalpas and escape their endings.

I believe that walkabout became impossible after the creation of Mundus, which
inaugurated time, ended the cycle of Kalpas, and resulted in Amaranth.

Because of Amaranth, there could be no more Kalpic cycles. But there was a _New_
Amaranth, I’m not sure I understand.

The point is that I imagine that instead of Kalpas you now have timelines. While
timelines can change and vary internally, Amaranth creates new timelines.

Yokuda was the final Kalpic Cycle. Lorkhan the sea serpent ATE Yokuda and the Ra
Gada were those that escaped. They _tried_ Walkabout, but for the reasons
described in _Monomyth_ the far shores were too far now that Amaranth had
happened and Mundus was created. Their “Walkabout” ended with them arriving on
the shores of Tamriel. Plain and simple.

Tamriel itself is no constant. Jungles, not jungles, etc. But the New Amaranth
features Akavir. One assumes that if the pre-Amaranth featured timeless Kalpas
and post-Amaranth featured a timeline, then post-New Amaranth must be something
totally weird.

I don’t know what it would be. But I’m calling these “Amaranth phases”
“sousrealities”.

Yes, Nirn appears as a sphere sometimes. But the reality is that it’s weird and
cosmic and the sea surface is a tangible manifestation of a metaphysical,
metaphorical phenomenon, and travel across it, down into it, and up above it all
have weird consequences.

ADDENDUM:

Atmora, in this light, would be the collective experience of mankind prior to
Mundus. Man, as the servants of Shor, existed upon the primordial seas. This
existence _is_ Atmora. The migration to Tamriel is the literal/figurative
migration of man into time and reality. The fact that dragons reached backwards,
err, Northwards to Atmora is just part of Akatosh filling out reality forwards
and back. When Mundus was created, past worlds were consumed into the new
creation. This is why, by the time of Talos, Atmora is no longer a place you can
go to. Because reality is pretty firm and bound to time.

Aldmeris would be a similar thing for the elves. This means that men and mer
precede Tamriel, so their settlement of it represents Akatosh pulling more and
more of the past into the present, in binding. It also means that Tamriel could
have had its own races of men and mer, and these are they who fought directly at
convention. Snow Elves/Nedes? Shor would be a memory from Atmora. Sovngarde
would hold souls in walkabout in preservation for the great fight at convention.
Shezzar was Shor that actually fought, and it is the Nedes that remember him
better. In other words, the Nords are men as they were before Tamriel,
anticipating it, then forced to colonize it due to Akatosh. Nedes are the men
that died with Lorkhan, subsumed later by mer and Nord.

But that’s just speculation.

FINAL ADDENDUM:

The inversion. The waters circled the air, then Amaranth happened, and the air
encircled the waters. That’s how it happened.
