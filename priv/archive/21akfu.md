I’ve been meaning to get to this ever since that comment, because I believe MK
was hinting at something. The Tsaesci Creation Myth is perhaps the only equal to
the Redguard Creation Myth in terms of its complexity and enigmatic language,
for reasons MK has recently elaborated on.

This follows the C0DA of Akavir being the new dream. If you don’t follow this
C0DA, that’s fine, but I say this as a disclaimer in case someone walks away
with the wrong idea.

Let’s begin.

Here we see the mention of Twelve Worlds, a similarity with the Anuad. It could
be that the creation of Akavir shared similarities with that of Anu’s dream. It
could be that this is the Akavir equivalent of the Anuad, but I’m not certain of
this.

The mention of serpents “coiling into themselves and became more eggs” sort of
supports this. The context of Naming and its implications of identity leads me
to believe this is a period similar to when the Anui-el was contemplating his
existence. They’re searching themselves, creating subgradients so they can
understand themselves. More “snakes”, or spirits, are created in the process.

The last two sentences are very perplexing. The rest of the first paragraph
draws clear parallels to the Aurbis creation event, but here we see that there
is personified “Random Sequence” discovered that the creation of new concepts
leaned towards “the Left Eye”, which may be an Anu The Everything equivalent.
“Variation Realms” suggests that the “Random Sequence”, who is perhaps a Sithis
figure, saw that there was too much stasis and uniformity. He sought to create
different things rather than the inbred concept breeding of the serpents.

Thus we can draw clear similarities to the Aurbis creation event from the first
paragraph.

> There was the Biting, which broke the twelve worlds and their name-eggs, and
> the Biters chewed new names of the lesser serpents until soon death was known
> to the smallest and your alphabets disappeared but ours did not. The state of

Here things become more cryptic. The Biting makes some sense as an event similar
to when Padomay shattered the Twelve Worlds with Lorkhan, but that clearly isn’t
the whole story. There is a divergence.

We see that there is not one Lorkhan figure but many; not one Biter but multiple
Biters. They halt the process of inbred concept creation.

But what “inbred concepts” were they stopping? Remnants from the previous Dream.
This is the first time that the myth directly speaks to what is presumed to be
someone from Tamriel. The Biters destroyed the previous “alphabet”, the formula
from which concepts are created. They’re rejecting Tamriel’s ideas and
substituting their own.

“The state of rest” may refer to an Anuic ideal, and given that Anu was the
previous Dreamer, became something “worthy of blame”. It was limited and some of
the blame went to the Right Eye, the Padomaics responsible for the Biting.

The Tsaesci creator beings, being the Snake Ninjas they are, possibly recreated
some of these concepts out of pity(and for their own nefarious purposes) for the
presumably sizable population of Tamrielic people who were going to arrive in
Akavir someday. These are the “Otherkin” Tosh Raka refers to in his [decree][0].
Obviously, he is not pleased.

I believe this is the root of the Tsaesci vs Po Tun conflict. Tosh Raka doesn’t
want any of Tamriel’s concepts. He wants to kick off his parent’s past and forge
his own path. The Tsaesci, on the other hand, want to keep the past dreams. The
“Men of Akavir” are the “transient food-forms”, the left overs from a past
dream. This is why they “ate the Men of Akavir”. They were protecting them.

This is notable because it implies the Dreamer _is not omnipotent_. Otherwise
Tosh Raka would have succeeded in taking out the Tsaesci a long time ago and
would have invaded Tamriel. He’s strong, but I believe that he has to interact
through a dream avatar. Since his original avatar wasn’t strong enough to take
out the Tsaesci, he invented a Dragon Style and upgraded himself into an awesome
Kung Fu Time Dragon God.

It’s possible Anu could have done something similar and taken a more active role
in his dream, but he was too busy fighting off Dream!Padomay.

The “scales moving freely” are fragments of a greater spirit descending and
becoming the “Gift-limbs” of Akavir. However, some of Tamriel began bleeding in.
The “twelve-to-one” refers to how Anu formed Nirn from the remnants of the
Twelve Worlds. It was unsense, something too crazy even for the Tsaesci, so they
silenced it the only way they could.

It should be noted that the Biters turned on the random sequence, implying that
they are more animalistic than Lorkhan was or had reason to turn on it. I
suspect something happened there that is mentioned in a different Akaviri
creation myth.

Regardless of why, the Tsaesci eventually came and stopped the poison biting.
They all began to sing the music, creating their own Aurbis. This is the Trumpet
Season, the time when the music is being established. I imagine the Music of the
Ainur from Tolkien’s Ainulindale would be an apt comparison.

We see a fundamental philosophy emerge in this time: Honor or Moderation? I
imagine that this is similar to the Padomaic vs Anuic debate of the previous
dream, but different in some ways.

We can see that the Po Tun lean toward the path of Honor. They honor Tosh Raka
above all, who is a radical dreamer that cannot stand any concept not his own.
The Tsaesci, on the other hand, are Ninjas. Honor is an obstacle to them. They
prefer Moderation instead, which may explain why they try to preserve elements
from the past dreams. It also might explain why they took the time to actually
visit Tamriel whereas the other cultures haven’t.

The Kamal, I believe, represent the absence of both. They’re brutal barbarians
who care nothing for civilization of any sort. The Tsaesci may not be honorable,
but even they realize the necessity of some rules for civilization.

Now we see the creation of something like Oblivion. The name eggs who barely got
away without being turned into “calculation powder” (likely an Earthbone
equivalent) settled and became “dreugh-waters”, a term heavily associated with
the Daedra. Is it a change brought in by the Tsaesci Ancestor Spirits? Maybe.

Here is likely an event where their creation was in a flux state like the Dawn
Era. They sneakily introduced some old ideas to the mix by naming an egg and
making the waters move as they wish.

The “dead names” are likely old concepts that the Tsaesci tricked into the
dream, and the alphabet-virus was their asymmetric weapon against the Dreamer to
alter things to their wishes.

Naturally, the Tsaesci used this opportunity to pull an inverse Lorkhan. They
didn’t surrender their divinity to empower their planet; they used the planet’s
creation to become immortal. “Past the star line” refers to Tamriel.

And here the scheme is pulled off. The Tsaesci were integral to Akavir’s
creation, altering it in subtle ways that benefited them. They are dominated by
no one and assimilate all, which is why they couldn’t resist including some of
Tamriel’s ideas.

I believe “Tsaescence” is the name of their chief Martial Art, which was woven
into the fabric of creation. The Music is in tune with this style, which may be
why it is so powerful.

They “ate” (internalized) the style, and “became” the style, which is how they
became the Snake Men. “There are no more variations” because the Tsaesci view
Tsaescence as the highest form of martial arts, and won’t accept any other
alternative. Hence their trouble when Tosh Raka dreams up his dragon style.

This necessitates the Dragonguard’s trip to Tamriel. They come to alter
Tamriel’s history so that they can sneak these ideas into the creation of
Akavir, which in turn grants them power.

This is the Akaviri Dragonguards plan. They believe that if they can support
certain ideas in Tamriel(Dragons are bad, go Dragonborn!), they can sneak them
into Akavir’s dream.

This would allow them to write into existence their own version of a Dragonborn,
someone who would be able to take down Tosh Raka once and for all. They would
then have absolute control over Akavir.

Their snake imagery has some to do with Lorkhan, I believe, because the Tsaesci
are for Creation. They wanted a Mundus. However, the reason for their snake-like
forms is primarily as an outward expression of the philosophy of Tsaesance.

The Tsaesci are a sneaky, devious lot. They’re willing to time travel all the
way to a previous dream to have a shot at beating one of their enemies. They
aren’t opposed to dirty tricks and they never, ever fight fair. Above all, they
are followers of Tsaescence, with all that implies.
