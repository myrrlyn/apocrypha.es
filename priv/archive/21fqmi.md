[Part I][0]

I promise nothing about the clarity of Part II before you’ve read Part I! This
is an expansion of ideas found in the first.

## Nagging Question Answered

Where did Memory go? That was the nagging question. In an earlier thread, I
suggested that Memory literally went to Akavir, since it was the light of the
new Dream, and east is where new days dawn. I later backed off of that, along
with the idea of Trans-Amaranth travel, but I think I was actually onto
something. Memory literally went with the Flower Baby into its new Dream.

This is not because Anu’s Akavir is identical with Tosh Raka’s Akavir. Dream B
and Dream C remain separate Amaranths without conventional joined borders. More
on this in a bit.

Rather, Memory left _with(in)_ the Flower Baby, who later took the shape of Tosh
Raka within Dream C based on what it found in Memory about the big shots in
Dream B’s Akavir. That is, Memory joined with or entered the Flower Baby as it
left to forge its own form within the Godhead.

And, since Memory’s departure was the cause of the infinite c0da digressions,
that leaves room for each c0da to form its own internal Memory, which would also
depart if that c0da produces an Amaranth, splitting into yet another infinity of
variations.

## Trans-Amaranth Travel

Remember how I said the Amaranths don’t share conventional borders? Typically we
think of borders as physical lines we cross, or abstractions of those lines,
laid over geography. I maintain that crossing geographical borders does not
allow Trans-Amaranth travel.

But there may be a different kind of border, that allows a different kind of
crossing. We’ve discussed before that Amaranths have symbolic overlaps. See
here:

> - dream A = Yokuda of myth + unknown Tamriel + unknown Akavir
> - dream B = remembered Yokuda + Tamriel we know + Akavir we know
> - dream C = remembered Yokuda + Remembered Tamriel + Unknown Akavir.

What else do these Dreams have in common? Well, the omnipresent laws of the
Godhead, certainly. And I think that’s enough to get Trans-Amaranth travel.

Imagine sailing to Dream B’s Akavir. There you are, in a symbol of the future,
having crossed the ocean, a symbol of the Godhead. You’re not in Dream C. Not
yet. But what if you knew that Dream C existed? What if you had knowledge of the
Godhead, of CHIM and Amaranth; what then?

I think, as long as the Akavir of Dream C were sufficiently similar to the
symbol-Akavir of Dream B (based on the lineage of Memory), that the resemblance
could be formed into a bridge between the two. If you knew enough about Will,
and Love, and the Godhead and its contents, you could trick/convince/Will the
Godhead into placing you in both Dreams at once (possible because the Godhead’s
laws are present in both). Then, you’d just back off of your presence in Dream
B, and there you are. You just traveled from a progenitor Dream to its progeny
Dream. Maybe you’re slightly different due to the changes in physics between the
two, but hey, close enough.

This should not be thought of as mere time traversal! It is _reality_ traversal.
But, because realities have sequential lineage through Memory, it can have the
timetravel-like effects described by threads like [this one][1].
