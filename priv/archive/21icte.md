## 23rd Second Seed, 2E 582

Addressed to her highness, Clivia Tharn, Empress Regent of Cyrodiil. May the
Eight bless you till the end.

When we last spoke, you requested that I, Quintillius Trebates, would venture
out on your behalf, to the wilds of the Starry Heart and record the songs and
sonnets played by the uncivilized citizens of this land.

The previous corresspondence from myself detailled the hymns sung by the Nords
of Skyrim, sung in the tongue of the dragons, telling of a dark day when Alduin
would return and rule over their land once more. I was told that you most
enjoyed it, and I now tell of the cats of Elsweyr.

I was taken from the white stoned walls of Rimmen along the badlands towards the
city of Orcrest. The caravan I took was led by a young Dagi-raht, who sang this
ballad as we rode.

```verse
O, Jone and Jode, look down on me,
And help this cat stay warm.
When Alkosh can’t, and Lorkhaj won’t,
Help this cat stay warm.
Khenarthi’s Roost is cast ablaze,
It’s helped this cat stay warm.
```

The Dagi-raht told me the song is about a Khajiit’s struggles to stay warm in
the desert at night, and warn of the sack of Khenarthi’s Roost that would happen
if the Maormer were allowed to stay on the isle.

I hope when you read this missive, you will find it enjoyable enough to
commision me more gold to fund my adventures. Until then, may the Divines keep
you safe in these trecharous times.
