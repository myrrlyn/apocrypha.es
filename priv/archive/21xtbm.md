On the Isle of Betony in the Illiac Bay, the first day of Rain's Hands holds a
special place in the hearts of the Breton population of the island.

In the forty-third year of the Common Era, a group of travelling entertainers
named “_Sheggorath's Soirée_” visited the city of Kerekbeth, and set up their
stalls outside the city's gates. The citizens were more than excited to see the
harlequins come to their part of Heiroc, and spent their gold freely, happy to
have an excuse to abandon their hard work for a short time.

Eventually, the Baron of Kerekbeth heard of his people slacking, and sent out
the city guard to round up the jesters and bring them to the castle for his own
pleasure.

Now,_“Sheggorath's Soirée”_ were used to dealing with common folk and not the
higher echelons of society, and were understandably nervous when they were in
front of the Baron. They performed their routine, which included pulling a
skeever from a hat, sawing a wench in half and making one of the many mistresses
of the Baron disappear.

The noble, although satisfied to see the ugliest of his wenches be gone, was not
happy with the jesters act. He ordered them to perform something so dangerous,
Vaermina's nightmares could not rival it.

The group huddled together in deep discussion, and gulped with nerves when they
turned back to face the Baron.

The leader of the pack pulled out a baton that was cloaked in boar fat and
announced he would set it alight, then swallow it while blindfolded.

He proceeded with his act, but panicked when he dropped the baton and set the
carpet ablaze, sending the other jesters into a frenzy of screeches, which in
turn sent the Baron into a barrel of laughter.

When he had finished and wiped the tears from his eyes, he proclaimed the party
the best in the land, and said that from that day on, every first day of Rain's
Hand shall be celebrated as “The Festival of Fools” and that everyone in
Kerekbeth should have a day of rest in honour of “_Sheggorath's Soirée_” and
enjoy the joy that laughter brings at the misfortune of others.
