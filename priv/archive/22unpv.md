## Chapter 1 Part 1

### Jehanna, High Rock

#### 3st of Morning Star, 35th year of the Fourth Era

It was a usual winter night in Jehanna. King Skjalfnir was holding his usual
meeting in his throneroom. His most trusted Thanes, and important Lords were
there; and as usual a feast was held in his majesty’s honor. During the middle
of the meal King Skjalfnir asked “Lord Fellwis, what news do you have for me
today?” The Old Lord replied “Well milord the winter drought has affected the
people’s food supplies greatly. The average family is down to three maybe two
loaves of bread a day. Our kands have become barren. Trading with the west has
become harder, all land routes to Skyrim are either blocked off or in reachman
territory. I think it’d be better if we started trade relations with…” “With
whom?” Thane Bjarug rudely interrupts, “Those pompous milk-drinkers you call
Kings?! No. A man’s mead is only as good as the man wo made it.We expand our
lands not beg for the fruit of others. We must invade Farrun at once!” Skjalfnir
agreeingly said “Ha! those weak Bretons will never stand a chance against a
superior Nordic army.”

Lord Fellwis was evidently shocked by Skjalfnir’s eagerness to start a war with
the West, so he tried to convince him otherwise, “But Sir! A war with Farrun
would not be in the best interest of the Emperor! it would enrage the Court of
Kings and possibly…” Fellwis was interrupted by Prince Asgeir before he could
finish. Asgeir was holding a blade towards Fellwis’ throat and became too afraid
to talk. Asgeir then turned to his father and said “Father, if war is necessary
then I shall proudly show these Bretons what Nordic steel tastes like.” Asgeir
looked intimidatingly to Fellwis and said “If you’d like father, I could show
you how I plan to do so.” “Ha! By Talos!” Skjalfnir merrily replied “My boy you
got a lot of work ahead of you then. Can you imagine? You’re yet to be a king
yet you already speak as if you were one!” Skjalfnir turns his attention to Lord
Fellwis and says “As for Fellwis; let him live. He can watch as we burn High
Rock to the ground, besides I just got new rugs from hammerfell and I don’t want
any blood on it.

As the small celebration starts, a hooded man stands in a corner watching as it
all traspired. Later the man leaves the castle into the cold city streets. He
goes on through the city gates and heads West.

### Ganvadon, High Rock

#### 5rd of Morning Star, 35th year of the Fourth Era

It was a normal day in the town of Ganvadon, people lived their normal lives
until something not so uncommon happened. The townspeople saw a horde of around
three dozen running towards the village. The people are all too familiar with
the situation and head towards safety. In an attempt to protect the town the
town guard form a phalanx facing the horde, while archers positioned themselves
on the rooftops.

As the town guard waited for the enemy to charge into their pikes the Guard
Captain cried “Brace yourselves men! Show no remorse, for you will be given
none! One of the rooftop archers alerted the men captain of the enemies numbers,
“Sir! there’s about three dozen of ‘em, and one really big armored orc fella.”
That ain’t an orc ye dumb lout” said another guard, “It’s a fucking Ogre!.” Upon
hearing this the Captain panicked and cried “Archers! bring down the fat one,
NOW!”

The Archers responded quickly and sent a hail of arrows towards the ogre. It
appears as if the combination of the orcish armor and the ogre’s thick skin
absorbed all the damage. The ogre just continued rushing towards the formation
of men sweeping their spears so that they point away from the incoming charge,
making that part of the formation relatively vulnerable. The Orcs exploited this
weak spot and focused their troops there. The once orderly Breton spear phalanx
was now nothing but a group of divided men desperately fighting to survive.
Archers could not provide much support; for fear of shooting at their allies.
After several minutes of battle; the sound of an imperial battlehorn could be
heard from a distance. The combatants stop their battle and look towards the
source of the sound. An entire cohort of Legion Soldiers, led by General
Licinius, were marching down the hill towards Ganvadon. The Orcs disengage from
the battle and run back to the mountains; all but one.

“What is the meaning of all this?!” said General Licinius, “Can’t a man have a
stroll in this country without ever catching a battle in action? And aren’t you
all aware that your oaths to the Empire prevent this type of infighting?!”
“G-General, it was not our fault” the guard captain nervously said, “This Orc
and his friends came charging into our town! We had no choice but to defend
ourselves!” The Guard Captain points to the tall muscular orc who remained in
the battlefield, and is currently facing the other direction. General Licinius
turned to the orc and said “You there! Green skin! What say you in your defense
against this man’s accusation?” The Orc turns around and looks at Licinius’ face
with a menacing grin; Licinius shows a bit of shock and it is obvious that he
recognizes his face.

“Well, well. well.” said Licinius, “Kazakhan, King of the Orcs. Why am I not
surprised to see you mixed up in all this mess?”

“General Licinius” Kazakhan replied, “last time I saw you, you and your men were
running back to Cyrodiil after losing a skirmish with one of my armies.”

Licinius replies sarcastically “Funny you should mention that Kazakhan, I just
saw one of your armies running away from a battle you were winning! Who’s more
of a coward now, eh?”

Kazakhan replies with a hint of anger “My men weren’t running to save their
lives Licinius, they were running to save yours.”

The Guard Captain now becoming impatient asks the General Lucinius “Are you just
going to stand there and make jokes? Do something for the Divine’s sake!”

“Well Kazakhan, as much as I hate to say it; I’m not here to visit. You were
violating the Empire’s satrapy laws.” Said Licinius.

“Oh what a shame” Kazakhan sarcastically replied.

“And as Empire law states you must either face punishment for your actions, or
pay a fee in gold.” stated Licinius.

“Listen here General, the Imperial satrapy law states that we must pay IF we
attack another satrapy. Me and my men were hunting a pack of wild lions, we saw
them head down the mountain path this way so we pursued them. Is that a crime in
Imperial law?” argued Kazakhan.

“Yes Kazakhan that is what you say” argued Licinius, “But what of these dead
Bretons and Orcs, hmm? They seem to show otherwise.”

“We didn’t attack first Licinius,” said Kazakhan, “these Bretons fired at one of
my men. We were fighting in self-defence. Perhaps it should be me asking the
King of Wayrest for compensation?”

“Haha” Licinius laughed, “You’re a comedian Kazakhan. You honestly think I will
fall for your lies?”

“Will your emperor believe a band of a mere three dozen orcs took down ten dozen
well-equipped Breton soldiers?” asked Kazakhan.

“There was also an Ogre in his army” added a guardsman. “Be quiet soldier” The
Guard Captain said.

“I’ll let you go this time Kazakhan; but remember this is your last warning.”
stated Licinius “If I see you picking another fight with anyone of the Kingdoms,
you’re going to pay.”

As Kazakhan starts walking away he grins and says “You’re a comedian Licinius.
You said it was my last warning, ten warnings ago.”

### Farrun, High Rock

#### 8th of Morning Star, 35th year of the 4th Era

Late at night in Farrun, a Snowstorm makes it hard to see past 10 feet. The
Gateguard in the city see a man approaching from the west road, he holds no
torch or anything just his hooded robes and a walking staff. As standard
protocol the Guards approach the man to ask some questions. “Halt there sir.
What is your business here?” asked a guard. “Leswell is expecting me” said the
man. The guard apparently in shock asks the hooded man, “A-are you the…” “Yes
I’am” says the man “Now let me through, I must speak to the duke.” The hooded
man enters the city and heads straight towards the Palace.

In the duke’s room a servant comes knocking at the door, trying to wake up the
duke. “Sir? Sir? wake up sir!” said the servant. “What is it this time?” said
the Duke Leswell, “Don’t you know what time it is?! Obviously not or else you
wouldn’t be bothering me.” As the duke opens the door he asks the servant one
more time, “What do you want? It’s late at night and I need my sleep.” “Sir, he
has returned” said the servant almost enthusiastically. “Well that took longer
than I expected, way longer. Now where is he?” Asked the Duke. “He’s in the
Throne Room right now Sir.” The duke pushed the servant away and headed towards
the throne room. “Umm don’t you need a lamp sir? it’s awfully dark in the throne
room at night.” “No need boy, I provide my own light” the Duke snapped his
fingers and a ball of light suddenly appeared and started hovering over him.

As the Duke entered the throne room he sees his visitor sitting on his throne
staring blankly at the darkness. The Duke asked Impatiently “Well?! What
happened? did you get the job done?” “No, I didn’t.” said the visitor, “but I
did something much, much better. It’s amazing what you can do with a couple of
spies in a couple of months.”

“You better hope what you did is better” said the Duke. “I’m risking way too
much for this, and you better deliver.”

“Trust me” said the mysterious visitor, “Jehanna will be yours soon enough.”
