You are I may look right, or left. The Elder Scrolls look both right and left,
_and_ through our right, _and_ our left. This false paradox is easily understood
through the flame-in-void (or fish-in-water) model as presented by Septimus
Signus in _Ruminations on the Elder Scrolls_. To summarize: we are the void and
the Scrolls the light which defines the void as self-knowing, saving it from the
unknowing-self of emptiness.

When read by a perception point of the self-seeing void, the Scrolls respond to
the perception vector of that void-point such that the vector may interact with
a currently unpredictable set of void-points (research pending).

Due to the All Sight of the Scroll, the Scroll cannot be that which changes as
they see all possible perception vectors within the Wheel. How then, is it
possible to read a Scroll, to change the Scroll into something read?

We resolve the conflict:

There can be no change in void without dependence on the unvoid of the Scroll.
Therefore, The Scroll cannot change so the void must change, and by the void
changing the Scroll is Also non-insignificantly changed (from That to
That-which-changed). Thus, only from the _consequence_ of reading is the reading
possible.

The left-right seeing of the Scroll sees no conflict, and no change. The fish
does not swim through the water, so the water must move around the fish. The
fish looks left-right and knows only all views by which the water sees it, and
so knows every angle of itself; except one.

Here is the danger of Scroll tampering: should the left-right of All Sight be
broken into left and right, the blinded Scroll might look _up_ and know the edge
of the Wheel. That way lies madness, for without the fish the water cannot move.
