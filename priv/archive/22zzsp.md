In honor of High King Jorunn of Skyrim, the Tribunal of Morrowind, and the Hist
of Black Marsh. It is through them that the Ebonheart Pact remains strong enough
to combat its enemies.

As requested, I have compiled all of my research notes along with other notes
from various works on the Barsaebic Ayleidoon and have sent them to your station
in Ebonheart. I trust these inquiries will help you in your understanding of
these enigmatic elves and the Pacts’ excursions within their ruins. I hope you
remembered the payment this time.

## The Barsaebic Ayleidoon: The Mer of Black Marsh

### Prologue

Ever since I was a hatchling, I have always been entranced with the ancient
Ayleid structures that grew up from the moist mud of my native home of
Stormhold. In my free time, I would frequently go and make stone etchings of
ruined spires and gates sprouting near my hut. My parents found me unusual
because of my fascination by them, and told me to consult the local Tree-Minder
over my ‘obsession.’ It was the old Saxhleel himself that told me the true name
of the ruins’ creatures, the Barsaebics, and forever planted the sapling of
exploration in my soul.

I have gone to many places, fought a multitude of creatures, and consulted with
persons both mundane and magical in my travels. But I was always fascinated by
the forgotten Ayleid culture of my homeland. And so, I returned to Black Marsh
and spent twenty years studying the Barsaebic culture (however, thanks to an
unique condition I caught years earlier, those years felt more like days to me).
Now, I hope that the tome that will be created by such studies will help fellow
scholars and adventurers alike for centuries to come.

### Introduction

To this very day, no one truly knows why the Ayleidoon splintered from the
Altmer of Summerset Isles, but in any case they did. It is commonly believed
that they arrived in mainland Tamriel second behind the Falmer and third behind
the Dwemer, settling within the region that would eventually become modern day
Cyrodiil. Upon their arrival, they built the spectacular White-Gold Tower (which
some link to the mysterious Celediil of _The Song of Pelinal, Volume 3: On His
Enemy_) and began to immediately enslave the indigenous tribes of men known as
the Nedes. Each of the Ayleid ruins (or some conjointly) were ruled by an Ayleid
Lord and his beliefs. Thus, some cities were more Aedra aligned or more Daedra
aligned than others. This eventually resulted in a rift within the Ayleid
hierarchy called the Narfinsel Schism (see _Ayleid Survivals in Valenwood_ for
more details), with the Ayleid Lords feuding over the ‘correct’ belief.

Life for the Ayleidoon soon became conflicted by the uprising of the female
slave Alessia, who rallied her fellow slaves and received aid from the ancient
Nordic Empire in Skyrim. However, the most deciding factor of the war came from
the Ayleid Lords themselves. Disgusted and ashamed of their Daedra-loving
brethren, the more Aedric aligned Ayleid Lords joined arms with Alessia in order
to defeat the Daedraphiles once and for all.

Said Daedraphiles viewed this as a betrayal of kin, and fought the rebellious
Lords in anger. It is around this time that the Barsaebic Ayleids are first
mentioned. Led by Aran Yarimor Labal (King Yarimor Time-Stone), these Aedraphile
Ayleidoon fought against the armies of the Daedra worshipper Aran Glinferen of
Atatar at the Scouring of Wendelbek. While they fought valiantly, the Barsaebics
proved no match for the conjured beasts of the enemy king and were forced to
flee to avoid being completely destroyed. The remnants of Yarimor’s forces (who
either mainly hailed from the Ayleid city of Barsaeb or Barsaebi; no one is
entirely sure, and the ruins have long since been destroyed) eventually found
their way to the northwest regions of Black Marsh, where they would settle until
dying out sometime at the end of the First Era.

### Section One: Barsaebic Culture and Customs

Although they had left behind the Ayleidoon of Cyrod, the Barsaebic Ayleids
continued many of their practices. Upon arrival in Black Marsh, Yarimor (who
would eventually die of his wounds from the battlefield) ordered the
construction of the traditional Ayleid architecture – half aboveground, half
underground structures made from stone and layered with magic.

However, the Barsaebics realized that the environment of the Marsh was vastly
different than the jungles (or forests? I’m pretty sure it was jungles, but
you’ll have to take that argument to someone interested in metaphysics) of
Cyrod, and consequently they adapted their culture to increase their survival.

They forsook the more heavy armor of the Cyrod Ayleids, adorning themselves in
silk clothing to negate the hot and humid temperature of Black Marsh. They also
began to journey outside their cities to hunt and domesticate wild creatures,
building aboveground pens to house to them to avoid tougher creatures from
devouring them. The Barsaebic Ayleids also took up the use of torches to scare
off beasts, leaving behind old superstitions about fire being lesser than light.
These unique mer also apparently dyed their skin a mixture of green and brown
through magical means (I learned of this from a Kothringi tribesman friend),
causing them to blend in with their new surroundings.

In a very unique way, one can say that the Barsaebics became even more primal
than the Bosmer. Abandoning much of their former civilized culture, they became
a bizarre combination of scholarly pragmatism.

### Section Two: Barsaebic Society

The Barsaebics’ society was very similar but at the same time very different
than the societies of their cousins in both Cyrodiil and Valenwood. Upon arrival
in Argonia, the Barsaebics were believed to have contacted the Kothringi to
assure that those tribes of men would not find themselves subjected to the
slavery of old. Once that matter was resolved, the Barsaebics are then to have
communed with the Hist of my people (how they did is unknown, but the Hist
itself might have sought them out) and discussed several things. After both of
these events, the Barsaebic Ayleidoon built their vast cities and kept to
themselves.

It is often thought that the Barsaebics were led by a central city, where the
Aran (King) resided. Smaller city-states led by Lords came after this, who all
reported to the Aran. Because of there closeness as a people and their common
hatred of Daedra worship, the politics and religious beliefs of the Barsaebics
remained very stable. Their small legions of trained warrior-mages never fought
against each other, and their peaceful coexistence with any outsiders was
likewise peaceful.

However, the Barsaebics seemed to have believed of themselves to be of a
different ‘ilk’ than their former brethren. A prime example of this occurred at
the infamous Battle of Glenumbria Moors, where Laloriaran Dynar (or better known
as the Last King of the Ayleids; take a look at the book of the same name by
Herminia Cinna along with _Bisnensel: Our Ancient Roots_ to learn more about
him) aided the Direnni of High Rock against the Alessians in a decisive victory.
If some records gleamed from transcriptions found within Ayleid ruins in
Valenwood can be believed, Laloriaran had sent a message to the Barsaebics for
reinforcements for his army to defeat the ever-approaching men. The Barsaebics
however refused, calling themselves ‘more than mere Ayleid’ in their returned
reply. Even though the Last King defeated the First Empire without their aid,
from that point on the remaining Ayleidoon refused to acknowledge the Barsaebics
as fellow mer.

### Section Three: Barsaebic Religion

The main reason the Barsaebics split from their brethren in Cyrodiil was over
Aedra worship, and when they arrived in Shadowfen that is the religion they
continued to uphold. It is noted that they chiefly worshipped Magnus (who they
viewed as greater than Meridia, a Daedric Prince), Trinimac, Mara, Auri-El, and
Y’ffre. It’s been stated by other scholars that the Barsaebics might have taken
up the worship of Y’ffre after their exodus into the marshes, where they became
more attuned to nature than the other Heartland Elves, but at the same time not
becoming mere shadows of the Wood Elves. The worship of Trinimac might have also
been taken up during this time.

While they have also been attributed to tribes of Kothringi and ancient Saxhleel
(this idea I personally frown down upon, but it is possible…somewhat), the
various ‘Wayshrines’ (read _Wayshrines of Tamriel_) that can be found scattered
across Shadowfen have been highly theorized to have been set up by the Barsaebic
Ayleidoon during their existence. The fact that some of the Wayshrines seem to
denote some form of reverence for the stars, which the Ayleidoon greatly
respected, helps stoke the fire of this theory (the Ayleid phrase “Av molag
anyammis, av latta magicka”; ‘From fire, life; from light, magic’ was even found
amongst the ruins of the Barsaebic Ayleids).

### Section Four: Barsaebic Relations with Non-Ayleidoon

Because of how they were forced out of their original home, the Barsaebic
Ayleids eventually converted into a slightly isolationist nature. They kept to
their stone cities, built beneath the soggy mires of Black Marsh and practiced
their hidden magicks. However, several of my excursions within forgotten Ayleid
ruins reveal ancient Kothringi, Lilmothiit, and Saxhleel tools and weaponry.
This shows that the Barsaebics might have traded with other cultures along with
my own in the past, probably in exchange for materials for their research and
crafting.

Oral traditions amongst my people also hint that the Barsaebics would fairly
often travel to Saxhleel settlements in the area and study our ways. If my
understanding of the old tales prove correct, they were interested in the way we
treated and performed magic, and spoke with our Tree-Minders into great length
on the subject. It is unknown if they did this for the Kothringi or Lilmothiit
as well, but I believe they probably did.

Studies show that contact between the Barsaebic Ayleids and the Cantemiric
Velothi were probably minimal in nature. The Cantemiric (an extremely enigmatic
and isolationist tribe of Dunmeri Ashlanders, if the term ‘Ashlander’ can even
be applied to beings living in a swamp) are believed to have been generally
hostile with everyone they met. Along with little information on them – as well
as their dying out sometime in the early Second Era – we can never truly know
what kind of relationship the Cantemiric had with the Barsaebics.

Their relationship with the other Ayleids can be neatly summed in one word:
intolerance. When the First Empire began to persecute the remaining of the
Ayleidoon still in Old Cyrod, many believed that the Barsaebics would give them
shelter within the almost impenetrable marshes of their new home. However, the
Barsaebics refused them entry and drove them away. The most famous of these
Ayleid exodus to Black Marsh was done by the Atatarics, who foolishly believed
that their old enemies would allow them into their sacred halls. The Barsaebics
met them at their settlement in Stormhold, and promptly routed them back west.
The fate of the Atatarics is unknown, but it is believed most of them were
killed upon entering ancient Elsweyr. Because of this isolationism, the
Ayleidoon that fled to Valenwood began to contribute the word ‘Barsaebic’ with
the word ‘swamp’, and some ancient transcribed texts even refer to the
Barsaebics as the ‘Swamp Elves’.

### Conclusion

The Barsaebic Ayleids were a strange, but interesting offshoot from the Ayleids
of Cyrodiil. This is prevalent in that others of their kind even began to refer
to them as the Marsh Elves, in sharp contrast to the Heartland Elves. Their
decline was largely on their small population, resulting in them fading into the
pages of obscurity like the brethren they came to view as strangers. However,
many of their relics have been left behind in my native home of Shadowfen, which
to this day our still used to study their magnificent culture.

I hope that this guide will aid in the excavations and studying of Ayleid ruins
within Black Marsh, which seems to have become an interesting side project of
the Pact. As I promised, I have also sent the appropriate texts along with this
pamphlet that helped me in its compiling.
