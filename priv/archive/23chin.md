If anyone discovers this journal, take note that these are the words of Gunnar,
son of Jarl Bronjar the Seer of Snowhawk.

2 Hearth Fire

It has been five days since these so called _Gates to Oblivion_ have been
appearing all over Skyrim. The daedra that spawned from the Deadlands have so
far kept to themselves, which is unnerving the population moreso than if they
were raping and pillaging them. I have orded the people to move to the fort if
the daedra advance towards the city and to not attempt to make contact with the
monsters.

6 Hearth Fire

The Legion deserted us and went back to Cyrodiil as soon as news of Emperor
Uriel’s death broke, and we have been worse off for it. We have sent for help
from Solitude and Dawnstar, but Thian and Macalla have let our pleas fall on
deaf ears thus far. I fear worse is yet to come.

8 Hearth Fire

The walls have been breeched.

Snowhawk is lost.
