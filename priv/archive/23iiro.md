Among other things, Riften is a dumping ground for the unwanted of society. War,
famine, or simple neglect leave many children on its harsh and unforgiving
streets. Not even the passing Pilgrim of Stendarr stops to pay attention to
them. As far as he is concerned – as far as Skyrim society as a whole is
concerned – the homeless and orphaned are bait, to be devoured by or assimilated
into the ever-growing criminal element. Little solace is to be found in such a
life.

With the advent of the Dragonborn, however, new life has been breathed into the
near-invisible subculture of street children. Anywhere in today’s Riften, the
sights of children sharing stories with each other or praying in imitation of
the Priests of Mara are common. What has sparked this renewal?

## The Thousand And One Secrets

Not too long ago, according to one 13-year-old boy, Shor was driven from his
hall in Sovngarde. The Winter Court (see **Gods And Entities** section) wanted
to steal all his secrets, of which there were a thousand and one.

“Some of the secrets, they got.” he says. “But they didn’t learn all of ‘em.”

Shor himself disappeared that night, and all the fairies and dead heroes put
together could not find him. Some say that he was taken by the Greedy People and
killed, but “they’re wrong”, according to Freyja, an 8-year-old girl.

“Shor couldn’t be dead. He just can’t.” she says, tears in her eyes. “Then who’s
going to keep all the secrets?”

Perhaps the central figure in Nordic mythology’s uncertain state is reflective
of the perils these children face every day. You and I take living until ripe
old age as a given. That could not be further from the realities these children
face. For them, death may come as a knife in the back, or a gnawing stomach and
legs too weak to stand…or even dismemberment by Other Things or the Mara-Bitch.

Regardless of Shor’s status, the fairies and dead heroes of Sovngarde all
convened in their hall. It was decided that they were to impart some of the
Secrets to all those who would listen. The Kings and Emperors and noblemen,
however, were all swayed by the words of the Winter Court.

The reason why they were so easily fooled was explained by Aman, a 9-year-old
Redguard boy. “Maybe they’re just dumb.” Aman says.

Indeed, the rich are not viewed upon with kindness. “One day, the World-Eater’s
gonna gobble ‘em up with all their gold and houses.” says Rolff, a Nord boy
of 12. “Then they won’t be so happy all the time and won’t be able to make fun
of us.” The wealthy and powerful are always doomed to invariably grisly fates in
the end, as a result of their greed and/or foolishness.

At this point, it is impossible to understand their mythology without first
understanding the beings that people it. It must be understood that these beings
are parts of reality for them, not vaguely defined personages resting somewhere
in Oblivion or Aetherius. Every thing, every event, and every ragged breath is
overseen, sanctioned and permitted by these beings.

## Gods And Entities

### The Summer Court

The Summer Court comprises all the allies of Shor, who were left wanting without
him to guide them. In all tales involving them, they side with the downtrodden
and the underdog – likely because they are in much the same position. Good is
always portrayed as on the losing side in this mythology.

- **Fairies** – Fairies are all of “Shor’s sons and daughters”, like Men “but
  better”. Every time a moonbeam shines on Mundus, a new fairy is born.
  Children’s smiles are said to feed their power, which is why the Winter Court
  tries so hard to make so many little kids miserable. Along with Spirits,
  Fairies are the primary agents of Good in the world.

- **Spirits** – The difference between _Spirits_ and _Ghosts_ is very
  well-established. Spirits refer specifically to the ghosts aligned with Shor,
  usually the dead Nord heroes expelled from his hall but also the ghosts of
  living agents of the Winter Court. Sometimes they visit living descendants in
  dreams. Mostly they give new orders, but some of them share more stories.

- **Sygria** – The “Lady of Ragged Waters”, who always looks over abandoned and
  orphaned children. The cover of Night is actually water from her “special
  pool”, drawn over Mundus to provide protection for agents of the Summer Court.
  “Grown-ups say that night-time is bad, but that’s ‘cus the Winter Court tells
  ‘em that.” explains Freyja. Sygria is considered Shor’s sister, and every time
  she weeps for her lost brother her tears become the stars. Prayers to her are
  always made in absolute silence. Nocturnal has been unavailable for comment,
  despite repeated attempts by the College to contact her.

- **Children of Sygria** – The origins of these entities are disputed. Some say
  that they are the literal children of Sygria, violently ripping themselves
  from her womb all at once. Others say they are merely agents of Good, inducted
  into her secret circle hidden somewhere in Lake Honrich. “I saw one of ‘em
  once!” Aman insists. “She looked like a dark elf, but she had the biggest blue
  eyes I ever saw. Was sneaking into the house of a rich man. Said she was going
  to protect him from the World-Eater by taking some of his stuff.” He is
  interrupted by a flood of younger boys teasing him.

- **Shor’s Many Skins** – Shor was “like a snake who always sheds his skin”, and
  his shed skins took on lives and powers of their own. All these skins, they
  say, are the heroes and legends who lead by example. The Dragonborn is the
  most recent of the Skins, but past Skins have been Talos (whose words were
  “corrupted by the Winter Court” and “mixed with lies”) and Saint Veloth.

- **Metteya** – The origins of this word are in very archaic Nordic, and they
  are taken to mean “greatest and most majestic of prophets”. Metteya is the
  teacher who will come at the End of the World, when the World-Eater will
  return for good, and teach all righteous peoples all of the Thousand and One
  Secrets so they may defeat the Winter Court. He is the last of Shor’s Skins,
  but thanks to Shor’s mysterious disappearance it is uncertain if he will
  appear at all.

- **Other Agents** – Thieves who steal from the rich and powerful are considered
  agents of the Summer Court, whether they are aware of it or not. Orphans who
  tell these stories, of course, are also viewed as agents of the Court. There
  are also countless others who are unknown to even the Summer Court, yet are
  working against the Winter Court’s machinations.

### The Winter Court

It may surprise some that the Winter Court is not an organization _per se_.
Rather, the Winter Court is a “wanted list” of sorts, listing numerous
organizations and gods that are easily identifiable by most people.

- **The World-Eater** – Described as a “black stain with red eyes” and the
  “worst monster ever”, the World-Eater is easy for us to pin down as Alduin.
  Shor and his Skins defeated him, but eventually he will return when the
  Mara-Bitch’s reign is ended. Then only Metteya will be able to fight him, but
  (as mentioned before) even that is uncertain. His favorite snack is the
  wealthy, not because he sympathizes with the poor but because he hates the
  Mara-Bitch and all who serve her. Interestingly enough, when Akatosh is
  brought up, the response is invariably a vigorous shaking of heads, followed
  by silence.

- **The Empire** – The name should not mislead you; it does not refer to the
  Third Empire alone. Rather, it refers to all systems of government, which are
  described as being controlled by the Mara-Bitch. The Stormcloaks and the
  Dominion have also been referred to as “The Empire”, despite being bitterly
  opposed. “The Empire” is also used to describe the guards of Riften, who are
  viewed as a single malevolent entity in many bodies.

- **The Other Things** – Daedra are said to lurk in every darkened corner and
  alley. The Covenant was “a big sham” played by Alduin, not Akatosh, and Daedra
  just hide “in all the unseen places”. Mehrunes Dagon was just a “really big
  Other Thing”, and is in league with Alduin. Victims of the Other Things are
  found in the sewers, gored beyond recognition. Interestingly enough, Nocturnal
  is never described as an “Other Thing”.

- **The Mara-Bitch** – While the Other Things are allowed dominion over the
  streets, the Mara-Bitch is allowed dominion over the world. What this means is
  unknown, but it does mean that “she can listen to you from anywhere”. The
  wealthy and powerful all owe allegiance to her, and only through her authority
  are the Other Things allowed to dwell on Mundus. Uniquely, she is capable of
  destroying souls by drowning them in her own “secret rivers”. Alduin is only
  kept from “gobbling up the whole world” because even he is afraid of her. All
  things bend to her will, and there is no-one who is safe from her. When Shor
  saw that she was leading her army to Sovngarde, he cried out in despair and
  fled: for was Mara not his wife, who bore his child Mundus?

I leave you with this chilling and very vividly imagined mythology, constructed
over time by the unwanted children of the world.
