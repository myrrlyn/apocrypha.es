From Relamus Telvanni's _Chronicle of the Withering Dawn_:

It is supererogatory to annotate the history surrounding the event that removed
us from Nirn. The crisis has many names, rightfully attributed and wrongfully:
Landfall, the Withering Dawn, Man's Quietus, et all. The return of Anumidium to
the Actual shall forever be marked in the annals of time, although it must be
done with some irony; the subtraction was so complete that the date itself is
lost. Thus, the need for a formal chronicling of the moment of our resplendent
undoing is unnecessary. We will never forget the moment itself.

Instead, we turn to the realm of primary accounts. We all know what the
Withering Dawn was but few ever talk of their experiences with it. True, few
survive now who might offer such accounts but when it comes to our subject,
there are few true fundamental laws that limit us. When discussing Landfall,
mortality is a trifling matter. Worry not then, dear reader, about how this
knowledge came to be recorded. Rather, marvel that it exists at all.

## Undilarion, Altmer, of the Thalmor

“I was at ground zero. Alinor. Within seconds, most of the city did not exist
anymore. Wherever It looked, was not. It didn’t just destroy, it unmade. How do
you fight physical uncertainty? Can a sword dent armor that only exists when
you’re not looking? Is there even a way to combat an enemy that, should you
acknowledge it, rejects you so utterly that it changes the fact of you? I had
friends die in that battle. I know I did. Do I know who they were? Of course
not. They never existed. All I know for certain is that I held my mirror so
tightly that the scars on my hand might be the only real thing from that day.
The only reason we were prepared at all was because of the Oracle. She knew;
told us to have the sunbirds ready for Magnus. Yet, even knowing was not enough
on the day when knowledge was abolished.”

## Speaks-For-Them, on behalf of the Hist

“WATCHING.”

## Titinius Caro, Man

“The sky darkens ever so slightly. There is the sound of a drum, so complete
that I feel a vibration in my heart. Everyone hears it, everyone feels it. We
hear the dreaded word. “No.” Then we hear the screams. Out of all them, I find
my daughter's. So stark, so completely terrified that I don’t notice until the
time that I’ve reached her that my legs are gone. There is nothing below me but
boiling blood and eroding bone. I realize that I am screaming. I reach for my
daughter and watch as her face melts. I feel myself becoming unbound. I stop
screaming. My mouth is gone. The fabric of “Man” is unraveling. It hurts. The
rejection hurts. My arm turns to mist before it can reach her. I writhe on the
ground as each piece of me, each mortal modicum disappears one by one. It takes
less than a minute. There are 31,536,000 seconds in a year. This is the nine
hundredth year.”

## Jyggalag, Daedra, Prince of the Now Defunct Sphere of Order

“I will have led my forces to the very heart of the Colored Rooms, knowing the
Lady of Infinite Energies to be one of the only true threats against my
Endmarch. The dazzling lights of her realm will have been refracted by crystals
innumerable. Atop a rainbow tower corkscrewed by grey, she will have deflected
my sword by summoning Dawnbreaker. I will have gathered too much strength for
the rejected Star Orphan by then, however, and blade will explode in brilliance.
But the sudden draw of incalculable Chaos will have stayed my hand from further
action. My forces will have fallen back and they will have fought the Brass
Beast for centuries.”

## Divayth Fyr, Dunmer, Corprusorcerer

“If you’re asking where I was when the Numidium “returned”, you’re asking the
wrong question. Because the truth is that _it never left_. You were just too
busy ignoring it. How could you not? To look at something so terrible is to
invite cessation. To hear its alarum is to risk waking up from your dream. You
did not ignore it out of malice; you ignored it out of survival. But if I must
answer such a faulty question, you will get a question in turn: where _wasn’t_
I? I’ve always been listening to the Crying Tower from its first wail until it’s
last death rattle. During Landfall? I was at zeropoint. Staring right into its
eyes. Someone had to.”

\[It is at this point the author must point out to the eminent sorcerer that
Anumidium still walks.\]

“Ah. I guess now we know where _you_ were when the Numidium died.”
