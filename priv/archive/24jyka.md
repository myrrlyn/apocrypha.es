When asked to name itself, it dared to take the wise woman’s staff and scribe
within the fallen soot: ∅. Following, it seized the Ashkan’s blade and carved
marrowtrue revealing a stoned heart. Thus, it showed itself to be thrice
skinned. The hue of life, the rot of death, and the ash of Atherius coated its
body. Speaking:

> *“I am walker of the Molag’d dust, dream of the dead dreaming dreamer, Vemyn*
> *friend, and solar ash mender. My house numbers six and none. My age: 4444.*
> *My second age: 55555. Attend, Erabenimsun! Attend the words of the Sharmat’s*
> *slave! Red Sunder’d and tune set, a death knell rang throughout the Mount*
> *and slithered out the dreamsleeve, circling around to bounce off itself,*
> *ending at the start. For aurals made Keen can do little else.*
>
> *The note contraposed the Sharmat’s inverse endeavor. Nirn trembled. Vvarden*
> *fell. Red’s spine snapped. Triangular idols melted. A Tusk septum tore and*
> *we, Doht Seht, awoke far from Molag’d earth. Golden eyed thal stamped out*
> *the wonder-mirrors of belief forevermore, far worse than the Sharmat’s*
> *second bounding brass destruction drive ever could. With only shards left,*
> *what you know as the spun web could not self sustain and broke, clicking all*
> *the while. First brass remained forged and awoke on Landfall. The World Egg*
> *cracked and Aurbis subtracted to bring us here again. For aurals made Keen*
> *can do little else.”*

At this, ∅ reached into its chest and ripped the stoney heart out, breaking into
ash.
