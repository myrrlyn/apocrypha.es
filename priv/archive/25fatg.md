## The Diversity of Vampirism

As we well know, vampirism spreads via a disease. There are several well
documented strains of this disease, the two most notable of our time being
Porphyric Hemophilia and Sanguinare Vampiris. I have also, in my travels, heard
of Noxiphilic Sanguivora which apparently spread across most of Tamriel in the
second era, but has since been either eradicated or at least pushed back into
isolated pockets in one or more provinces.

The vampires themselves seem to group themselves by what they call bloodlines.
Each bloodline appears to have different strengths and perhaps even weaknesses.
These groups seem to be highly territorial and, as my research suggests, can
even go to war with one another. This could be used against them as tensions
between two bloodlines could be used to set them upon each other. Thus we could
possibly get the vampires to eradicate each other. This would only be an option
for Dawn Guard posted on the borders of these territories however, as such I
believe a mission to map out these territories would be beneficial.

Due to the various abilities shown by different bloodlines I believe that each
bloodline is the result of a different strain of the vampiric disease. For
instance, Skyrim is inhabited by vampires of the Volkihar bloodline, all of
which are corrupted by and spread Sanguinare Vampiris. The territorial nature of
these bloodline then ensures that Sanguinare Vampiris is the only strain of the
disease within Skyrim.

## On their Origins

The question then becomes how did these diseases start? A book found in my
travels tells of the first vampire.
[Opusculus Lamae Bal ta Mezzamortie](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/opusculus-lamae-bal-ta-mezzamortie)
tells of Molag Bals displeasure with Arkays perfect circle of life and death and
in an attempt to disrupt it created the first vampire, Lamae Beolfag, by
viciously raping and brutalising her before finally shedding a drop of his own
blood upon her brow. And so the very first vampire was born. It is unknown which
bloodline this started.

It must be that each bloodline of vampires starts in a similar way, that is,
through Molag Bal and his interaction with a mortal. Some of these victims may
even be willing as daedric cults are quite common in some regions. I imagine to
a cultist of Molag Bal, becoming a vampire by the hand of Bal himself must be a
mighty honour. It is fitting that the blessing of so vile a daedric prince only
spreads his corruption and domination further. As such, the Vigilants of Stendar
were right in their persecution of daedric worship and the Dawn Guard should
consider doing the same.

## The Vampires of Skyrim

The Volkihar are the only bloodline of vampires present in Skyrim. This is due
mostly to their power, as I imagine they brutally quash any invasions from rival
bloodlines into their territory. This bloodline is referenced in [Immortal
Blood][0], a book written by a gloating Cyrodiilic vampire, copies of which have
unfortunately become widespread throughout Tamriel. In this they are called
cruel, even by vampire standards, which is a fairly accurate assessment.

## Origin of the Volkihar

The Volkihar carry a variation of the vampiric disease known as Sanguinare
Vampiris and have managed to ensure that this is the only strain of the disease
present within Skyrim, thus claiming the entire province as their feeding
territory. After combing through records in the College of Winterhold and the
Blue Palace in Solitude it appears that in times past a family by the name of
Volkihar held lands in Skyrim. They were also recorded to be known daedric
worshippers.

Thus I do not think it too much of a stretch to assume that this family
subjected themselves to the whim of Molag Bal willingly and became the first
Volkihar vampires. I can only assume that if this family still exists they must
be considered royalty or hold the court over their lesser kin. Perhaps they even
view the lower generations of the bloodline with distain, allowing only the
eldest of their kind into their lair.

## Behaviour and Powers

The standard Volkihar vampire, that is not of the inner sanctum of the Volkihar
family, seem to enjoy making their lairs beneath the ice of Skyrims lakes,
emerging only to feed. As with the land of Skyrim itself, these vampires seem to
use the cold as a weapon, their breath can freeze the blood in a mans veins and
they are masters of elemental spells involving ice or cold magics.

They also seem to enjoy the ability to turn themselves invisible, yet only use
this power to escape when loosing a battle, preferring a direct confrontation
than to use their abilities to sneak up on their prey. They have also been
reported to be able to grasp onto their prey through the ice in which they make
their lairs.

The inner sanctum of the Volkihar vampires, seem to be different again entirely.
They are able to retain the almost human appearance of their lesser kin, but
also seem to have the ability to turn into a form more fitting of their horrific
nature. The only account of this I can find comes from the recent uprise in
vampire activity in Skyrim. A small mill in The Pale was devastated by a vampire
attack, the only survivor a small boy of twelve. I have recorded his words
below:

“It came in the night. The big one, and the two hooded people with it. It wasn’t
man or mer whatever it was. It floated just above the ground and drained the
life out of the guards with only looking at 'em. It’s skin was all grey and
shrivelled, that’s all I saw before I ran and hid in me mothers closet. I
swear.”

I can only assume that this is the form of a pure blooded Volkihar vampire,
perhaps one of the family members to be initially turned by Molag Bal himself.
These abilities must degrade over the generations of vampires so that only the
eldest or chosen of the Volkihar have this ability.

## Weaknesses

As with all vampires, the Volkihar are weakened by the sun, but no where near as
much as other bloodlines are reported to be. Reading histories of vampires from
Cyrodiil, it can be assumed that the sun kills the vampires there, but I have
witnessed first hand Volkihar standing in the sun. His magicka reserves seemed
depleted by the suns rays and the wounds I inflicted upon him did not heal as
they would have under the cover of darkness, but it was assuredly I that killed
him, not exposure to the sun.

This is most likely the reason that the Volkihar territory is so well guarded,
the ability to raid enemy nests during the day, or even to move while the sun is
up at all would give them a huge advantage over rival bloodlines. All in all,
the Volkihar are possibly the most powerful and most dangerous of the
bloodlines. Extreme care is advised when hunting them.
