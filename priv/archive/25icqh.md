## The Vampires of Morrowind

While not nearly as many bloodlines are present in Morrowind today, a book I
sourced from a friendly dunmer while in Solstheim, [Vampires of Vardenfell][0],
tells of three bloodlines that used to rule over Morrowind. They organised
themselves into three “clans” the Aundae, the Quarra and Berne, which made their
nests on Vardenfell, however each of these clans had outcasts leading to rogue
vampires of the three bloodlines also prowling the lands. As this book was
originally from the early third era, it can be safely assumed that it is well
outdated by now as the Oblivion Crisis and Red Year have changed the face of
Morrowind.

## The Origins of Morrowinds Vampires

As with all vampires, they came from Molag Bal and carry a variation of the
vampiric disease. However, the locals of Morrowind do not seem to be able to
differentiate between the three strains of the disease and thus all are referred
to as Porphyric Hemophilia. It is very difficult to track the origins of each of
the bloodlines as almost all of them are currently near extinction, difficult to
track or have left Morrowind entirely. However, all research on vampires within
Morrowind points towards Molag Bal desecrating the corpse of a fallen foe.

No two sources can agree on what form the fallen foe took however, some say a
daedra, some a foul beast and one even went so far as to suggest a saint of the
temple of the Tribunal. I would go so far as to say that perhaps all of these
sources are true, and each fallen foe is the beginning of one of the three
bloodlines of Morrowind. This would explain the similarities between the three
if all were created from the desecration of a corpse rather than a living being.
As to which is which I could not say for sure, the true origins of the Aundae,
Quarra and Berne bloodlines may well be lost to history all together.

## The Aundae

Perhaps one of the strangest of the Morrowind clans, they comprise entirely of
altmer, though I do not believe this to be a limitation of the disease strain,
but rather some form of racial elitism stemming from the elders of the clan. As
altmer, these vampires are already naturally inclined towards magic, but the
Aundae bloodline appears to have exaggerated this ability in each of them.

The current state of the Aundae is completely unknown. Records and tales from
the late third era indicate that infighting between the clans caused heavy
casualties for the Aundae, but they came out the better for it and yet they are
no longer present in either mainland Morrowind or Vardenfell. I theorise that
the survivors of the Red Year and Oblivion Crisis may have fled back to their
ancestral homeland of Alinor. Confirming this may be difficult however as travel
to Alinor would be highly limited in the current political climate.

## The Quarra

The Quarra are the most physically powerful of the bloodlines in Morrowind and
held the largest territory. They are the most vicious and aggressive of any
vampire I have met, forgoing any stealth or secrecy and can raid entire towns in
the night, killing and capturing many. While these raids are uncommon they are
devastating and are set into the memory of the townsfolk for generations. This
became useful as the folk lore of these small towns, while they must be taken
with a grain of salt, are valuable resources when collating descriptions of
Quarra attacks.

While they seem to have diminished in numbers by the early 4th era, they are
still quite active on the mainland of Morrowind, though their courage seems as
diminished as their numbers as there have been no large scale assaults from the
Quarra since the Red Year, only small attacks on inns and farms scattered about
their old territories. In a one on one combat with a Quarra, they are deadly,
perhaps the most deadly, but as a bloodline, they seem to be greatly weakened.

## The Berne

The Berne clan are easily the most terrifying of all of Morrowinds vampires.
Masters of stealth and ambush they are deadly hunters fuelled by sadism and
hunger. Their bloodline seems to grant unnatural agility and prowess in unarmed
combat. Another book scavenged from Morrowinds past gives the best description
of their hunting habits. [Trap][1] is an account of a victim of the Berne clan
who was tricked and hunted. The use of trickery, shadows and terror give the
impression that the Berna enjoy the hunt as much, if not more so, than the kill.

During my travels among small villages on both Vardenfell and mainland Morrowind
tales of strange disappearances and mysterious cloaked figures with glowing eyes
were disturbingly common. Thus it must be assumed that the Berne clan, or at
least bloodline is strong within Morrowind and very active. I would suggest
setting up an outpost in Morrowind as soon as possible to deal with this threat,
the populace lives in fear of the night in some regions because of these fiends.

## Weaknesses

All three bloodlines in Morrowind share the same weaknesses. They are all
severely damaged by exposure to sunlight as it is deadly to them. As such they
are never seen by day, hiding in dwemer ruins, caves and other such dank lairs.
In addition to this they are very vulnerable to fire, often being unable to
extinguish the flames if they are set alight. However, most notable is that they
are easily distinguishable by their glowing yellow eyes. This allows for the
populace to identify them, stopping any from infiltrating society as the
Volkihar are wont to do.
