Day 4, Cycle B

As soon as we entered the twilight cycle, started yelling from the observation
deck. We had just changed shifts, so I got to him first. The moons had shrunk to
the sizes we expected them to be. was hysterical for a little bit, but we calmed
him down in a few minutes.

Over lunch we discussed the change. He-Who-Reads thinks that until then, we were
within the influence of the moons. agrees with him, and cites the Lunar Lattice
in his argument. I told the two to confer with each other and to write an
official report.

Llevan disagrees with their ideas. He thinks that the twilight cycle was the key
here, that Azura is now guiding us into the unknown. He-Who-Reads counter argues
that if that was the case, why didn’t this happen last twilight cycle? I pointed
out that no Daedric Prince should be able to influence the ship, and Llevan
admitted that this was true. Still, the powers of the Daedra are many and
varied.

Speaking of lunch, I’m getting tired of potatoes.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
