Day 4, Cycle C

Nirn and the moons continue to grow smaller.

We met what we believe is a daedra or aedra. Unfortunately, we cannot confirm
this. It did not match any description of any known daedra (save a form of the
Prince of Infinite Energies, though the Dragon Fires should be keeping her out),
and we can’t reach out to it without comprising our safety. Not that we had the
chance.

It appeared as a ball of bright light. Wisps of orange and blue flames could
occasionally be seen protruding from its edges. It didn’t interact with us in
the slightest. It passed us by at incredible speeds, and we only managed to
observe it by reviewing slices of our memories. The training I received before
take off has proven to be immeasurably valuable.

posited that it might be a lesser Aedra, going through its own orbit around
Nirn. This seems plausible, though what this would mean is incredible. We’ll
have to see if we encounter other such balls of light.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
