  For those of you seeing any of these for the first time, I highly recommend
  you read [On Trolls: The Pantheon of the Wagkuni](./261v2i) and [A Troll
  Creation Myth](./262a1w). The following will be easier to follow if you do
  that. Other than that, please enjoy the final chapter in my 3-part series on
  trolls for the writing initiative “High Rock is Cool”.

  This work is dedicated to /u/Avian81, for always being helpful, and because
  it’s also his birthday. Happy Birthday man!

  Big thank you goes out to /u/Avian81, who did the fantastic artwork of the
  three-eye troll. Be sure to check out his work on his reddit,

_On the 25th day, in the 3rd month of the civil year, to be read aloud for seven
days, followed by a day of silence. A dedication to Aluthareis who saved our
people from the madness of the Gathrahan._

The history of [our people][0], as you all know, began with the sundering of
holy Maganwag from Halja. The trial of the gods above eventually yielded their
fate, to be [resung][1] at the beginning of each capo. And we, [the children of
wolves][2], are their progeny.

![][2]{:style="background: grey;"}

We came first to this Drunjusland, which the folly of men has decreed as
Dunlain, singing an ancient song from our frozen homeland. The land was
unclaimed and ripe for our choosing, so our tribes laid claim to it. Through
toil and strife, and mastering of anan, which misguided man and mer recall as
“fey” (they forget so quickly who [Ahrtabazus][3] learned from!), we conquered
the whole of this land, and created a paradise that the world had not seen since
the fall of our homeland. Tunnels we burrowed into the earth, to hide us from
the blinding sun for rest, and great towers we built upon mountains, to forever
confirm our mastery.

In time, a blight had risen from the land, and our leader in those days, Kunnan,
set forth with our Driuganwag, to deal with the plague that Fugle had brought to
test us. We were in horror at what we saw. A chorus of [great insects][4] with
[\[spiral proboscis\]][5] and [\[cicada-shaped bodies\]][6]. They were blue with
the color of the frozen world, Magtriu. Fumes they released that could make a
Wag see things that were not; a blessing from a foul and foreign god who
corrupts our most precious dreams. When we had finally crossed through our
shattered Drunjusland to meet them, it was already forever altered. The
creatures surrounded Kunnan and his Driuganwag, his most prized soldiers, and
used their unworldly vapors to make us dream forever. It was only by the mercy
of Warqina, and the blessing of Aluthareis that our \[third-eyes\] could remain
open. Misfortunate for our enemies, to not know that only hoary Bokhuna can
remove our greatest gift.

Kunnan, having sight beyond the greatest of Wagkuni, opened all ten of his eyes
until he could see what the compelled creatures, who did not carry the grace of
freedom, truly lacked. When the mist had cleared, their third eyes had opened,
and we then sang them into the Great Song, naming them Ndbahs, our chosen
friends.

But there was no rejoicing, for the land had become forever desolated, with
which we…

\[…\] \[Text is indecipherable\]

…the fifth month of our civil calendar, we began our war with the alves. Our
greatest of seers had forseen their coming, and we had prepared our greatest.
Our [\[Thriceborn Warriors\]][7] who had sacrificed themselves by becoming
sealed in the empty shell of an Ndbahs, allowing their larva to take over their
minds. More savage than even Wag, and with an [armored carapace] that could be
reborn as our flesh is reborn, we believed we were ready.

But when the time came, the might of of the Dir’anan proved to be too much for
even our greatest. With mathemagics and golems inscribed with the names of eight
earthbones, they could crush even our mightiest. With sorcery and
\[magi-logistics\], they could cut supply lines with a stroke of a pen. In time,
even our great \[under-surface\] halls \[…\]

\[…came for our seers first\] and then left us leaderless. \[…even\]
\[Queen…murdered\]

\[…\]

With the mother of Ndbahs, their Queen dead, the silence finally began. For the
first time in the history of our people, the gates of the Gathrahan were thrown
open. Mothers held their babes to their chest, letting their heartbeat keep them
secure. Many of us sat chanting softly in the dark catacombs, waiting for the
\[thrice-damned\] alves to come and finish us off. We lost thousands to the
madness, and more to the cruel, calculated, genocide of the Dir’anan. This
continued for seven days, until it seemed to all surviving that the rest of our
people were gone, or had gone mad. \[…own….slaughtered…numbered…\].

On the eighth day, hours after our cruel foe left us, the music began again.
What was left of us had been saved by the immaculate song. What remained of our
\[Thriceborn\] were used to put to rest as many of our deranged brethren as we
could. And this was the miracle we were blessed with: on reaching the sanctum of
the Ndbahs Queen, we realized that her song had returned. There were no signs of
life, yet she was filled with the Great Song she had been part of for centuries.
Every inch of her shell was blessed in this magic, and we gave thanks to
Aluthareis, who had saved our people.

And for this reason, we spend this week remembering the lost, who are scattered
over the whole of the Starry Heart, and remember the mercy \[…\]
