Day 15, Cycle C

It is my wish that the world remembers me as a steadfast, rational captain,
someone that would not dissolve into tears upon facing near certain death and
the destruction of his very soul. However, I cannot in good faith remove the
page I wrote before. I will leave it up to the Council to publish it or not.

The Daedric boat that we encountered before is alive. A small plane unto itself,
it appeared as Cycle B started and ate us. The Sigil Stones are inoperative, and
no calling or summoning seems to work. This plane is closed off. attempted to
get us out, but even he can’t open a portal.

I tried having the banishrip auras extended out, but with the Sigil Stones down
they did not work. I thought they wouldn’t, but tried just in case.

The plane looks infinite, though I know it is not. Murky, foggy space. The wards
are keeping us alive, but Llevan tells us that they are under constant stress. I
don’t know how long we’ll last, but, between the 4 of us, I’m sure we’ll think
of something.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
