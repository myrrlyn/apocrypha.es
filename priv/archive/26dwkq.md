Day 15, Cycle C

The daedric plane we’re in has been increasing the intensity of its assault. A
net of lightning currently surrounds the ship, and is applying constant
pressure. Occasionally a spear, or tendril, will come out of the fog and smack
against the wards.

So far, the wards have held, but our soul gems are losing power quickly. Only a
few more cycles until the wards fall. I’d like to wager that this record will
never be found, but stranger things have happened.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
