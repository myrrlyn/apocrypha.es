Recently, thanks to C0DA and ESO, we’ve learned a lot about how memory worked in
the Elder Scrolls. I’m trying to compile most of data and deductions on the
subject of Memory ; and, therefore, on Souls, and finally, on Magic. Discussions
about this already occured, but it has always been on a point or another, and
the full view has never been given.

Memory is extremly present in The Elder Scrolls since Daggerfall, where Makela
Leki recordes her [last thoughts][0] in a Memory Stone. These memory stones are
also found in Vivec/Cyrus [Sword Meeting][1] : the stones teach Cyrus how to
fight better.

We understand this a bit thanks to [The Republic of Hahd][2] , and we guess
something important is behind throught the [Loveletter][3] . Our curiosity is
then drawn to [Mnemoli][4] – [the Mnemoli][5] (plural) according to [Mankar][6]
. But we are not given any answer before one of MK’s AMA :

> Who or what is the Drowned Lamp?
>
> Drowned Lamp: Knowledge that is lost.

SITHISIT, 28, the drowned lamp, lost knowledge? Seeing this next to the Captive
Sage (29) – whose knowledge is nearly lost, because he is in sensory
deprivation, is probably important.

And :

> Mnemoli- does it have to do with knowledge or memory of failed Amaranth?
>
> @Mojo, that’s a wide net you got there. Narrow it.
>
> @Mojo: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic

So… learning technic?

Finally, [C0DA][7] was released, and we had some answers - or questions,
depending on how you look at it. Mnemoly seems to be more or less the memory of
Nirn, or of the person in the Mundus, and memory is vanishing.

We can add the [art][8] where Sotha Sil has a child, added compared to the
Morrowind version, and MK giving the confirmation that the child is Mnemoli,
but…

I think we might have to wait for Dies Irae for more things on this side.

At the same time, ESO surprised everyone by how most of it was well done.
[This][9] raised a lot of attention.

Memory goes into the Water – and remember the “waters of Oblivion”.

The lost knowledge is the drowned Lamp.

The selfishness of the sea is Seht’s domain.

Mnemolichite is extracted by Hahds, living under water.

Then, we add soul. Soul and Memory are different ; some ghosts don’t have the
same soul as when they where alive, but have kept their memory. On the other
hand, Necromancers, with mysticism, manage sometimes to “steal” souls, but don’t
have access to memory.

The link between souls and magicka is very strong : soul gems and enchanted
objects are an obvious example. In fact, the “gradient” mentionned by [Baladas
Demnevanni][10] and in the Loveletter are probably linked to the size of “souls”
– or rather “magickal composition”.

All mortal races, have the same size of souls ; they are all at the Mortal
Death.

“Gods” like Vivec or Almalexia, have bigger souls.

Dwemer animunculi have smaller souls.

If a difference can be made between mortals and lesser daedra, it is first that
the soul and memory of the daedra are kept after death, and reborn from the
**waters** of Oblivion. Mortals can either have their soul (and sometimes
memory) sent to an Ada (Aedra or Daedra) ; or their soul is sent to the
Dreamsleeve and “[soon recycled][3]” while their memory is lost to the Drowned
Lamp ([See Cyrus][1]).

So, why are all Ada nearly fighting for souls ? Souls are probably the [lunar
currency][11] mentionned in the Sermons and explained in the Loveletter.

We can guess that souls, creatia (“[raw mythic energy][1]”), and magicka, are
more or less the same thing. When Magnus begins to bleed creatia (in fact
“[kaleidocules][12]” on the Mundus, it gives magicka coming from somewhere else
than souls to use for the Mortals.

In the [Nu-Mantia Intercept][13], it is explained that Stones cultivate “creatia
that washed into the Void from Aetherius”. Because Magnus “blood” passes by
Oblivion before reaching Mundus: “[Magnus is the sun, the largest hole in
Oblivion, and the gateway to magic.][14]”

We can even notice that Magicka can use other means that the creatia coming from
the Sun.

Blood Magic probably takes its energy from the blood, and therefore from the
soul of the person. We can notice that it is developped by Vampires, linked to
Molag Bal who likes creating “Soulless ones”.

[Shadow Magic][15] is also interesting :

> shadow was not simply an absence of light, but a reflection of possible worlds
> created by forces in conflict. Shadows can be produced by mundane forces such
> as light hitting a rock, or by more powerful forces such as nations at war.
> Shadow Magic involves the manipulation of shadows to affect the forces
> creating it.

Changing the consequence can, with Shadow Magic, affect the cause – it seems to
be really close to what happens in Dragon Breaks. The “forces in conflit” are
probably the source of energy needed for magic.

There’s in fact a lot of different magic, like [Mnemolic Sorcery][4], but the
point is to notice that magicka is really present everywhere ; and in fact, all
could be seen as a mix of magicka and memory.

The stars, are creatia coming from Aetherius ; and what all Ada are looking for
is this creatia, this “raw mythic energy”.
