Day 18, Cycle B

and Llevan are resting. They are drained of energy, and will need a while to
recuperate. He-Who-Reads and I will have to deal with the standard operations in
the mean time. I thought about breaking out some wine, but we need our wits
about us.

Even if it was only few days in the daedric plane, it felt like weeks. I ran
over our stores, but we’ll be fine until the next provisioning day. should be
feeling good by then. Unless the Emperor wants to come here himself and shout us
along, I’m not sure how we will continue the mission. Mission Akatouch might be
at it’s end.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
