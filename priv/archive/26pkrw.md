## The Greatest of Daedra, The Gates of Night, and The Daedric Interest in Mundus

Oblivion, in some ways, is not so different from Mundex Arena. The innumerable
Daedric Princes squabble for power just as much, if not more, than your mortal
politicians do. They wage wars that last for an eternity and trade favors to
further their concept’s influence over the Aurbis, gaining power in the process.
However, not all Daedra are created equal. The Brush of the Gray Maybe produces
many spirits, but the greatest in all of Oblivion are The Fifteen Add One.

BAL VAERNIMA SANGUINE NAMIRA HIRCINE CLAVICUS VILE MERIDIA PEYRITE

They are the True Royalty of Oblivion. Though there are many other Daedra who
can easily be called a Prince in terms of power, and perhaps can even stand up
to one of these on their own, the Fifteen together are nearly unstoppable. My
list is as I last knew of them. They were not always Fifteen.Their numbers have
changed several times, as members have been kicked out, added back and new
members have been added in. Regardless of this, they have always been the most
powerful alliance in Oblivion.

## The Founding of Oblivion

I wasn’t present to witness the beginning, but I have heard accounts from the
Ge. Their story began when Ald-Lorkhan started spreading the idea of a
subcreation of their own so they could better understand themselves. The Spirits
that would later be called the Aedra agreed with Lorkhan and decided to follow
his plan. The Spirits later called Daedra Princes by your scholars, on the other
hand, did not agree with Lorkhan. They believed creating something separate from
yourself was a dangerous idea. Most Spirits agreed with them and moved on.

The Spirit that came to be known as Nocturnal didn’t stop there. She was a very
cunning Spirit, embodying mystery and suspicion. It was due to her nature that
she was able to detect that there might be something more to Lorkhan’s plan, but
she saw merit in the idea of creating something for yourself and yourself alone.

She arranged a secret meeting with Hermaeus Mora while Magnus and Lorkhan were
still working on Mundus. He was the first spirit that could truly be called a
Daedric Prince, as he was born of Magnus’ thrown away ideas, and Nocturnal
wanted to know how he created his realm of Apocrypha. He told her his secret in
exchange for a favor. After that, she disappeared from the notice of most other
Spirits.

What follows next is difficult to explain in mortal terms. The closest analogy I
can give is that Nocturnal gathered a vast amount of Creatia from Anu and “cut”
Sithis. She then mixed the blood of Sithis with the blood of Anu, creating the
Gray Maybe on a smaller scale. As if this was not momentous enough, she then did
what seemed impossible: She bound this miniature Aurbis to her own Will. It
became a part of her, and she became a part of it. She created the first true
Realm of Oblivion.

This event sent shockwaves throughout most of this Branch of the World River. It
is in the nature of all Spirits to self-reflect, and Nocturnal had succeeded
where all others failed. Countless spirits who didn’t agree with Lorkhan’s plan
went to her and asked how she had done it, and she shared freely. Legions of
Spirits began to create their own physical forms and realms with none of the
cost associated with Lorkhan’s plan.

What Nocturnal didn’t tell them was the effect creating her Realm had on her.
All spirits desire self-reflection so they can better understand themselves, but
few have ever achieved this. The Princes create their Realms as mirrors. By
looking into their Realm, they can better understand who they are. Likewise, the
Lesser Daedra gravitate to Princes that can help themselves better understand
who they are. The process of this changes you, however. You are no longer as you
imagined yourself to be. The Reflection reveals who you are. Creating a Realm of
Oblivion sacrifices potential for a better grasp on your concept.

Nocturnal saw her face in the Evergloam. She saw that she wasn’t merely Mystery
or Suspicion, she was so much more. She was closer to the Void than any other
Spirit. She was the very essence of Oblivion. The more Realms of Oblivion were
created, the more powerful she became. By the time the Mundus was complete, she
was nearly the most powerful being in the Aurbis.

## The Creation of the Void Mirror Pact

But power alone wasn’t enough for her. Oblivion was overflowing with Spirits
eager to take their place among the Daedra, and she realized that sooner or
later they might become a threat. She gathered the most powerful Daedric Princes
she could find and offered an arrangement. If any other Spirit should become a
threat too big for all of them, they would work together and destroy it. The
Greatest of the Daedra agreed to this plan, and thus the Void Mirror Pact was
born.

The Pact hasn’t stopped all of the enmity between them. Mehrunes The Razor has
had many an epic clash against Molag Bal on the shores of Coldharbour, and
Sheogorath routinely interferes in the machinations of Hermaeus Mora. For all
that it fails to keep peace between them, it has served them well though. Not
many Daedra have slipped past their reach, and those that have rarely are able
to exert much influence on the Mundus.

The most famous use of the Pact was to stop one of its very own members. The
Crystal Knight had proven to be a menace to all by conquering vast swaths of
Oblivion and building a great Fortress. Realizing that the time she feared had
finally come, Nocturnal invoked the Pact and summoned the power of all her
allies. They channeled this power into a curse, which halted the Knights of
Order in their tracks. Jyggalag was turned into Sheogorath and the crisis was
solved.

## The Gates of Night

Magnus and the Magna-Ge’s escape from the mortal plane proved to be a problem
for the Daedra. Prior to their desperate crash through Oblivion, the regulation
of Creatia flowing from Aetherius was relatively easy. The Stars changed that by
creating gaping wounds in Oblivion. Magicka poured through the gaps at a
staggering rate, which had a very negative effect on the various Realms.
Maintaining a Realm of Oblivion is a balancing act. Too many Daedrons or too
much Creatia and it will destroy itself; the holes torn by Magnus and the
Magna-Ge upset this balance.

Nocturnal acted quickly. In truth, she realized that only the Sun was a real
threat. The magicka being leaked from the smaller stars wasn’t enough to cause
any serious problems. The Sun, however, was hemorrhaging magick at such a high
rate that it could destroy several Realms of Oblivion if not dealt with.

Using her powers over darkness, she constructed vast Gates around the Sun. These
Gates are made of pure, concentrated shadow, so it can withstand the power of
the Sun and blot it out for a time. It can’t hold back the Sun’s power forever,
so Nocturnal periodically opens it back up and repairs it for the next time.
This is seen on Mundus as the Day/Night Cycle, where Day is the Sun providing a
view of Aetherius and Night is Nocturnal shrouding the sun so only Oblivion is
viewable.

I have also seen Nocturnal use the Gates as a sort of border between the Aether
and Oblivion. The Sun is the easiest gate between the two places, so Nocturnal
further increased her power over Oblivion by building the Gates there. She can
stop most Spirits from coming and going if she likes, but there are exceptions.
I simply go through another constellation. It’s too much of a bother to
constantly deal with Nocturnal and her cronies every time you want to leave
Oblivion.

## The Daedric Interest in Mundus

I don’t know for sure why so many Daedric Princes are interested in Mundus and
mortals. They might just enjoy having a personal playground kept away from the
rest of the Daedra, but I don’t think that is all there is to it.

The Mundus, like Oblivion, is a reflection. The biggest difference is that the
Mundus is a reflection of the Aurbis as a whole rather than the reflection of a
single Spirit. This creates a huge number of opportunities. As I said earlier,
all Spirits are given to self-reflection, and the Mundus is another way of doing
that. I think the Greatest of Daedra saw the potential of the Mundus to spread
their concepts and in turn make them more powerful, and by making them more
powerful, more capable of understanding themselves.

A Realm of Oblivion can reflect one’s self, true. But it cannot explain how your
concept interacts with other concepts easily. The Evergloam reveals to Nocturnal
who she is, but not who she is in relation to Sex and Death. Moonshadow tells
Azura who she is, but not who she is in relation to Plots. There is no easy way
for these concepts to interact in Oblivion, because they are all separated from
one another.

The Mundus is a different story altogether. Mundex Arena can house all of their
concepts at once, and show them who they are in relation to one another. The
Three Good Daedra didn’t take the Chimer from Summerset without reason. Azura,
Boethiah, and Mephala wanted to see how their spheres interacted. Their
exclusive ownership of the Mundus also gives them the ability to interact with
the spheres of the Aedra, which are concepts long lost to every spirit not a
part of the mortal plane.

Perhaps mortals ask themselves, “Why does Mehrunes Dagon destroy?”, or “Why does
Mephala murder?”. They do it for the same reason I explore every corner of the
World River- They want to find themselves.

It is a difficult thing for a mortal to understand. You are born unmantled, with
nothing to define yourself with other than your own existence. As you grow, you
change. You choose new concepts to make a part of yourself-shopkeeper, husband,
thief, warrior, father, mage, etc. By the end of your life you have defined
yourself.

We Spirits can never change. From the moment our concept is born, we will embody
that concept forever. We cannot change who we are. We cannot betray our nature.
The only path for us is inward, to discover more of who we are and what we
represent.

Perhaps that was what Lorkhan saw in his project. His limits were in truth
freedom. Maybe the idea of beings who can choose who they really are is as
intoxicating a prospect for the Greatest of Daedric Princes as it was for
Lorkhan when he began the Mundus Whirlpool. I don’t know for sure.

What I do know is that the Greatest of Daedra are still circling the Mundus.
Their Pact has lasted for untimes innumerable, and I do not see it faltering any
untime soon. The Gates of Night are still as strong as ever, and the Daedra are
always growing in power. The games have only just begun.
