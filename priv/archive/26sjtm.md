Day 20, Cycle A

What is a shooting star? Was the orange and blue ball of light a shooting star?
Today, I was on the observation deck and noticed a streak of blue traveling
between the stars. He-Who-Reads confirms my equations; it was traveling faster
than anything we’ve ever seen, save light from Aetherius. The ball of light we
saw earlier disappeared from sight when it went behind the moons, but this blue
streak has no where to hide and is traveling across the stars, instead of into
them, from our perspective.

By mapping it’s location against the constellations, we were able to obtain it’s
speed. A full report is being written by He-Who-Reads. I’m writing a full
account of our manipulation of the shout, and including an (I hope) impassioned
plea that will get us moving forward again.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
