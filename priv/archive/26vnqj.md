Day 20, Cycle A

The blue streak is still there, against the stars. We’re tracking it.

opened the portal, and the first thing to go through was my report and a piece
of paper that I wrote as big as possible, "READ NOW." At the end of the
provisioning, we ~~recie~~ received a note back that said that said they would
contact us in three days, to be ready then for another portal.

In the meantime, He-Who-Reads finally got his Histcarp. He set it in his room, a
blue pearl against the quasi-darkness. Poetry aside we’ll have to cycle water
for it. He-Who-Reads has decorated the round tank with some feathers, though why
I don’t know why. It looks nice, though, so maybe that’s all the reason he
needs.

I wonder what they’ll do to get us going forward.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
