Day 24, Cycle A

They started the summons rather early, for us anyways. We’ve been given a
circular frame, that is quite literally humming with power. An empty circle
within a circle, and threaded lines connecting them in a criss-cross pattern.
The threads are what hum. It is my understanding that this object contains the
shout of the Emperor.

We’ve been told to put on our void suits and to attach it to the rear of the
ship, and to get back inside before giving it a good shake. We have also been
told not to trip while holding it.

Can you imagine? What would happen if we did? I told Llevan to prepare suits for
and I. We’ll go out and attach this thing as best as we’re able to.

The blue streak is still visible. If it is some sort of Aedra, I hope that it is
sending us blessings.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
