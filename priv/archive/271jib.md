Day 24, Cycle B

It’s a curious thing, to be outside of … what I suppose I’ll call logic. The
natural order. Order in general, unless it is the force of mind and personality
that creates order. I turned to thinking about He-Who-Reads and his fish … says
I was half fish, half lizard for a moment. How I held onto the shout holder, I
do not know.

Despite the sight of tendrils forming off shoulders, or color fading in and out
of my own vision, or all of the other things we saw, we managed to attach the
holder to the backside of the ship.

After getting inside and making sure we had our proper shapes (I think my ears
are a bit bigger? Is forehead … longer?) I had Llevan give the wards a quick
flux. That got us moving very quickly. I’m surprised, and humbled, by the
Emperor’s power.

Onward to Akatosh.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
