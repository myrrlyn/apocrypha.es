Day 25, Cycle A

It is confirmed. My ears are a little longer. I want to test if this is because
the last thing I was looking at while in the void was the back of head, or if if
it is because I didn’t keep my shape together properly. I can not think of any
safe way to test this though.

I checked the vitals of everyone in the crew. We’re all perfectly healthy,
though we’ve also all lost a little bit of weight. This was expected, without
being held down as rigorously as we were on Nirn, so I’m not worried.

The blue streak is still in sight. I wonder if we might see other color
variations the further we get away from Nirn.

On that note, I think I might have figured out a way to make sure we are not
caught by surprise again by any Daedric entity. I will have to confer with
Llevan.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
