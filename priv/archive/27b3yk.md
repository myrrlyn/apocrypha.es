We have seen many mentions of the Scarab in TES, but not any analyses on what it
is outside of Amaranth hunts. But probably the most well known usage is The
Scarab that Transforms into the New Man. What could this possibly mean? Let’s
put our scholar hats on and take a look.

In Egyptian mythology, the scarab is probably one of the most iconic pieces of
imagery. “What is so special about a dung beetle?” you might ask. The Egyptians
viewed the Scarab as symbolic of their eternal souls. They believed that
everything that happens in nature is symbolic or a myth echo of a divine
imprint. So of course they used natural phenomena to understand the
metaphysical.

Still wondering where the dung comes into play?

First google images of egyptian iconography of the Scarab. Usually it’s shown
underneath a Sun. Dung beetles’ entire lives revolve around the dung balls they
move around. Adult scarabs roll dung around, in which their offspring is inside
until they mature and can emerge to fly away. Egyptians saw this representing
mortals trapped in the physical world, until they can finally emerge
transformed. I think already, you can see the parallels in play here.

> “Take this key and pierce the divine shell that encloses the mantle-takers!
> The skin of Gold! SCARAB AE AURBEX!”

Often, divinity is described as golden, kind of like the sun. Which in Egyptian
mythology, is the source of divine radiance. It’s worth noting that the life
cycle of the scarab is comparable to Egyptian mythos of ascendence. The dung
beetle gaining it’s wings and flying away was representative of a mortal dying
and rebirth in another reality.

Of course, piercing the divine shell has been done before, in different ways.
Anu slept in the sun and dreamed the universe we all know and love which is the
ultimate act of the Scarab. Myth echos trickle down when Auriel ascended to the
Sun and pierced it, attaining the divine mantle and skin of gold, becoming
Auri-El.

> “We pledge ourselves to you, the Frame-maker, the Scarab: a world for us to

So how does the Scarab transform into the New Man? Well, first I’d like to posit
the possibility that this New Man isn’t the New Man that becomes Amaranth.
Remember, the Scarab that Transforms into the New Man is an attempt at Amaranth
that didn’t succeed. Beyond that, where does the scarab imagery originate?
Yokuda. Where hate for Lorkhan was arguably the strongest among men. Why did the
Yokudans hate Lorkhan?

Yokudans were cut off from the Far Shores by Sep, who tricked them and betrayed
them. They were forced to die and live on through their children and condemn
them to the same fate. Not only that, they were forced to live through Kalpas,
myth echos of Satakal eating himself over and over again. Alway reminded of
Sep’s betrayal and the forsaking of their people by Tall Papa. Unlike the dung
beetle, they will never know escape unless they find a new way.

It is up to the Redguards to find the way back, to make the Scarab Transform so
they might reach the Far Shores again. So they might, the steps have been taken
before, albeit mundanely. If any of you have played TESA:Redguard, you may
remember that [Scarab puzzle][8]. If you haven’t played it, look it up.
Seriously. It’s a [Scarab][5] that Cyrus has to jump around to make it
[transform][6] into a [New Man][7]. Upon its transformation, a door is unlocked
for Cyrus to continue. Kind of sounds like jumping to the Far Shores. Cyrus very
well may have stumbled onto something in that dungeon that could save his people
from the misery of their imprisonment within the Mundus and finally wave the big
“fuck you” stick at Sep for the glory of Tall Papa.
