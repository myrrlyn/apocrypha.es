Day 28, Cycle B

Provisioning came and went without much issue. I put in a request for the metal
springs necessary to make the sensor. I was also given a bit of a reprimand.
Aside from taking our vitals, I haven’t done any of the experiments I was
supposed to do. Even that wasn’t for the Empire, but because I was concerned
about our reaction to the Void.

I will have to remind the others to finish their reports. We’ve had a crazy
month, yes, but we’ve had enough off days for them to do their jobs. I don’t
know what’s the hold up.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
