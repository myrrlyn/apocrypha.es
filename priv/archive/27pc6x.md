  A [sestina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sestina#Form) about King Lysandus.
  The sestina originated in medieval Aquitaine, so it seemed the perfect form
  for a Breton bard.

Hearken the tale of royal blood
Most fouly spilt, and of th' unrest
That from the grave summons the ghost
Of Old Lysandus; the late king,
Slyly fell'd by Orken dagger,
Clamours "Revenge!" in Daggerfall.

![Clamours “Revenge!” in Daggerfall[0]

---

His ghostly host, after night-fall,
Such grave fright spread, to curdle blood,
Pursuing by spectral dagger.
From Daggerfall unto Wayrest,
Sentinels nightly spy the king
From death return'd, [an accurs'd ghost.][1]

---

Lysandus, 'fore he gave up ghost,
And was yet king of Daggerfall,
A great host led against the king
Of Sentinel. They shed much blood
O'er Beton Isle, sowing unrest,
In Iliac Bay, [at drawn dagger.][2]

---

Before Cryngaine, sharp'ning dagger,
The field a-mist, thick as a ghost,
Each knight prepares, lays lance in rest,
[Ready for war, in line they fall.][3]
Yet, that day's battle's first-shed blood
Cours'd blue through the veins of the king.

![alt text][3]

---

The hidden truth of the late king
Is riddled with cloak-and-dagger;
[A secret writ in royal blood,][4]
Whisper'd quietly, as a ghost.
Let naught of it in wrong ears fall
Lest ye likewise be laid to rest:

---

Crafty [Lord Woodborne of Wayrest][5]
Arranged for [Orcs to slay the king:][6]
The foulest fate e'er to befall
A royal soul. Hack'd by dagger,
Crush'd by club. Buried, in cold blood,
Unblest. Thus curs'd, awoke the ghost.

![Lord Woodborne of Wayrest][5]

![Orcs to slay the king][6]

O, RESTLESS CURSE OF DAGGERFALL!
TO SEAL [THE TOMB OF THE KING'S GHOST][7]
CAUSE THOU TO FALL THE TRAITOR'S BLOOD.
