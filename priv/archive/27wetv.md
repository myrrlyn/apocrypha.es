_\[Attachment: This extremely beneficial text informs us of the existence of the
dangerous Plague Atronach, as well as the plane they come from. This writing was
originally found in Coldharbour, and seems to point to a skirmish between the
Taskmaster and the King of Rape that happened somewhat recently.\]_

If one would have asked me if there would ever be Plague Atronachs somewhere in
the Master’s realm, I would’ve beaten them to death with my bare hands. Those
servants of that Sewer Keeper residing in Coldharbour? Bah!

But now we’ve got one, and it’s receiving special treatment by the Dread Lord in
one of his special prisons. The Sewer Keeper and our Master are usually on
strict business terms. But apparently, the former believed that the Master had
wronged him in one of their transactions and so the Dread Lord had to show him
whose boss. The Atronach? A little trophy to savor the victory.

Plague Atronachs themselves hail from DOP 28974, known as the Blighted Nexus to
themselves. It was assimilated under the rule of the Sewer Keeper (I would call
him the Taskmaster, but the use of this insult is rare and I don’t want to miss
out on using it) and the inhabitants serve no Lord but him.

They appear as a swirling mass of dark green particles, with their limbs being
made out of semi-solid light green fluid. Their eyes are also light green, and
they have the same height but slimmer build than Storm Atronachs. Look a bit
wimpy, don’t they? Just like their master eh? Well, think again. You see, one of
these Atronachs can split itself into twos and then into fourths without much
thought. Which is why the Master keeps them in chains that keep them that
special type of clean that stops them from pulling that kind of dirt on us.

So if you ever wanted to mock one of these cretins before in your life, you can
think again on that too. Only the Dread Lord has exclusive privileges to its
holding cell and absolutely no one else. I’ve heard talk that the Master is
trying to convince them to swear fealty to him, but I secretly hope that’s
untrue; they have a terrible smell about them.
