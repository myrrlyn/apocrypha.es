  Hello everyone, this is my first attempt at creating some apocrypha. While I
  would love to keep my overall scheme secret, I’m more than willing to give
  that up in favor of guidance and insight. I was motivated to begin this series
  due to a need for further study of Yokudan/Redguard religion and mythos, and
  to improve my research and writing.

  Essentially, this is the story of what happens when a God of War’s dreams
  become nightmares – eternal duel and war. Thus, a “battle of the week” style
  series where different entities are pitted against the other. Of course, I
  hope to subtly use Vaermina’s dialogue to advance an overarching plot.

  I would love to know what everyone thinks and see your suggestions – I’ve
  decided to abstain from big “plot” planning until I can see what everyone’s
  reactions are.

The Spectator awoke to a blackness, then there was the voice of a thousand
torments in his mind.

“Welcome, my very intriguing, unwilling, spectator. It seems you’ve spun the
Wheel in the wrong direction and wound up between a spoke and a hard place – or,
rather, my realm.

Welcome to the land of a succulent putrid compost of the souls of damned dreams.
To the land of unfortunate happenstance confounding your pitiful goals to the
amenities of your war.

Welcome to Quagmire, you whose reach is veiled in black metal.

Welcome to Quagmire, you who have supported those fanciful and melodic
swordsmen.

Welcome to Quagmire, you who pursues infidels. You, who pursues me.

What an unfortunate quagmire you’ve found yourself in. Your dreams have no
chance to escape – their feet sunken, trapped, submerged under a dervish
quagmire. My Quagmire.

Welcome to your nightmares, I’m your wonderful host – the Daedroth summoned only
by the allure of sleeping innocence, the Grifter and Gifter of the Dream, the
Weaver of the Panoply of Cries and Screams, the Prince of Nightmares, Dreams,
and Omens.

You may call me Vaermina, and I’ve finally got a chance to enjoy your beautiful
dreams of warm sands, war, and Swordsingers.

I’ve got you, you tarnished Black Night.

I’ve got you, Ebonarm.”

And the Spectator dreamed, and he dreamed terrible things. War.
