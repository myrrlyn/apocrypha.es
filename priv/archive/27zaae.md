Faolan and Andoe made their way to the water of the Karth. There Andoe helped
Faolan down, so that he was submerged to the wound in his chest. Hérnach
-Healing Hand-, a priest from the local temple saw them, and made his way down.

He spoke: _Greetings, travellers. Who might you be, and what is your interest in
these waters._{:tag="q"}

Andoe spoke: _Greetings, priest. I am Andoe the messenger, and this is king
Faolan._{:tag="q"}

Faolan interrupted them: _I am no king anymore, Andoe. Héstram made sure of
that. Priest, I am wounded, and in the hope that the waters of the Karth might
heal me. My battle has been fought, but it is not yet over, and I plan on coming
out victorious._{:tag="q"}

Hérnach replied: _Greetings then, messenger Andoe and king Faolan. I am Hérnach,
and the highest priest of this humble temple. We still worship the Old Gods,
even though our lord does not. You are both welcome here, and we will see what
we can do about the wounds._{:tag="q"}

Hérnach sat down at the waterside, examining Faolan’s cuts and bruises and
wounds.

He spoke: _Most of these are not fatal, king Faolan. When my healers have
treated you, you will live the days that you still have. Your chest wound is
another concern. From what I see, it was given to you by a proud woman, one
which is of royal statute, more so now._{:tag="q"}

Faolan replied: _That is correct. These wounds were given to me by Héstram, who
rules the Reach now, for she has conquered them and calls them her own. Is there
anything your healers can do for me?_{:tag="q"}

Hérnach replied: _We can let you rest here for three months, and then you will
live for how many days you still have left, or we can heal you for three nights,
and you will be able to fight the armies of Héstram. You will not live for long
this way, and you will definitely not be able to best Héstram in single
combat._{:tag="q"}

Faolan replied: _The latter then, for I cannot wait three months. If it takes my
life, so be it._{:tag="q"}

_Andoe, my trusted messenger, go to the other kings, and see if any of them is
willing to help me in my effort. If they do not want to help me, see if any of
their warriors or heroes or champions are able to help. I will take the fight to
the queen of the South once again, as long as I have men._{:tag="q"}

This is what Andoe did. He went to Rénach of Karth and Mashuig of Dráchstáir and
Cíer of the Leap and Fernhete of Sian Háirgramen and Huithar of Karthwasten and
Fedelm of Réchthabd and Máithramail of Némach and Balgadb of Badb. All replied
that they would not help Faolan, for the Gods of Héstram had healed their
injuries. Andoe did find warriors and heroes and champions [most which weren’t
in the fighting previously] willing.

Then Andoe went to the grave of Léech, which was inconspicuous. There he
conjured the ghost of Léech [which some said was still walking around].

Andoe said: _king Léech of Sian Spír Flach, I summon you to help us in our hour
of need. Faolan requests help in his strive against Héstram, and the other kings
do not want to help him. I did find warriors and heroes and champions, but not
enough to pose a real threat._{:tag="q"}

The ghost replied: _I am afraid I cannot help you directly. I am dead, and my
body is destroyed. My ghost is still too young to help young warriors. I can
haunt my former men into helping Faolan, for I do not agree with the Gods of
Héstram as well, even though I used to love them all. Go with my blessing,
Andoe, and tell your lord of the words spoken here. I offer any help I
can._{:tag="q"}

Andoe heeded these words, and went back to Faolan.

In these three days, Faolan had recovered enough to bring the fight back to the
armies. He had been training in the sword-feats and the shield-feats and the
javelin-feats again, but his strength and mind weren’t the same. He was still
weak, and every battle would be a strain on his body.

Andoe came into the temple, where Faolan and Hérnach were.

He spoke: _My king, I have found men that are willing to stand with you against
Héstram. I did not get the other kings to work, for the Gods of Héstram have
healed them of their wounds. The only king that wanted to offer aid was Léech,
but he is dead._{:tag="q"}

Faolan was grim, and spoke: _Well then, if none of them would help me, I will do
it myself. Tell the men to prepare. I am healed enough to fight armies, but not
strong enough to fight the Héstram one on one. Tell them that we will fight
differently. We will strike pre-emptively, and without warning. We will destroy
Héstram one man at a time. It is a coward’s move, and not a warrior’s, I know,
but we have little choice._{:tag="q"}

This was what Andoe did. He told the men what Faolan’s plan was, and all agreed
that it was necessary.
