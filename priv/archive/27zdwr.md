**Malbioge, Lyg. 2E881**

_It is a time of upheaval. Lyg is undergoing its latest transformation. The only
lasting peace to be found is within the floating haven of Malbioge, the old City
of Chains. Within the sanctum of their Tower, the Seers take measure of the city
around them. All is quiet until a shriek cries out in the distance. One of the
Seers moves towards a panel and speaks to it. Above his head, Lygian script
appears, trailing fire. Out of the terminal a thoughtform appears, displaying
the shriek’s origin point._

**Seer 1:** “There. You see that Hormer?”

**Seer 2:** “What is happening to him? Has he lost his mind?”

_The Hormer in the thoughtform is chasing an Arkayn Legionnaire across the city
plaza. Noxious gas emits from his mouth and his skin has begun to decompose._

**Rotten Hormer:** “Too afraid to fight me? Just as your mother was too afraid
to raise you, eh? HA! She says she doesn’t regret it either!”

**Arkayn Legionnaire:** “Get away from me! How are you still alive!? I’ve
stabbed you three times! Help!!!”

**Rotten Hormer:** “There is not a corner in this world you can hide from your
own miserable despair! You will be joined with your mother you love so much. In
death.”

_The thoughtform dissipates. The Seers are flabbergasted._

**Seer 1:** “Never have we seen anything like this. Assemble the Paladins of
Merid. Tell them another Deadite needs putting down. Bring his body to our
chambers for study.

**Seer 2:** “At once.”

**Malbioge, Lyg. 2E881- Next day**

_The Seers are gathered in one of the vaults of their Tower, overlooking the
dismembered corpse of the Hormer from the previous night._

**Seer 2:** “The Paladins say they had trouble putting the creature down. Many
were infected and removed themselves from the field of battle, seeking healing
from their Mother. The Deadite seemed almost possessed, though by what, we could
not ascertain. They seemed almost mindless, without a guide to direct them.”

**Rotten Head of the Deadite:** “Our sleep has been disturbed. Our ancient
slumber defiled. The time of awakening is at hand and you will all die and be
reborn in fire! Soon, all of you will be like me, sleeping in the center. Then
who will lock me up in their vault?”

_One of the Seers stabs the head with his spear and it no longer speaks its
blasphemy. From the wound, cybernetic, coagulated blood spills down its head._

**Seer 1:** “What is this blaspemy? It is against every law we uphold to alter
one’s self such as this!”

**Seer 2:** “Should we contact the Triumvirate of Horma-Gile? Their expertise in
necromancy could help.”

**Seer 1:** “Have you lost your mind as well? This information remains with us.
We cannot afford to disrupt the glorious reawakening of Lyg with unconfirmed
threats of a Deadite scourge.”

**Seer 2:** “Very well.”

**Seer 1:** “This council is dismissed.”
