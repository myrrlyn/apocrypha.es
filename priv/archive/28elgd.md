Faolan’s men had gone Hunting. They would strike Héstram’s camps and forts at
night, only to disappear at Dawn. When they would appear during day time, they
would strike before Héstram’s men saw them. Their attacks were fierce, and no
man escaped them alive. When a Reachman would be captured by a man of the South,
Faolan would come and slaughter the camp. This way, Héstram lost two battalions,
and Faolan none of his men.

Héstram entered Tulír’s tent, and spoke: _Tulír, I have need of your blessing.
We are fighting an irregular war here, and I am afraid we will lose if they keep
up this battle. Now, more than ever, I require your blessing and your
advice._{:tag="q"}

Tulír replied: _Ask me not for a blessing, but Kai. He is the one I serve, and
the one that is kind to you and your people. I can give you advice, however.
Fighting their war is a fool’s errant. Maybe we are cursed, and this war is
proving to be an unjust war. My advise is to retreat, and to leave the Reach to
its savage folk, so that we might leave this godsforsaken land._{:tag="q"}

Héstram replied: _Never! None of my ancestors, from my father and mother to the
first of my blood, which was Alesh, has ever retreated because they could not
keep up with their enemies. I will only retreat when the last of my men lies in
the dirt of the Reach, and even then will I fight to keep that which is now
mine. Saying otherwise is treason, and I expected more from you,
Tulír._{:tag="q"}

Orcí crept out of the shadow in the corner, stuck to a rolling chair. He spoke:
_There might be another way, queen. Each army in the Reach is only as strong as
their commander. The Reachmen lack the tact and discipline of the men of the
South. If we were to kill Faolan, his armies would fall, and you will be the
true ruler of the Reach._{:tag="q"}

Héstram said: _Fine then. Orcí, you are not fit to kill Faolan. Have someone
search the camp for our craftiest and most roguish men. Have them hunt Faolan,
and have them bring me the Eagle’s head._{:tag="q"}

This is what was done. Many thieves and rogues and nightblades made their way to
Faolan’s camps, and tried to hunt or assassinate or poison Faolan. What they
didn’t know, was that Faolan’s men were now masters of the Hunt, and they knew
how to read tracks and spot signs of sabotage. Every man of the South that tried
to kill Faolan was caught. That evening, Faolan stood on the hill overlooking
Héstram’s camp, holding nine heads in his hands.

Héstram spoke: _That did not work, Orcí. I don’t want this kind of weak plans
anymore. If you have any other plans, spit them out, so that we may finally get
rid of Faolan._{:tag="q"}

Orcí replied: _There is one other thing we could try to get rid of Red-Eagle. We
could try killing him in single combat. He is still wounded from your last
encounter, and I doubt he will be able to best all our champions. He is bound by
our warrior custom to accept these challenges._{:tag="q"}

Héstram said: _Fine then. Search our camp for our best warriors and heroes and
champions. Let them make their way to Faolan’s camp, and take him on in single
combat._{:tag="q"}

This what was done. Many warriors and heroes and champions made their way to
Faolan’s camp. What they didn’t know, was that Faolan’s men were masters of the
Hunt. They knew how to stalk their prey, and take down one that was twice their
size and thrice their strength. Only one champion, Lúg , was able to reach
Faolan’s camp. He was carrying armour of Dwemer craft, with a longsword and a
shield three times his own size. He held eight heads in his hand, each wearing
the head of a stag over their own. When Faolan saw him, he made way to the ford
that led to his camp. There he met Lúg.

Faolan spoke: _Who are you, what are you doing here, and why are you carrying
the heads of my men. Normally I would have offered you peace and hospitality,
but it seems you will only bring war and enmity._{:tag="q"}

Lúg replied: _I was sent by the queen of the South to have single combat with
Faolan, who says he rules the Reach. The only ones I met were those cowardly
enough to hide their faces, and you are no exception. Tell me your name, and the
way to your master._{:tag="q"}

Faolan replied: _I am king Faolan, and I am the Eagle of your death. I do not
hide my face, but wear this to better know my pray. You are all proud, but in
the end are all the hunted, and not the hunter. If you want single combat, go
ahead. You will find this here._{:tag="q"}

This is what was done. Lúg threw the heads in the river, so that their names
might be remembered [Suibhne, Suibhne, Gláess, Fiachna, Róeich, Fergus, Lechan,
Sebhthagh]. He took up his shield and sword, and stood on his side of the ford.

Faolan was now using two swords, so to better move through the forest.

Faolan spoke: _I do not want to fight you, forced like this. I am, however,
bound by honour to comply. You are the challenger, so you may move
first._{:tag="q"}

Lúg charged Faolan. When he thought he was sure to hit, Faolan had moved away.
From sunrise to midday, Faolan had done nothing more than dodging, and Lúg grew
tired. Faolan lashed out, cutting both Lúg’s calves. Lúg collapsed.

Faolan spoke: _Even though I am still wounded by Héstram, I seem to have no
problem beating you, Lúg. If Héstram wants to beat me, she needs better
men._{:tag="q"}

Faolan cut off Lúg’s head, and with all his strength he threw it towards
Héstram’s camp. Lúg’s head rolled into Héstram’s tent, and it repeated the words
Faolan spoke.

Héstram stood up, and said: _It seems the Eagle is now taunting me. Orcí, get
your gear. We will help you on your horse, given you will beat
Faolan._{:tag="q"}
