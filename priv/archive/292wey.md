name and Name, and tossed the broken, hardly dead carcass of the talking evil
across the glass steps of the Laconic Spike where he bled blood that smoked in
the air.

And as Silent God went to finish off the false brother, Maztiax descended from
the purple sky of Aelseny in both defiance and breakage of the invisible laws
that had existed since the untimes and stole the half-dead HRAHN-DEYL across the
nineteen and nine and nine oceans where he knew LYEDNHARH would not be able to

scream that threatened to tear his world asunder, for he knew that his false
brother would be safe in the legions of all the Get that bore a name and be

But Silent God was still fuming from his defeat, and so he ripped up the ruined
