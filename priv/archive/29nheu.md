Faolan made way to Héstram’s camp.

Andoe came to Faolan and spoke: _King Faolan, the troops are not yet ready for
the Hunt, and they will not be a match for Héstram in traditional combat.
Shouldn’t we wait, and stick to our successful ways?_{:tag="q"}

Faolan replied: _The troops might not be ready, but I am. Tell them to watch on
yonder hill. I will show Héstram the might of the Reach._{:tag="q"}

Faolan began shaking with rage. His arms and legs and neck and torso became
wider and bigger, so that Faolan stood well over two feet above Andoe. His hands
were clenched in fists, and he broke nine javelins with his strength. The
exposed Briarheart in his chest was beating with more force than his original
heart could, and it broke three ribs in the process. Then, the warps began.
Faolan’s muscles began distorting and shifting, so that he looked more like a
force of nature than a man. Great fire and frost shot from every hole of his
body, or made new holes through his flesh. From the stag head on his own, one
could hear his teeth clashing with the force of mountains, and spurts of blood
shot out through the stag head. Faolan led out a howl that was heared throughout
every corner of the Reach, from Dráchstáir to the Leap, and from there to Sian
Háirgramen and back again. His howl lasted for more than an hour, and echoed
through the Reach for more than three weeks.

At this time, Héstram’s men had heard Faolan, and were at the ready. When they
saw the lone king on the hill, they started laughing. One soldier commented:
_What is that dumb and petty man thinking? Is he hoping to take on the mighty
Legions of the South all by himself?_{:tag="q"}

Orcí, who was inspecting troops when it happened, said: _Hold your tongue, dumb
boy. That there is Faolan, or used to be him. As a normal man he could take on
any of you a hundred fold, and live to tell about it. He seems different now,
and I advice you all to stay ready._{:tag="q"}

Orcí was ignored. Angry, he made way to Héstram’s tent, hoping that she would
listen to his reason.

Faolan heard the soldiers laughing, and it made his rage more potent. The hairs
of his beard were standing upright, each tense enough to break the mountains of
the Reach. Every drop of blood was filled with Magicka and rage, and each was
potent enough to crack the earth beneath him. Faolan could no longer contain his
rage, and that was when the fighting started.

He flung his javelins at the soldiers below, each followed by fire and frost and
lightning. Before the first javelin landed, the sun was blotted out by Faolan’s
javelin and magicka feats. Before the soldiers stopped laughing, they were all
dead. The ones that were resting or stationed at the other side of the camp
heard the rumble, and rose to their feet and grabbed their arms and armour. They
saw their dead comrades on the ground, their heads split open by javelins and
their bowels scattered throughout the camps. Some were scattered completely by
fire or lightning or frost. Some of the living vomited at this sight. They took
position, albeit scared stiff.

Faolan was now out of javelins, and drew his swords. His rage had only increased
by the smell and sight of blood. He ran down the hill with the speed of the
winds, and caught every arrow shot at him. He carved a path through the enemy
ranks, and circled the camp nine times, so that no man could flee. By doing this
he made the palisade of the Reach, which was a wall of bodies, headless torso
against severed neck, three high. After his ninth round, he went back in the
camp to slaughter the remaining troops. The bards and poets that were in
Héstram’s camp were almost all slaughtered, and the remaining either fainted or
were wounded, so that no one could accurately account the massacre. This was the
greatest slaughter in the Rape of the Reach.

The following morning, the remainder of Héstram’s forces tried cleaning up the
camp. They burned or buried the bodies laying around. There were so many that
count was lost, but it is thought that Héstram lost at least twenty battalions
that night. No man was left unscathed; they either lost a limb, or an eye, or
had broken bones, bruised limbs, heart conditions, or were damaged in another
way.

Faolan, thinking his form the previous day was hideous, had made effort to look
his best. He took up position on the same hill as yesterday. His black beard was
braided three fold, and a nine fold ribbons were placed in his fair hair, in
beautiful disorganisation. His skin was clean, and showed no signs of the
previous battle. In each hand he held nine heads, each from one of Héstram’s
legates. He held them high above his head, to show his triumph to Héstram’s
forces.

Faolan’s troops, who had seen the battle of the previous day, stood behind him.
As much as Héstram’s men were shocked by the show of power, so were Faolan’s.
They did not recognise their king in this form, nor did they recognise their own
commanders, for they were Bráircór as well. Unruly and Uneasy, they stood behind
their king, hoping to never wrong him or never upset him, for they were wary of
his might.

Héstram looked out at the hill, and spit at the ground. She yelled: _This is
low, Faolan, that you must show your spoils of war to us, who have suffered by
your unearthly rage._{:tag="q"}

Without saying a word, Faolan dropped the heads, so that they rolled down the
hill towards Héstram. Meanwhile, he picked up a stone, and flung it with such
force at the horse Héstram was seated on that its brains covered Héstram’s
White-Gold armour. Héstram jumped of the collapsing horse and spit at the ground
again before turning her back at Faolan without saying another word.
