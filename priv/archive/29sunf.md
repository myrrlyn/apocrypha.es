You may had thought I had died or given up my adventures, dear reader. You are
thus happily mistaken, for nothing could kill the mighty Rothras – not a
murk-beast of Black Marsh nor a troll of cold Skyrim!

This is my second account of one of my adventures, and it happened not too long
after our first deadly adventure![^1] As you know, I sustained serious wounds
and found myself stumbling into a lost and forlorn Temple of Arkay in the Alik’r
Desert. What happened in that lone Temple is a tale worthy of my readers!

I cannot recall what happened when I collapsed through the doors to that Temple,
but I awoke to a Redguard priest chanting under his breath. He was pouring a
salt solution over me, and I laid in a large sarcophagus. Imagine my outrage,
reader! They were going to inter me, instead of giving me my rightful return to
the ash!

I gasped as I was recalled to life, and the Redguard jerked back in surpise and
dropped the ewer of the solution onto my head. I fell once again into
unconsciousness. I soon awoke again and the blasted fool was repeating the
rights, thinking I was dead – again!

This time I grabbed the ewer and proceeded to bid the Three Goodly Daedra to
curse the stupid priest. “Do you not know how to tell if a mer yet lives?
Foolish priest!”

The priest recovered from the shock of his twice-revived subject and humbly
bowed, “My apologies, sir. I am most humbled to be in your mighty presence, my
attempts to inter you were most foolish.”[^2]

“Where am I? I must return to Taneth at once, I have quite the bounty waiting
for me to collect!” The priest bowed again, and spoke “You are in the Alik’r
Temple of Arkay, we provide the Law and Ritual of Arkay to the nomads of the
desert.”

“Yes, but where am I?”

“Sir, the Alik’r is an ocean and the sands upon which we are based shift as the
currents.”

What did I expect, dear reader, other than such a confusedly primitive outlook?

“Yes, yes, and I’m an ash vampire. If you don’t wish to help me, I’ll rely on
the help of the stars.”

I rose out of the basin and walked towards the massive set of stone doors that
marked the exit. The priest gasped and grabbed a hold of me. “Sir, you mustn’t
open the doors, it would do horrible things to the air in here and my subjects
are terribly delicate.”

I swatted the fool’s hand away from me, and opened the doors. Reader, I must
admit the folly of my choice, as when I opened the doors I was hit with a blast
of sand that threw me backwards. The air around me screamed with the presence of
the many particles of sand, and I had to force myself up and slam shut the
doors. The priest’s robes were frayed and he was coughing up the sand he had
accidentally breathed.

“You damned fool, you have ruined two year-long projects. Do you have any idea
of the necessities to prepare bodies for utilization?!” The priest ran over to
two open coffins and spat on the corpses, “By the Worm King, you’ve broken the
salt barrier and exposed the corpse to the elements! Do you have _any_ idea have
difficult it is to find bodies in this hot hellhole – let alone bodies of the
descendants of the Ansei!”

The priest whipped around and glared at me, while I held an admittedly confused
visage. “You’ll pay for this you idiotic Dark Elf.” I was, to say the least,
insulted – but still confused, “So, you’re not a priest?”

“Gods no! Honestly, has my Lord become so censored that the common-folk don’t
know his name? I am a servant of Mannimarco, God-King of Worms, Bane of Arkay,
Bringer of Unlife!” As he spoke, he began channeling profane magics, and
blackness began to storm around his hands.

When confronting a necromancer, reader, you must always think of your
environment and the amount of possible bodies available to the foul sorcerer. I
was unfortunate to be without my blade and in a temple devoted to the interment
and preservation of bodies.

Without my blade, I would have to face the necromancer with the power of the
arcane arts, and so I did what any rational person would do when faced with a
necromancer in a burial crypt – I used my experience in Illusion to cast a cloak
of invisibility over myself.

The necromancer was unfazed, and the blackness of his right hand quickly
transformed into a blue wave. I was not sure what he was doing until I looked
down and saw that my invisible frame was actually emanating a blue aura. Curses!
A spell for the detection of life. No matter, I released my cloak and began to
channel the power of lightning.

The ground under me rumbled, which I attributed incorrectly to the sandstorm,
and I struck at the priest with a bolt of lightning. The bolt was blocked by a
skeletal hand that shot up out of the ground. More began to shoot out of the
ground around me and grab hold of my legs. Servants of flesh began to emerge
from the labyrinthine tunnels that descended into what must have been the
necromancer’s store of subjects.

The normal adventurer would begin to panic, but not a mighty Telvanni Spellsword
such as myself. I thought back onto my training against the Black Arts, and
remembered that both fire magic and restoration magic are effective against the
undead. A single consecrated blast would leave me defenseless, but would be the
only way to eliminate the hoards of undead.

So, instead of fighting, I succumbed to the forces, and covered myself in a
ward. That foolish necromancer was haughty, and decided to flex his entire
undead force to pile on and around me. Exactly what I wanted.

It took nearly an hour’s time before I sensed that all the necromancer’s forces
were marshalled around me – it must have been over three hundred undead minions.
They were pounding away at each to reach me, but the ones nearest to me were
repelled by my ward. The premise of my plan was easy, to imbue the ward with an
element of fire and then to rapidly expand the ward’s space. A fiery explosion
that I hoped would also capture the necromancer in it’s blast.

I began to channel fire magicks into the ward, and quickly funneled all my
stores of magicka into the ward, rapidly expanding it and forcing back the
undead forces. A catastrophic boom echoed down the tunnels as I stood in the
center of a mass of dead bodies.[^3]

I saw a hand pop out of the mass of bodies, which began to channel the black
magicks. I quickly grabbed a ceremonial burial scimitar from one of the bodies
and walked over to the hand. I raised the blade and sliced off the hand, before
kicking aside the body the necromancer hid under and impaling him with an
efficient plunge.

And that is how I killed the Necromancer masquerading as a Priest of Arkay in
the Alik’r desert.

[^1]: The editor would like to note that Arlugbur was, chronologically, not
Rothras’ first adventure – rather, it was his first listed in his ordering
documents. As previously mentioned, the listing system is nonsensical but
maintained for sake of posterity. The editor would also, for posterity, like to
point out the irony of Rothras’ introduction.

[^2]: The editor would like to point out that no burial rituals of Arkay,
specifically in Hammerfell, utilize a salt solution in an ewer poured over the
subject in a basin.

[^3]: I consulted with a destruction mage in the College of Whispers and gave
him a description of the technique used by Rothras which upon hearing he grew
incredibly pale (for a Redguard.) After rushing me into a backroom filled with
tattered scrolls and broken alembics, he whispered to me in a hushed tone:
“These magicks, wards infused with destruction, are secrets of the Elder Council
– not yet deemed of proper safety to be released by the public. However you
gained access to this magic, know this, my superiors will kill you if their
secrets pass from thought to whisper.” That was two years ago, and at the time
of release I’m sure any well educated person would know of the recent release of
_Wards as Offense: Treatise of Destruction-Restoration and Workings of the
Magicks Involved_ by the College of Whispers.
