Before the release of C0DA, there was a post on MK’s tumblr hyping it up. One of
the tags on the post was “The Name of the Nerevarine”, implying that it would be
revealed at some point in the course of the narrative. Now, a simple “is”
statement is not MK’s style, and the chances of a straight answer were virtually
zero (unless the whole time C0DA was a piece of software that found your oldest
Morrowind save and told you the name of the character). Now, lacking an obvious
suspect for Nerevarine, I, and some others, pointed to the main character,
Jubal-lun-Sul. The obvious response to that assertion is “Jubal was born in the
Velothiid”. My counter-argument is this: he is the _other_ reincarnation of
Nerevar.

Now, we all know that it is not strictly true that the Nerevarine was the
reincarnation of Nerevarine, but it seems nearly certain that the Nerevarine
mantled Nerevar. Accordingly, if Jubal is truly the Nerevarine, then he would be
required to mantle Nerevar. So, let’s map out the parallels.

## Absent Parents

Nerevar’s parents are not known to history. While normally it would be fair to
disregard this, we have to remember that the Velothi have the most intensive
respect for the ancestors. That Nerevar’s parents are absent is, on it’s own,
merely an oddity, but given that it may be part of a pattern elevates it above
mere coincidence. Obviously we know him as “Indoril Nerevar”, but people around
here seem to think that “Indoril” existed as a title before it was a house, and
the house was named after Nerevar.

Those who’ve played Morrowind know well: “Born on an uncertain day to uncertain
parents.” The Nerevarine’s parents are not known.

Jubal-lun-Sul is a wealthy bachelor. His parents, whoever they were, are unnamed
and dead. One can tell they are dead or permanently out of the picture given
that Jubal has evidently inherited their property. He may be descended from
Haeko-dol-Sul, but the phrasing leaves it ambiguous and still doesn’t account
for Jubal’s parents.

In short: we never hear about the parents of either of these three figures.

## Azura Connection

I know, I know. “The Anticipations/Reclaimations/Good Daedra are not present in
C0DA.” Written out of history and whatnot (except for Mephala, apparently, who
appears in a Thirysix Lessons quote). But until some light is shed on the
situation, all we have are some spooky phrases tied to Dies Irae. And chances of
Dies Irae meeting our expectations are near zero, so until it’s revealed
factoring it into speculation is useless.

Now, Nerevar and the Nerevarine were sent by Azura. This is a point that
deserves little argument. Of course the Nerevarine was in no way bound to stay
loyal to Azura, Morrowind starts and ends with a positive speech by Azura.
Jubal-lun-Sul, though, is more interesting. He has no stated connection to
Azura... except his name. In most instances, “Sul” indicates an Azura worshiper.
See: Alandro Sul, Sul-Matuul, Sul-Senipal. The major exception is Arden Sul.
Given everything we know about him, it stands to reason that he breaks rules.

Then, we have Haeko-dol-Sul. First Dunmer child born in the Velothiid, which is
on the moon. The moon, in Dunmer culture, is associated with Azura. It’s a
compelling connection, and it implies a further connection between Jubal and
Azura. However, this relationship lacks direct evidence, and even if it does
exist the nature of it is unknown.

But in short, Nerevar and the Nerevarine have Azura connections, and there is
reason to believe Jubal does too. Jubal may not even know it (he doesn’t come
across as pious), and Azura may not even exist anymore, but there is reason to
suspect there’s more to it. Or, MK could continue his evident anti-Azura bias
and utterly invalidate this analysis.

## Vivec Connection

The connection between Nerevar, the Nerevarine and Jubal-lun-Sul and Vivec is
clear. To sum it all up: Vivec acts as a mentor figure to the person in
question. But, since it’s Vivec, mentoring is less about practical skills and
more about esoteric concepts. The Thirtysix Lessons are the embodiment of
Vivec’s mentoring. Vivec initially teaches these things to Nerevar, then records
the teachings in the Thirty-Six lessons for the Nerevarine, then somehow
transmits the lessons to Jubal. He was evidently most successful with Jubal,
since Jubal went Amaranth.

## Mediator

...between the Tribunal and the Good Daedra. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say
it again: we view those groups to be in a conflict of interest. Since Azura and
Vivec are the members of those groups who get the most screentime, we see them
in particular to be at war. But there are two times when, I think, they came
together. Nerevar and the Nerevarine. In those two instances, as discussed
above, they both preformed functions critical to the success of Nerevar(ine).
This are world-changing moments: defeat of the Dwemer and of Dagoth. But when
the cooperation ends, tragedy ensues. Foul Murder, Sun’s Death, the Red Year,
transformation of the Dunmer, these are all post-cooperation spats between the
Tribunal and the Good Daedra. They’re also known as some of the worst
catastrophes in the contemporary kalpa.

So part of Nerevar(ine)’s role is to mediate between the Good Daedra and the
Tribunal. This middle path gives the Nerevarine leave to preform great deeds at
crucial moments in the history of Veloth. Until it breaks down and Red Mountain
goes up.

## Messiah Figure\*

When I first played Morrowind, it was not long after I first read Dune. The
parallels were incredible. My image of the Fremen and the Ashlanders combined,
and I fell in love with the synthesized image. What was I saying? Right, the
Nerevarine is a classic messiah figure, as is Nerevar. Enduring great peril and
trial to lead the people to victory. And then we have this quote from Jubal: “I
want a very great thing for the whole of my people. Call it a messiah complex,
if you must.” You heard it straight from him: a huge, constant trait between the
three of them.

## Numidium

Then, the last thing they all have in common is that Numidium is the greatest
threat, but at no point do they fight it physically. The Chimer declared war on
the Dwemer to destroy the abomination created with the Heart of Lorkhan. The
Nerevarine’s goal is to destroy Dagoth Ur and the Heart before the Second
Numidium can be completed. Jubal’s task to win Vivec’s hand and achieve Amaranth
is to ~~go into Morgoth’s own fortress of Angband and from his very crown
retrieve a Silmaril~~ hunt a Numidium.

## Conclusion

The parallels between Nerevar and the Nerevarine happen to also be shared with
Jubal-lun-Sul. The only missing piece of the puzzle, if my conjecture can be
accepted, is the Moon-and-Star ring.

## Post Script: Two Hypotheses on Uncertain Birth

First hypothesis: Nerevar(ine) is the closest thing to a child a Daedroth can
have. Given everything, Azura is likely the parent, but I’ll have you know I
picked the word hypothesis carefully. A hypothesis is an informed guess, less
than a theory (which requires evidence).

Second hypothesis: The Nerevarine had to be an outlander. This ties in more with
the mediator role and the Prophecy of the Stranger, but is still important. My
assertion is that the Nerevarine had to be an outlander so that s/he didn’t have
preexisting loyalties to the Good Daedra or the Tribunal, making her/him an
impartial mediator.
