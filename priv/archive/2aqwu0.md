  After MK told us that Huna in [The Song of Pelinal][0] was a man and also
  intended to be Pelinal’s lover, I found myself really interested by the
  parallels between them and Achilles and Patroklos. Additionally, since the
  biweekly theme is projectiles and Huna “took death from an arrowhead”, I wrote
  this as a quick contribution to the theme.

I lay on Cyrod’s earth with my heartbeat like a drum in my ears and an arrow in
my chest, and I thought, irrationally, _Pelinal will come_. I knew it wasn’t
true. You were not there and there was nothing you do could for me. You send men
to death; you do not bring them back. As the soil beneath me turned to red mud,
I hallucinated your face. I saw you as I first saw you, Pelinal, blood-mouthed
and glorious, burning in rage. I loved you then.

While the sky turned wine-dark overhead, the pain became cold white static and
numbed me to my fingertips. The battle-noise around me faded, and I thought of
you again; I dreamed you in the stars. Their light was the last thing I could
see. Pelin-El, all I can do now is wait for you.
