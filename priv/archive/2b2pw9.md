| Roscrean Cavern Salt      |    x    |  7 Pounds  |    x     |                                                                                                                                |
| Roscrean Good Luck Totems |    x    |  19 items  |    x     | They’re just small pieces of wood with animals carved into them. Not much of a market for these, but they made us accept them. |
