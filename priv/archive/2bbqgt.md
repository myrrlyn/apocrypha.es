  This is my take on Anu and Padomay + Amaranth/CHIM stuff, and my first post
  here that isn’t a question or “thoughts on x”. Was a little unsure about the
  last line, because I wasn’t sure if the answer is CHIM or Amaranth. The wheel
  is CHIM, but adding the sea could be Amaranth (that’s what “we is it” is
  about)? I would appreciate any corrections to my inane babbling. :P

I look out the window and see a green tree, but what I see is not part of Anu,
for it is a part of Padomay. For this reason, the tree is red, but Padomay
reflects darkness into my eye instead of light. Therefore, I see green in the
red tree of Padomay, and it sees red in the green tree of Anu, but when I know
this, how can I be red or green?

I have a bag of coins which weighs a pound, but the coin is part of Padomay,
rather than Anu. Because of this, the bag weighs a negative pound, but Padomay
is built of the absence of mass. Therefore, I hold a pound of the weightless
coins from Padomay, and it holds a negative pound of Anu’s heavy coins, but if I
know this, how can any coin have worth?

To Anu, we are a wheel in a sea of nothing. To Padomay, they are a sea with a
wheel of nothing in the center. But while we are existence, Padomay is a lack
thereof. Therefore Anu is a wheel and a sea, and so is Padomay, neither combined
nor separate, for infinity.

But in this state, what am I?

I am, and I are all we, and we is it.
