## Alomir Firefist 4E 201

I have traveled through the sands of Hammerfell to Skaven to meet our Orc
wizard, Lo-Gash. He claims to hail from Orsinium but this information has not
been verified though I see no reason to mistrust him. Upon arriving in Skaven I
met with our friend Lo-Gash at the local tavern for a drink, a luxury both Nord
and Orc enjoy. After our revelry we set off to our seperate chambers to rest for
tomorrows display of magical skill and finesse.

At first light Lo-Gash and myself set off to a clearing outside of Skaven to
begin the display of magical might. It was early and before the brutal sun of
the Alik’r began to beat down on the denizens of Hammerfell when we began.
Lo-Gash flung both fire and ice with destructive force, cascading spells upon
the rocks of the desert shattering them, spewing molten rock and shattering
boulders. The orc seemed well versed in the art of destruction and delighted in
the mayhem he spread across the sands.

When I asked him if he could show some orcish techniques in the school of
Alteration or Illusion, the light of joy in his eye vanished. He displayed some
knowledge of the schools but not nearly to the extent of his skill and passion
towards the school of Destruction. When asked later about this he said "my
fellow orcs do not view such cowardly behavior as acceptingly as the schools of
war."

It seems as though in the life of a warring orc, born and raised in the harsh
strongholds there is less room for the elegant side of the magickal arts. Though
few in number the wizards and mages amongst the orcs can be fearsome foes in
battle, but expect more hurt than healing when confronting these incredible foes
on the open field.

At dawn tomorrow we set out for High Rock, the home of the Bretons, a people
with deep roots in the arcane arts. In Volume 2 I hope to get a deeper insight
towards how the Bretons not only view magic, but how they use it.
