22 Morning Star

How long has it been since these visions have been affecting our people? I
cannot remember. The Council have asked Vulonfaasah for wisdom but the Great
Dragon has reassured us that if we continue to venerate the Dovah we will stay
safe, and in time will embrace these visions as a blessing.

The populous of the city are growing weaker, the little ones are dying in their
sleep and yet the Dragons do nothing to help us. Why, what have we done?

Whether the Dragons are behind these visions is blasphemy, surely?

> but whether this is due to this plague of nightmares I highly doubt. Perhaps a
> more likely explanation would be there had been poor harvest and they were
> dying of malnutrition.

> Another interesting point is the author thinks that the dragons are behind the

> Imperial Library for any records of a Daedric Prince personifying as a dragon,
> to which I found only one source: a [manuscript](./1ykcvs) dismissed by the
