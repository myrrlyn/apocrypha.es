Berahzic,

Crawling on your breast brings sweet music from your lips, dearest sister, but
not sweet enough to swallow the bitterness of your earlier compositions, those
you crowed while you preened atop your gilded perch. When you flew, you fancied
yourself alone as worthy of love, and now that the bill has arrived you find
yourself clutching at your empty pockets. Still, though you fled from our
volary, enclosed you will find a partitioning of feed. We hope that it will
serve to fill your beak, and that of the young devil plotting beneath your
apron. When your molting mate comes dry again, perhaps it will help stay his
claw. But do not fly back to us again; we consider this payment for your
absence.

Yours in cacophonous cackling,

Lanali
