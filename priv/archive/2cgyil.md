Sera,

First, to your immediate concerns. Yes, we have received your package, and our
archivists have determined [the letter](./2bz9tf) to be authentic. That the
author’s name is not known to you is not relevant. That the intended reader’s
name is not known to you is both right and proper.

While my department in House Redoran cannot legally exculpate your company, I
believe I can be convinced to testify that your charges might be reduced in
number, especially those in reference to the intent to distribute native
cultural artifacts for the profit of undetermined monies.

Do not mistake me. I can do this if and only if you agree to:

A) Allow my agency to examine the recovered artifacts to determine which are
relevant to the Dissident Priests and the Tribunal Cult.

B) Immediately surrender all relevant artifacts to my agents without delay or
complication.

You must do both, in total, and not less. This is not an opportunity to
negotiate, Imperial.

Do not think for one moment that we are not aware that your company continues to
dive and recover items from Scathing Bay despite, or perhaps in spite, of the
lawsuit my House has brought against you. This current political climate demands
such toothless acts, but House Redoran has long practiced other, deterministic
forms of resolution. You know of what I speak. This is not a threat, for we are
honor-bound against them. This is a _promise_.

If you wish to avoid a Redoran Negotiation, allow the agent bearing this letter
to examine what you have recovered for value, and do with them as she wills. A
word of advice: do not impede her work. Though you may try, you will most
assuredly fail.

With sharpened sincerity, and in the name of Boethiah, and of Azura, and of
Mephala,

Alammu Redoran

Head Archivist of House Redoran
