One aspect of the Trinimac story which is unquestioned is the notion that
Malacath the Daedric Prince of Scourned and God-King of Orcs was once the God
Trinimac. There is a connection between these two.

In the Nordic tradition, Orcs are considered a traditional foe. Their God,
Orkey, plays an important role in Nordic myth. One might therefore draw a link
between Orkey and Trinimac, if one assumes this being is the same Orc-God as
Malacath.

However, Orkey in Nordic tradition is considered to be more aligned with Arkay.

First, who is this Nordic Orkey?

We also hear about him here:

> The third song of King Wulfharth tells of his death. Orkey, an enemy god, had
> always tried to ruin the Nords, even in Atmora where he stole their years
> away. Seeing the strength of King Wulfharth, Orkey summoned the ghost of

> ruined.

This alone doesn’t definitively link Mauloch with Arkay, but it implies a
connection. One might say that Orkey is simply a Nordic mistake, but matters of
the divine are rarely just cultural accidents. Even so, the case isn’t made,
only implied. Why would it be implied?

Who is Arkay?

In the Cyrodiilic system, the God of the Cycle of Life and Death. There is a
specific parable concerning a shopkeeper that studied so many mysteries only to
realize that they pertained to life and death and then before his death Mara
gave him charge over life and death. ([Ark’ay, the God of Birth and Death][3]).
This is reconciled when Arkay is compared to Tu’whacca.

### Tu’whacca

The link to Arkay is strengthened by Lady Cinnabar of Taneth:

> …We begin with Xarxes, as his worship, at least as recorded in written
> history, predates that of both Arkay and Tu’whacca. An Elven deity who records

> be a reflection of Xarxes’ many-fold nature…

This overview of these Gods reveals the following, very clear, pattern:

Xarxes, Auri-El’s scribe, in his pursuit of deep mysteries, unlocks the secrets
of the cycle of life and death. He then, in the new world which now has
mortality, becomes the mortals’ god.

There are important conclusions that can be drawn from this. First, what does it
mean to be Auri-El’s scribe? To answer this, the nature of reality pre-Dawn
pre-Second Creation must be understood. Second, in what way does the Chief
Anuaic’s record keeper become a keeper of mortal life and death in the
post-Convention disaster that is Mundus and mortality? The universe changed in a
very significant way because of “Convention”. How would Xarxes have changed?

Finally, as keeper of the secrets of life and death, what is the specific
connection between Arkay and the “Far Shores”. Though this is a sensible role
for a mortality god, it seems to have grander connotation than merely keeping
the dead in their dream-sleep. Moreover, if Arkay is a fusion of Orkey the
death-god, and Xarxes, what does that mean?

And why are Orcs connected to this story?

On a final note, we must acknowledge that the Yokudans worship this “To’Arka”,
and we know for a fact that they [come from a previous Kalpa.][6]

The Altmeri “ancestors” are in fact something different than what a mortal would
reckon.

Thus, we see a number of significant Gods: Arkay, Orkey, Malacath, Trinimac,
Xarxes, Tu’Whacca; which all exist in the same orbit. Xarxes/Arkay/Tu’Whacca are
clearly linked. Trinimac and Malacath are as well. Orkey is the wild card,
relating to either Malacath or Arkay. Or perhaps both? We will understand why in
the end.

In Part II, the nature of existence prior to convention will be examined.
