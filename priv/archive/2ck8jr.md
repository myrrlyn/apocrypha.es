In part II, we discussed the nature of the spiritual beings who existed prior to
Nirn’s creation and who also played a part in it. The most important aspect of
these beings is their multi-faceted nature. They are stories and story tellers.
They represent broad categories that can be divided up into specific concretes.
They are essences. They are planes, spheres of influence that are best described
as themes that would be common to any number of stories told. They are the
themes out of which stories can be constructed. Presumably, there is an endless
host of Aetherial beings which transcribe infinite planes and themes. For
example, the Divines of Mundus describe the main themes relevant to Mundus.

Not only are the Gods themes, but they can be described as forms resolved from
those themes. The only rule for this is that the form must be appropriate for
the context. This is why Auriel is time itself, a dragon spirit, a willful
oversoul, and also an immortal Mereth giant. But Shor too is a dragon,
depending.

One of the best depictions of beings is seen in the two Nordic Apocryphae [Shor
Son of Shor][0] and [Ysgramor and His 500 Companions][1]. Mythic characters are
described as having different forms at different times. A better way of putting
this is that they are described as having different forms depending on how the
story is being told. The narrator decides the form, the Gods themselves being
multifaceted. The multifaceted nature of the divines must be understood
properly.

> The first of Ysgramor’s Five Hundred Mighty Companions was actually two, the
> ashen-amalgamation of his sons that had survived Sarthaal only to die in the
> freeze-rains of the returning, named Tsunaltir and Stuhnalmir when alive and

> Alleir, and Tusk Widow Who Foreswore Her Name, whose Wine-Wives were Elja
> Hate-Basket and Ingridal who lost her casket at the burning, and Mjarili-al
> Half-Casket, whose Hearth-Wives were none survived, and whose Kyne-Wives were
> none survived, and whose Shield-Wives were Shanjenen the Echo-Eaten and
> Jahnsdotter Whose-Name-Stays-in-its-Cradle.

So begins the tale of Ysgramor and his Five Hundred Mighty Companions. What’s
significant is how this tale ends:

> It was the World-Eater’s-Waking that broke shore first, Shouting our victory
> and doom, whose Boat-Thane was Ysmaalithax the Northerly Dragon, his
> first-clutch-sons Tsuunalinfaxtir and St’unuhaslifafnal, whose Tear-Jills were
> Vorramaalix, Jarliallisuh, Alleirisughus, and the Dewclaw Widow Who Foreswore
> Her Name, whose Void-Jills were Eljaalithathisalif Hate-Fire and Ingridaaligu
> who lost her minutes in the mending, and Mjaariliaalunax Half-Fire, whose
> Earth-Jills were none awoke, and whose Aether-Jills were none survived, and
> whose Magne-Jills were Shanu’ujeneen the Star-Woven and Jaalhngithaax
> Whose-Name-Stays-in-its-Egg.

Here the structure of introducing characters is paralleled, but in the place of
Nordic champions are powerful and eternal dragon beings. Note also the names of
these characters: Ysmir, Tsun, Stuhn, etc. Ysgramor and his host are being
conflated with the divines. While this might be an example of “weird”
storytelling, the truth is that it reveals the multi-fold nature of the eternal
narrative.

This phenomenon of characters having different forms isn’t restricted to _how_ a
story is told, but can be seen occurring _within_ as story.

Clearly, during the time, the “twilight”, between Kalpas, the precise forms of
these multifaceted beings ceases to matter as much. The multi-fold nature of
these beings is explicit in this story. We know that the spiritual beings of
before-Nirn were multifold, composed of stories and storytelling. Can we
conclude that this nature would extend to these beings’ creation? We should.
There is every reason to believe that the events of Ysgramor’s return can be
described in infinite variety. Each tale as valid and real as any other, by the
reckoning of the gods. Nevertheless, by the time of Uriel VII – at least – we
have a coherent reality that appears to have only one timeline, or something
close to it. Our goal is to discover how such a timeline could emerge from
beings whose very nature eschews the very idea of singularity.

According to Altmeri tradition, et’Ada are the limitation of powerful beings. We
see these multi-faceted forms being limited into more concrete aspects. This is
foundational to the tale of Mundus. Although the High Elves have a specific
interpretation of this truth, it remains as is.

How is it then, that the world became concrete? The simplest and most concrete
account of creation comes from [Before the Ages of Man][3]:

> The Cosmos formed from the Aurbis [chaos, or totality] by Anu and Padomay.
> Akatosh (Auriel) formed and Time began. The Gods (et’Ada) formed. Lorkhan
> convinced – or tricked – the Gods into creating the mortal plane, Nirn. The
> mortal plane was at this point highly magical and dangerous. As the Gods
> walked, the physical make-up of the mortal plane and even the timeless
> continuity of existence itself became unstable. When Magic (Magnus), architect
> of the plans for the mortal world, decided to terminate the project, the Gods
> convened at the Adamantine Tower [Direnni Tower, the oldest known structure in
> > Tamriel] and decided what to do. Most left when Magic did. Others sacrificed

> torn out and cast from the Tower. Where it landed, a Volcano formed. With
> Magic (in the Mythic Sense) gone, the Cosmos stabilized. Elven history,
> finally linear, began (ME2500).

Even this highly conventional account admits that history had to become linear,
and was originally chaotic. This fits with the idea of highly variable beings.

It’s important to point out that this account is constructed from the point of
view of scholars within history, during the ages of history, in Tamriel. Their
point of view is based entirely on what textual evidence survived history to
arrive to their present day. There is a heavy reliance on the Altmeri point of
view (the knowledge of early Tamriel very likely derived from [Father of the
Niben][4] which is interestingly the lone account of Topal the Pilot’s journey).

These scholars must be assuming a single timeline, since their present possesses
a single timeline. Imagine, though, if they are compiling accounts from
different pasts from different timelines that all somehow “washed ashore” in the
same present.

Let us examine what seems to be the bridge between the highly variable Dawn and
the static present: the Towers.

A good introduction to the Mythic Tower concept comes from [The Nu-Mantia
Intercept][5].

This discussion of towers is understandably confusing. Thankfully, Lady Cinnabar
of Taneth has engaged in a couple of powerful discussions which give greater
sense to the concept. Before we read these, however, let us note something:
Aldmeris, the place of origin of the elves on Nirn, and the place from whence
mankind was driven, is said to not have existed. It is described as a state of
society, a state of existence even. Consider the chaos of the Gods walking on
the earth spouting off multiple realities. Could this state of being – mutiple
realities coexisting, with beings that simultaneously exist in these multiple
realities – be what is called Aldmeris?

Although Lady Cinnabar is speculating about Cyrodiil’s climate, she espouses a
view of Tower Lore that is extremely interesting. According to her
understanding, towers generate their own realities. If the Dawn was so chaotic,
could these towers have created habitable bubbles of tangibility in which the
mortal elves could survive?

>
> _[The Annotated Anuad][7]_{:tag="cite"}

Again, evidence of elves creating pockets of reality out in a realm of variable
chaos.

So, these towers, starting with Ada-Mantia resonate a song through the Earth
Bones, dictating reality and tangibility. The Aldmeri are described as
“self-refracting”. This implies that _multi-form elves began building towers or
using towers to select desired singular forms_.

This text also discusses “fold-places”. This undoubtedly refers to the provinces
of Tamriel. Although it might only mean that each province’s reality is
influenced by their towers, there is a strong implication that the provinces
represent _separate realities_. This is admittedly in the realm of speculation.
However, it’s semantical in the end.

Does one traverse reality by physically crossing a mountain range, or does one
have to use fold-magic to enter a new province? If the latter is true, it
implies that the separate realities were forced together into one reality at
some point. Perhaps this relates to the Eternal Champion and the Staff of Chaos?
Perhaps not. Regardless, Annotated Anuad has this to say:

> The wandering Ehlnofey expected to be welcomed into the peaceful realm, but
> the Old Ehlnofey looked on them as degenerates, fallen from their former
> glory. For whatever reason, war broke out, and raged across the whole of Nirn.
> The Old Ehlnofey retained their ancient power and knowledge, but the Wanderers
> were more numerous, and toughened by their long struggle to survive on Nirn.
> This war reshaped the face of Nirn, sinking much of the land beneath new
> oceans, and leaving the lands as we know them (Tamriel, Akavir, Atmora, and
> Yokuda). The Old Ehlnofey realm, although ruined, became Tamriel.

Whatever the point of convergence, the variable realities of Mundus were – in
war – shaped then united to become Tamriel. The towers define each province and
would be focal points of struggle, whether we consider White-Gold and Alessia or
the Battle of Red Mountain and Numidium.

_Here we see that reality on Nirn began as variable and multi-fold only to later
converge into a tangible, singular timeline._

Because this process had to occur once over time, it undoubtedly could reoccur.
**Multiple realities converging and diverging.** To understand the nature of
mythic power in Tamriel, one must understand this phenomenon. It is so
fundamental to Mundus that it requires the explicit existence of the Jills to
repair history when these “breaks” occur. We’ll discuss dragon breaks more in
Part IV.

Let us now examine the what the nature of life might have been before mortality.
Take an average elf-form follower of Auriel. This “prototype” Ehlnofey, or
Aldmer, might not have had a specific single form like a mortal. Instead, it
might be multifaceted, but along a gradient. So, in one “higher” kalpa this
being might appear as a prismatic dragon. In the “lower” kalpa it is a prismatic
elf. It has many faces, depending on which angle you view it from, but they
share a similar “race-form”.

It would not be surprising if many of the Aldmeri ancestors that are reckoned by
the Altmer are merely these multifaceted being which never were lone mortals,
but rather in one vessel contained the entirety of that family tree which would
later follow. Only further into the Dawn Era of Nirn would these beings begin
expressing their other forms in the bodies of their children, rather than them
being possessed directly in their bodies. Let’s consider the nature of these
multi-fold beings.

Altmeri creation myth discusses the children of the mixed blood of Anu and
Padomay. To a pure Anuaic or Daedric being Aetherius or Oblivion would be
ordinary realms consistent with their temperment. Aetherial magic is said to
induce change. Oblivion seems to be the realm of the dead – the static. And yet,
Anu is the agent of stasis, Padomay of change. How can this be?

Simple. To mixed beings, stasis represents potential. These beings are
prismatic, they have multiple forms. Stasis forces the forms to resolve into one
thing or another. This represents an act of becoming, which to a being in the
middle would appear as change.

Change, on the other hand, forces a prismatic form to become more and more
diverse more quickly. This represents a dissolution of form, an expunging of
stasis, and therefore an embrace of the void: death.

Change causes a mixed being to focus on stasis, to be desperate for it. Stasis
forces a mixed being to focus on change, for it is what is noticed. It is not
the nature of Aetherius that causes change in the mixed being, it is the nature
of the mixed being itself.

Not all gradients would be pure splits, many would intermingle. The tangled web
of relationships between gradients high and low creates a multitude of diverse
beings with harmonious or disharmonious interests. Indeed, the Warrior and Thief
are natural adversaries, and their struggle is the impulse which propels time
along its course.

These mixed blood beings cannot survive time nor Alduin’s fury. During the
Kalpic cycle, they travel to Aetherius for safety. This can only be survived if
one’s form is not dependent on singularity. Aetherius will expose the final
outcome of a being, freezing it in stasis. Only prismatic beings, revealed in
Aetherius to possess all possibilities of their form, can survive this light.
For mortals, one assumes that only the soul – that essence of potential – can
survive.

At Ada-Mantia, reality proceeded from the divines, who are said to have provided
tangibility to the world. These prismatic beings were capable of existing in
multiple forms, in multiple realities at once. Weaker spirits who were less
essential, less mythic, more specific, required the eyesight of the divines to
regard them in one or any subset of realities at once. That is, if a being
doesn’t know which reality to reside within, it will simply dissolve. The
divines were able to say “You! You exist with me in these 10 realities”.

Nirn failed as a project. Why? Because “too much skin was balled up”. Recall
that the skin metaphor of Yokudan myth begins by saying that the scales of Satak
were at first indistinguishable. This is the light of stasis tickling the
unknowable void-form of change. The product of this union are like sparkles or
glimmering glints of tangibility. Like the myth says, only after many cycles of
this did broad differentiated patterns emerge, and these became the divines.
Nirn represents the conclusion of this process, many unknowable Kalpas later.

If Anu is the dreamer, and if his waking would destroy the world by plunging it
into stasis which would last for an infinitesimal moment before being consumed
by nothingness, then Nirn’s creation represents too much tangibility at once.
It’s a risk of Anu seeing too much of the unknown. Too many competing and common
realities for anything that’s not broad and pure and essential enough to
survive. At once a vanilla yet purely chaotic outcome.

To save this world, the higher beings had to sacrifice themselves. What was this
sacrifice? They began to tell specific stories. As prismatic pure essences,
their stories were infinite. Imagine a father, master storyteller, reading to
his child. Imagine she’s dying. He has so many worlds in his mind, and yet if he
stops the current story she might slip away forever, and then who would hear it?
Thus, he keeps the current story going, limiting himself. This is the death of
the divines. An intentional self-limitation so that enough tangibility could
exist in which mortal kind could persist. It is the willful choice to tell only
one story.

One of the more notable examples of this is in Y’ffre. He is known as the
Storyteller.

> Y’ffre (God of the Forest): Most important deity of the Bosmeri pantheon.
> While Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere

> (the Wild Hunt).
>
> _[Varieties of Faith in the Empire][9]_

Here again is a clear distinction between chaos times and present tangibility.
The Wild Hunt reflects these times, hearkening to them. In the Wild Hunt, the
very forms of the Bosmer change, and they become all manner of beasts. A similar
phenomenon is described in the Khajiiti creation myth, and appears to have
affected man, beast, elf, and even plant. It is the telling of a singular story
by this God (or a singular set of common stories) that pushes away the chaos.

This phenomenon isn’t just a matter of divine power, but the careful balance
between reality and chaos is part of everyday life. This is revealed in the
nature of the Bosmeri Spinners.

According to the events of Elder Scrolls Online, the Spinners can be magically
manipulated into telling different stories about the future, and this actually
changes the future. The Spinners don’t merely know the future, their story
affects it.

If the power of the forest, through Y’ffre, gives the Bosmer this power over
reality, imagine what the Ayleids, Altmer, Dwemer, et al. could accomplish with
their towers. It begins to become clear what they were trying to accomplish.

Going back to Ada-Mantia, we think of it as Auriel’s space ship (due to
Nu-Hatta’s words). Michael Kirkbride had this to say about it:

> Start here: “A recent archaelogical study [of Direnni Tower], using the latest

> back to around ME2500, making it by far the oldest known structure in Tamriel.
> Although it has been much modified and added on to over the years, its core is
> a smooth cylinder of shining metal; the Tower is believed to extend at least
> as far beneath the surface as is now visible above, although its deepest
> bowels have never been systematically explored.” Sounds like a scroll case. A

If Ada-Mantia was Auri-El’s means of travel between Kalpas, in and out of
Mundus, whose scroll would it be?

Xarxes, the scribe of the gods, might just have played a role in constructing or
maintaining a vessel that is in essence a giant Elder Scroll. Think about it.

Ada-Mantia was portable tangibility, capable of preserving its form in and out
of Aetherius. It was the first tower, capable of imprinting reality and
tangibility upon the Earth Bone nodes of Nirn. How would it do this? _The same
way the gods have always done it_

**_By telling a story_**.

In Shor Son of Shor, the “other chieftans” defeat Shor’s host by use of
mirror-tricks. The vessel of Auri-El is made of stories, might not also his
armor be made of stories. Might a complex and powerful mythic narrative form the
basis of Divine concretization?

The Mundus is described as a song, the Elder Scrolls its sheet music. Y’ffre’s
storytelling is described as song.

There’s a concept that describes this craft of using sound to create. It’s
called _tonal architecture_. This is the use of the world-song to create
specific tangible outcomes systematically.

Thus, Xarxes the scribe is also Zen the craftsman. Xarxes the keeper of records
would also be the crafter of armor, the shield-thane to Auri-El.

Who then is Trinimac? If Xarxes is the Aurielic Tsun, where in history did the
name Trinimac take hold?

It is in Part IV that we answer this question. Finally, the relationship between
“To’Xarkay” and “Trinimalacath” is reconciled, the mystery of Orkey revealed.
Cast aside is idle speculation about tonal architecture. Instead, we will
examine the story of Red Mountain, and consider the true meaning of the tale of
Trinimac and Boethiah’s confrontation.

We will answer why the Dwemer and Orcs, in the shared orbit of the Velothi
mountains, each possess such a deep connection to the Red Moment, and are both
so troubled by Boethiah. (hint, it’s because the latter were created out of the
former)
