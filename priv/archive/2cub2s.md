As everyone knows, the theory that Orcs are transformed Dwarves is very
controversial.

After first debating it a few months ago, I’ve finally written a definitive
review of the lore and theory behind the argument. I’ve realized that unless you
spent a long time reading each part on each day I released them, you really
probably didn’t catch the whole theory.

Just to make it easier for everyone, I’ve decided to create this post as a
summary of the argument, so that you don’t really have to read the other parts
if you don’t want to. Also, I’ve developed my own understanding of this theory
which has evolved since I first proposed it. This represents the whole argument
in its most concise, considered form. This should be my last post on this
subject alone.

Here is my short version:

1. The Gods and Spirits existed as “multi-fold” beings. This means that each
   being inhabited multiple realities, as multiple forms, at once.

2. When Nirn was created, it’s landscape shared this “multi-fold” nature, where
   multiple realities inhabited the same lands at the same time.

3. This was Aldmeris; Ada-Mantia was its natural beginning, Snow-Throat its
   natural middle, and Red Mountain its natural ending.

4. At some point, perhaps as the result of many events, the realities of Nirn
   were consolidated into one timeline. The provinces of Tamriel are the
   remnants of former realities.

5. Some elves built towers to create realities artificially, copying Ada-Mantia.
   The Bosmer and Y’ffre used nature, the Green Pact, and Green-Sap to form
   their reality. The Altmer built Crystal-Like-Law and the idyllic Summerset
   Isles were the result. The Chimer sought the Heart of Lorkhan at Red
   Mountain. The Ayleids built White-Gold. The Khajiit had the Lunar Lattice.
   The Hist with the Argonians had a Mnemic Egg.

6. The Aldmeri were Prismatic Elves. They existed as multiple forms at once,
   having that “multi-fold” nature. This existence grew more and more difficult
   for spirits as they grew lesser and lesser in their mortality. This is why
   they built or otherwise relied on towers. In one sense, the Aldmeri are
   nothing more than the eternal spiritual beings that followed Auri-El since
   the beginning of time.

7. Each Elf race is a product of the tower influence refracting a single form
   out of the multi-form Aldmeri. The Altmer claim that they alone escaped
   Aldmeris, and that other elves are descended from them, migrating to the
   various corners of Tamriel from the Summerset Isles. This is probably
   propaganda, since historical knowledge is pretty scarce. The one source which
   documents the Altmer origin theory is Before the Ages of Man, written by a
   guy from the second era Aldmeri Dominion who literally is titled “Sapiarch of
   Indoctrination”. Probably, only the Altmer originated on Summerset. Everyone
   else refracted out of Aldmeris by the magic of towers.

8. Xarxes, a little-understood god, was called a scribe. It says he began as a
   scribe. I have theorized that because the gods are made of stories, that the
   art of keeping and writing narratives is equivalent to crafting material
   things from a mythic point of view. I assume that Xarxes might be a scribe
   and craftsman. One way of looking at this is taking the God Xen/Zen
   (Tsun/Zenithar), and combining him with Arkay. Xen’Arkay becomes Xarxes. It
   is later that the two aspects are separated.

9. I am assuming, only to fit with future events, that the “Orc” that bothered
   the Nords to their East in the Velothi Mountains are the People of Xarxes.
   People of Xarxes = Xarxians = Zorks = Orcs. This is substantiated by the
   confusion of Orkey, the Nordic adversary god. Orkey is either Arkay, or
   Malacath, and the lore specifically states that we’re not sure which.
   Arkay/Xarxes/Tuwhacca are associated in the lore. Trinimac/Malacath are as
   well. In Orkey stories, we read Orc and assume Malacath. For now, I’m
   assuming a race of scholar/craftsmen that traditionally vex the Nords from
   the East.

10. One scholar/craftsman race that has trouble the Nords from the East is the
    Dwemer. They are stated to be from the Velothi Mountains. Only later did
    some of them migrate to Vvardenfell and found freehold cities involved with
    the Heart of Lorkhan. This Velothi Mountain culture is who I’m calling the
    “Orcs” from the stories that mention Orkey. They look very much like Dwarves
    however – they are still the Children of Xarxes. Note, I’m not saying they
    worship him, only that they are racially his mythic reflection (hence, his
    children, reflecting his ideology and nature).

11. The Chimer started out as advanced Daedra worshippers, whose society
    declined. It became primitive Ashlander tribes, until in the South the great
    houses built a culture which nevertheless didn’t equal the old “High Velothi
    Culture”.

12. Red Mountain represents what is supposed to be the end of the Kalpa. The
    Nords invading it represent the resurgent armies of men fighting to reclaim
    Lorkhan’s heart prior to the final battle. During the final battle, Alduin
    will appear to defeat Lorkhan, Lorkhan will remove his heart, and a new
    Kalpa will commence. This final battle is also the first battle of the new
    cycle. Or rather, this is what is _supposed_ to happen. The Songs of
    Wulfharth reflect this.

13. Whereas the Ayleids are Aldmeri who built White-Gold to become Ayleids, the
    Dwemer and the Chimer are Aldmeri who came to be because of the power of
    Lorkhan’s Heart. The Chimer sought the Padomaic power of the Heart, the
    Dwemer pursued it out of scholarly interest and an obsession with the
    secrets of the world.

14. Like the Altmer, these Mer would have simply considered themselves Aldmeri.
    To the Dwemer, the Chimer were simply heretics, rather than a distinct race.
    The two of them self-refracted to the end of time together.

15. One myth about Arkay references an allegory of a shop-keeper obsessed with
    the secrets of the universe. This obsession cost him his life, but he trades
    his mortality in for the responsibility of overseeing life and death. I
    believe this is the story of Xarxes, or rather his children, and represents
    their complete arc. For now, one can imagine the Velothi Mountain Dwarves as
    similar to this shopkeeper: completely obsessed with deep knowledge. One of
    the few things we know of Xarxes is that he was also obsessed with
    knowledge, in his keeping of records, and that his wife was Oghma. The Oghma
    Infinium is Hermaeus Mora’s tome of incredible knowledge. I’m not suggesting
    Hermaeus Mora was necessarily involved with the Dwarves (he obviously was
    with some of them). I’m suggesting that the narrative of the pursuit of
    forbidden knowledge ties the Dwemer to this story about Arkay.

16. The Freehold Dwemer of Vvardenfell discovered Lorkhan’s Heart, and Kagrenac
    a master tonal architect developed three tools to manipulate its power.
    Their society debated what to do, some favoring using the heart, and others
    opposing it.

17. The Dunmer claim that the Dwemer had used the Heart of Lorkhan to gain
    immortality and god-like power. This is before Numdium and before their
    defeat. I suggest that by using the Heart of Lorkhan, the participating
    Dwemer achieved a collective Godhood – just like the Tribunal later did.
    This God, which was the Dwemer collectively, is what Trinimac is. Trinimac
    means son of three, and could refer to the three tools of Kagrenac.

18. The Secret Song of Wulfharth says Lorkhan reclaimed his heart, but Dumac,
    Nerevar, and Alandro Sul used Kagrenac’s tools to remove it from him. In
    Shor Son of Shor, it is always Shor who removes his own heart using
    Kagrenac’s tools (or something like them) and sends it into the next Kalpa.
    In Nirn’s creation, it is Trinimac who removes Shor’s heart by arcane magic.
    I’m suggesting that the God-Soul of the Dwemer is responsible for defeating
    Shor at the end of time at Red Mountain, after Shor defeated Alduin/Auri-El
    in the spirit plane. The story of Trinimac appears at the _beginning_ of
    Nirn, however. I’m proposing that the act of defeating Shor at Red Mountain
    started a _reverse_ of the Kalpic cycle. That Trinimac(The Dwemer God-Soul)
    now marches back in time undoing the Kalpas. Trinimac of the future gives
    the Heart to Auri-El of the past, each time.

19. Trinimac (People of Xarxes made divine) has an ideology of order and logic.
    He believes everything should have its proper place, and that cycles and
    motions should follow proper and predictable patterns. This matches the love
    of logic shared by the Dwarves, and is a harmony between narrative and
    craftsmanship (Xen/Arkay). It is natural that the Dwemer (like the Altmer
    and Ayleids really) would seek a return to the Aetherial past of the
    Aldmeri. The reverse of the Kalpas is fitting with their Elf nature. It is
    also fitting that some of them would want to take this ideology to its
    extreme with Numidium.

20. Not all the Dwemer knew of Numidium. Nerevar found out from Azura, and
    confronted his friend Dumac about it. Dumac was offended. Dumac did _not_
    know about Numidium and thought that Nerevar was referring to the Dwemer’s
    general use of the Heart and its power. This suggests three distinct
    factions of Dwemer. First, those against using the Heart of Lorkhan in the
    first place due to the risks involved. These are the tradition People of
    Xarxes, the Orcs. Next, those who used the Heart to attain a collective
    divinity as Trinimac. Finally, those aligned with Kagrenac whose ambitions
    were even greater than what they considered to be the inadequate and
    offensively false goal of a return to Aetherius.

21. The Chimer themselves represent yet another faction, in reality, since all
    were of Aldmeris. These sought enlightenment by Daedra worship.

22. Prior to the formation of the First Council, the Dwemer – Trinimac – sought
    to punish the heretical Chimer for following the teachings of Veloth –
    Boethiah. They might have succeeded, but the First Empire of the Nords
    intervened, and Nerevar joined with Dumac. Trinimac became “House Dwemer” of
    the First Council of the Boethian Chimer. Nerevar is known to have had a
    magic ring that could convince people to follow him. Where once Trinimac
    might have punished Boethiah, Boethiah has now “eaten” Trinimac. At Red
    Mountain, Dumac fights alongside Nerevar, “son of Boethiah”.

23. Dumac was betrayed by Kagrenac, who kept secrets from him. He was betrayed
    by Dagoth and the Tribunal who would have the Nords overrun the Dwemer
    before coming to their aid. And, presumably, he was betrayed by Nerevar who
    would see the Dwemer destroyed rather than allow the completion of Numidium.
    It’s very likely that those who wanted to participate in the Numidium
    project had already joined with it, and this is the first betrayal of Dumac.
    This act likely greatly weakened the Dwemer lines, since many would
    disappear.

24. One account of Red Mountain says that Nerevar and Dagoth used the tools on
    the Heart to separate the Dwemer from their divine power after Dumac had
    fallen (presumably in the battle with Shor and Wulfharth). This is the
    second betrayal of Dumac. One account says that after Trinimac’s betrayal,
    Boethiah cast a ritual to scar and twist his appearance and send him to a
    plane of choking air and ash.

25. The Anticipations says that the followers of Boethiah and Trinimac rubbed
    the soil of Trinimac upon them to change their skins. We know for a fact
    that the Dunmer had a change of skin during Red Mountain. It appears that
    the Orsimer were created out of the same event as the Dunmer according to
    this text.

26. In two texts, Dumac is called “Dumalacath Dwarf-Orc”.

27. The Battle of Red Mountain is associated with something called the Year of
    “Sun’s Death” or the “Year of Winter in Summer”. This is associated with
    Mauloch, saying Mauloch’s rage caused this event in Varities of Faith.

28. In his burning pit of ash (Dumac’s mortally wounded, discarded, betrayed,
    formerly part divine body left for dead in the eruption of the mountain),
    Mauloch cuts the shame out of his heart, and emerges reborn as Malacath.
    Trinimac’s most devoted followers change their skin too.

29. Going back to Arkay, perhaps the shame of Dumac was the pride of his people
    and their unhealthy obsession with secret knowledge. This obsession led to
    Numidium, which divided the Dwemer and anti-created a great number of them.
    So “Xarxes” cut out his shame, “Arkay”. He was left with “Xen”.

30. It is very very well established that while Malacath is a Daedric Lord
    (though not accounted as such by other Daedra, befitting his realm), Mauloch
    might also have an Aedric aspect. That is, Mauloch is the Orsimer version of
    Zenithar. The Bosmer and Orsimer share a ritual site to Xen/Mauloch
    (craftsman’s god) in Valenwood. Both Dwemer and Orsimer are master craftsmen
    in their own way. The Dwemer were also incredible scholars, and at one point
    powerful and partly divine. The worship of Mauloch as a god is something
    that occurs after the transformation, since Dwemer didn’t worship Gods, but
    became divine and lived according to logic and science.

31. The Dwemer devoted to Dumac (Trinimac’s most devoted followers) became
    Orsimer with him, and Dumac specifically is Mauloch God-King. This is
    slightly different than Malacath who is equated with the Oblivion realm of
    the betrayed, though Dumalacath earned a proper mantling of this realm. The
    Dwemer not devoted to Dumac were convinced by Kagrenac’s plan involving
    Numidium. Any Dwarves not devoted to Dumac, who thence became Orsimer,
    disappeared to become the skin of Numidium. This disappearance obviously
    greatly weakened the Dwemer during their seminal moment during the Battle of
    Red Mountain, and counts as a mighty betrayal of Trinimac/Dumac.

That’s the theory. Whether the “Orcs” of history prior to Red Mountain looked
like Dwarves, or whether Mauloch’s birth represented a dragon break which
retroactively remade the souls that didn’t join up with Numidium into
green-skinned Orsimer – well, we don’t know.

But, you can read the longer parts of the theory for a comprehensive discussion
and lore sources.

Thanks everyone!

ADDED TOPICS DUE TO DISCUSSION:

/u/tak-in-the-box mentioned Volendrung

True, Malacath’s possession of Volendrung is hardly proof of anything. But if
the Dwarf-Orc theory is true, imagine this: after his betrayal Dumalacath
gathers what remains of his transformed people and they flee the Dunmer to the
West. They are beset upon by Nords the whole time. They make it to Saarthal, in
the unforgiving northern wastes (according to Varieties of Faith: Mauloch). The
Year of Sun’s Death rages on. The Nords continue to harass their old enemies,
who are now desolate. The Orsimer’s Vvardenfell colonies are destroyed or
overrun, the Nords drive them out of the Velothi Mountains. So, they appear to
go to Saarthal, but in reality are seeking Blackreach. They no longer possess
their brilliance, and can’t access the all the old holds under the ice and rock,
nor defeat the hordes of Falmer recently liberated from their oppressors. They
have to fight, to make tools and armor of unmatched quality from improvised
materials. The Orsimer begin a long painful trek to the West, in order to escape
the Nords once and for all. They eventually make it to Volenfell. Mauloch was
hoping to reunite with the Rourken clan, figuring these potential allies surely
must have survived the tragic events of Red Mountain. They arrive to find empty
halls, unaware that any Dwarves not among them as Orcs were anti-created to
summon Numidium. Mauloch sits upon the Rourken throne, taken Volendrung in his
hands, and declares Volenfell and the halls of Rourken to be their new home.
Tragically, or fittingly, the Ra Gada arrives shortly thereafter to make this
people pariahs once again.

Next topic: Vvardenfell

Again, not proof of anything, but interesting: Vvardenfell = city of the strong
shield. Trinimac = the strong knight. Could the Dwemer freeholds have been
initially established to defend Red Mountain against Shor’s Ghost? To build a
defense to prevent Lorkhan from reclaiming his heart? Really would frame
everything else quite nicely.
