It was the last night of King Olaf’s burning in Solitude and merriment filled
the air. As was customary, all the little Nord boys and girls went around
collecting money for the burning that was to take place later that evening.

One such boy, through bad luck and misdirection, wound up in one of the darker
parts of Solitude. He found before him a door that appeared to be unopened for
some time now. After a few seconds’ hesitation, he knocked on it.

A man opened the door - but what a man he was! Clad in strange blue robes and
holding a strange staff, he was the most outlandish man the boy had ever seen.
His beard and his wrinkles spoke of someone very, very old, but why had the
elders never mentioned him if he was such?

“Septims for King Olaf?” the boy said, equal parts eagerness and fear in his
eyes.

“Ah, the Burning? Why, we haven’t had one of those in a long time.” The man
looked down on the little boy with a sneer.

The boy cocked his head. “Will you or won’t you?”

The man smiled. “Do you know who you’re talking to? If you did, you wouldn’t
take that tone with me…”

The boy stopped in thought for a while.

“You’re…a wizard, right?”

The man smiled. “Very good.”

“Then how comes you don’t go outside like all the others?”

The wizard crouched down, down, until his eyes met the boy’s. “Do you know the
story of the First Wizard?”

The very first wizard worked for the very first king, who was far stronger than
any King or Emperor alive today. Under their joint rule, the kingdom became
known everywhere as the best and greatest kingdom to ever exist.

And the king’s people lived good lives. And the kingdom prospered and grew, and
all was well.

One day, the king told the wizard that he wanted to build a city that was
greater than any city before it. He wanted to show the world how wondrous his
kingdom was. And being his friend, he entrusted the details of its creation and
construction to the wizard.

The wizard was starstruck. He vowed on his name that he would design the best
and greatest city the world had ever known, and a wizard never breaks his vows.
Quickly, he set off to work on what he called The Silver City.

Workers came from far and near, all eager to labor for this creation the king
and the wizard had devised. They wanted a share in this “Silver City” of many
wonders.

Many days and many nights they worked, and every one of them was tired at the
end of it. They all worked their hardest, because in each of their hearts was
the secret desire that they would be chosen to lead this marvelous city.

At last, the sun dawned on the day of the city’s completion! Despite the
raggedness of their muscles, the workers all pulled themselves to the city’s
grand opening. The wizard was not there with the king to present it, but was
hidden in the crowd, eager to hear their reactions to what he had created.

The king’s voice was raised in elation as he started to declare who he had
chosen to govern this fair city. “The lord of this fair city,” he said, “shall
be none other than myself. I shall rule over the city and this capital, and
shall bear all the joys and sorrows inherent within both my stations.” The
wizard was overjoyed. He couldn’t wait to hear the praises they would heap upon
the king!

What the wizard did hear instead mortified him.

“Why should we content ourselves with this misery,” they said, “when he has the
kingdom entire? Why should we let him have this Silver City? The king has not
known a day of labor, but we have worn ourselves ragged to the bone for this!”

A yell and before the wizard could blink, the laborers were all rushing towards
the king.

The king flopped helplessly against the current of angry arms and voices raised
against him. The workers were furious. One rushed towards the king and, digging
his fingers into his chest, tore out his heart.

The first wizard’s face grew dark. Taking his staff and his robe and his books
and all his other wonders with him, he stormed off to the highest corner of the
city. There he swore another vow on his name, his second and last one. Never
again would he share his visions with the vulgar crowd. He would go on to design
wonders that would outshine even the Silver City, but all aside from him would
never lay their eyes on them, for their small minds and shriveled hearts were
unworthy of his works. And in that moment he set the example for all wizards who
would follow him.

“So the First Wizard swore to never know company ever again?”

“That’s right.”

“But doesn’t that make him lonely? All that power and no-one to share it with?”

A long silence followed.

The wizard’s expression was unreadable. “Go away, child.”

“But-”

“I said GO AWAY.” The wizard beat his staff on the ground. A small shock pulsed
through the air, resounding through the empty streets and knocking the child on
his feet.

The child glimpsed one last time at the wizard. His face was darkened with
anger. Momentarily, the child wondered; was that the same face the First Wizard
wore when he made his second oath? And was that confusion he saw in his eyes
too? His head spinning, the boy picked himself up and ran away.

Later that night, the wizard found that he could not sleep.
