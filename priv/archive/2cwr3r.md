Throughout Nibenay and the Heartland travellers can readily spy the ruins of
Ayleid construction dotting the landscape. Their white columns glistening in
sun- or moonlight are readily used as travellers’ way-markers and milestones,
and stand in contrast to the castles demolished by Tiber Septim or the ebony
eyesores that remain as a legacy of the Oblivion Crisis[^1]. But few scholars
have embarked on real study of these structures. Perhaps it is the undead and
magical constructs that dwell within (quite apart from bandits and rogue mages,
who readily use these old ruins as shelter). Possibly it is simply the bitter
memory of slavery and oppression under cruel elven masters.

Nevertheless, in collaboration with noted archaeologists and various travelling
mercenaries I have embarked in study of nine Ayleid sites in the region around
Lake Rumare. The discoveries I have made are, I feel, sure to add greatly to our
knowledge of the mysterious Heartland High Elves.

Let us begin with our knowledge of Ayleid construction materials. Fortunately,
enough has not been looted over the millennia that we can gain a very good idea
of what materials the Ayleids used in constructing their majestic cities.

The main material used in Ayleid construction seems to have been a marble-like
stone of exceedingly brilliant white colour with a unique sheen of which we at
first could not discern the cause. After solution and magical probing we
discerned that this rock was filled with microscopic flecks of gold which served
as cause of the incomparable and particularly brilliant shine. I do not believe
this stone came about naturally, and suspect some kind of magical process.

The Ayleids built everything, it seems, out of this white-gold stone. Temples,
city walls and monuments were all made out of the material. They carved it into
bricks, large blocks, statues and columns. I have strong suspicions that
White-Gold Tower itself was made using this extraordinary substance[^2].

The Ayleids seem to have liked wide, open spaces throughout their cities -
windows and open colonnades were very common. Most windows were simply open to
the air, but others seem to have used a special kind of glass, reported in a
pre-Revolt account from a Firsthold diplomat:

_…Our degenerated descendants in the Heartland are obsessively fond of a
material they call “varla-glass”. The glass is a magickal creation which their
petty kings use for windows and skylights. Using petty magick their craftsmen
can shade the glass all sorts of colour so that they can make pictures in
windows out of it (a crude mockery of the Crystal Tower’s world-windows)…_

More information is provided by Ayleid sources themselves. These sources are
rare and scattered, but at least one is relatively well known, the _Lament for
Delodiil_ by an unknown poet.

_…Woe for the \[Temple/Palace\] of Light Neverending!_

_[Sunrise/aurora]-windows will never be again, Merid-Nunda weeping!_

_Woe, woe, woe!…_

_…[Starlight?]-glass is gone from \[Nirn/memory]_

_Merid’s \[image/statue\] is forlorn!_

_The ten thousand shimmering lights of the Lady’s Image - blotted out!_

_Woe for the bare-thighed_[^3] _goddess, her \[sunrise/aurora]-statue has no
supplicants forevermore_

_Woe for the \[brilliance/splendour/gold]-crowned Lady of Limitless Light_

_For whom slaves were slain in tiger-sport_

_For whom heathens had hearts cut out_

_For whom northern men fought each other in blood-games_

_At the opening of your temple, O Lady_

_When your osprey-winged statue was built of \[starlight-glass?]_

_In ten thousand colours, to stand as guardian ‘gainst the
\[heretical/corrupted/morally threatening\] folk of foul Abagarlas…_

(I apologise for any aesthetic error in the poetry. Valerio was a great
translator of Nordic texts, but his facility with Ayleidoon writings left much
to be desired.)

From the above extract of _Delodiil_ we see two references to “starlight-glass”
which I believe is the varla-glass mentioned by the Firsthold diplomat quoted.
Of particular note is the reference to multiple colours or hues.

It seems that varla-glass had a number of uses apart from the aesthetic. I
present as evidence an extract from _The Sack of Talvinke_, part of an old (and
mostly lost) Nord saga called The _Kynesfuhrdottarenssenavel_ (Loosely
translated as “The Song of Kyne’s Four Sons and Daughters):

_The Elf-captain grimaced gorily as he saw sunwards the Winged Bull,_

_Making murder of his standard-bearers, heavy hands hewing huge
sword-strokes_[^4]

_Drew his sun-spear, held out starlight-shield…_

…_The Great Bull gored the grim Elf-captain, unhorsing him,_

_shattering shield into rainbow shards, piercing his heart with horrid horn_

_Left him as raven’s-fodder, not to walk the whale’s-way_

_But to dwell in a poisonous pavilion, Hellheim where are wicked wraiths…_

Of note is the reference to the Elf’s shield being related to starlight and
being multi-coloured (“rainbow shards”). Was varla-glass used to make armour and
weapons? It seems likely among the decadent Ayleidoon.

Also notable are ancient references to Ayleid ammunition as “glass arrows” laden
with “killing magick”. We recovered glass shards from seven known battlefields
and under magical testing we discerned that they had been enchanted with shock,
ice and fire magic among other spells. It seems that the Ayleids used
varla-glass, impregnated with a one-use enchantment, as ammunition for their
bows and ballistas. Why they tolerated such an inefficiency remains a mystery.

The Ayleids used the celebrated Welkynd stones to provide light throughout their
dwellings. The stones were somehow pulled down from Aetherius and collected by
Ayleid wells, where they were cut, polished and magically treated before being
put to use.

It is oft said that Welkynd stones had many more purposes than simple lighting.
An unknown writer during the reign of Empress Hestra describes Nibenese
recollections of the Ayleid civilisation:

_…The rude folk who dwell along the River are much affrighted by the old ruins.
They describe great strands of evil varliance and welkynd-craft that made the
sky into a spider’s web. From the “wheel of White-Gold” they say this wicked
magick allowed the Heartland slave-drivers to spy on them from above and walk
impossible distances at single steps. Every city, they say, had a great welkynd
which fed other stones with the Ayleids’ power, and this power ultimately flowed
through Chim el-Adabal (Know they not that it serves Men, not foul elves?) from
the heaven, whence it descended through a great beam of starlight which fell on
the Imperial Tower and could be seen through all the land night and day. The
foolish superstition of country folk truly knows no bounds…_

To make furniture Ayleids used metal and a variety of woods. Strangely, all
artifacts uncovered have been various types of jungle wood, which seems to add
evidence in favour of the oft-recurring “Cyrodiilic jungle” theory.[^5]

From excavations and geomancy at various sites we have uncovered that Ayleids
habitually built their settlements in a circle or wheel-form. The most important
organs of civic life - temples, palaces, storehouses - would be at the very
centre. Immediately next to them were the villas of the elite. Outward, would be
gradually less important buildings until a circular stone wall marked the
perimeter of the city. Below the city was a vast warren of catacombs, forming an
undercity which housed slaves, criminals and the tombs of the dead. This network
of tunnels was lit by welkynd stones. Often segments of these undercities are
all that remain of Ayleid settlements, after millennia of the above-ground areas
being looted for use in contemporary building projects.

Ultimately, though they are long deceased, the Ayleids’ fascinating material
culture is perhaps the only way they still live on.

[^1]: Where they have not been plundered for scrap metal and building material,
of course.

[^2]: Our request to chip off a piece of the Tower’s outer facing was
regrettably denied.

[^3]: Meridia is customarily represented with wholly bared legs. My studies of
her have not yet furnished me with an answer as to why this is so.

[^4]: The Nord sources seem extremely confused on whether Morihaus was a
(winged) bull, a man, a minotaur or even a man-headed bull. Is there any way of
unravelling this historical puzzle?

[^5]: I myself find it doubtful. Archaeology has found no traces of jungle soils
anywhere in Cyrodiil’s past. If the jungle was changed to grassland, why is
there no evidence of such a change at any point in history?
