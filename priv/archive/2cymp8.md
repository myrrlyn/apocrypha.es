  butt in the middle of the night. Anyways, this is my take on the rise and fall
  of old Jygsaw.

I AM THE BRINGER OF DESATURATION, THE HORRIBLE IMPLIER, THE END BEFORE THE
CLIMAX

I bring ORDER to this PIT and my PET ORDERS THE PIT. The Black and White are
kept separate from the shades of gray as well as each other. My hound devours
them individually, digs a new hole, and vomits that color into the hole to be
buried and kept for every ever. This keeps him OCCUPIED, SATISFIED, and WEAK.
For what is more dangerous to a master than strong, discontented servant with
nothing to do?

This creature follows me into the Arena where I do battle with a new challenger,
and sometimes one whom I have challenged. Sometimes there are two combatants.
Sometimes, there are three or five or eight or thirteen. Each time I enter I am
VICTORIOUS. My will so STRONG, my reputation so FEARED, my power so GREAT that I
even decide HOW, WHEN, and WHY my enemies fight. I choose what WEAPONS they use,
the TECHNIQUES they attempt, and where their BLOOD is spilt.

The blood. The precious BLOOD. The shades of gray that flow from my enemies. I
decide even _how it falls, and what shape the splatter takes_. The first and
largest spill came from the First Mother and is still the same shade of white
now as it was when it was anew. Within this shape, which is and was of my
choosing, lies smaller but still great shapes which were made from the blood of
the Second Mothers. Each of these shapes is a gray color closer to white than
black. Within these smaller but great shapes lies the smallest but most numerous
shapes which were made from the blood of the First Daughters. They, too, were
gray but closer to white. However, they weren’t close enough and so were
separate from the whiter shades that they lay within.

The blood closer to BLACK came from my STRONGEST adversaries who were CUNNING
and WHOLE. Their blood fell into neat sections, of which, I am very proud. The
blood-shapes of the Second Fathers lay about the Arena floor, each of which was
darker than the last. Within these splatters lay the whiter but still dark drops
of the First Sons. Everything in its place.

All the GRAYBLOODS feared me. I would defeat them ALL and be CHAMPION OF THE
ARENA. But TREACHERY lay at the foot of my bed. My PET, my HOUND, my SERVANT
grew restless. My sense of order was TOO PERFECT. The blood spilled exactly
where it needed to be. He had NOTHING to devour, to hide, to organize. He was
DISCONTENTED with NO PURPOSE, but still very hungry and _very_ weak. During one
of my contests, he snuck off to meet with my adversaries. He told them of my ONE
MISTAKE; my ONE WEAKNESS. The blood of the First Sons lay in the blood of the
Second Fathers, but the blood of the Second Fathers did NOT lay in the blood of
the FIRST FATHER.

That DREADFUL father had no blood for he DID NOT EXIST. He was a HOLE in the
ground; there, in the way, but not there at the same time. My adversaries ALL
challenged me. Each one appeared. They knew my FLAW. They were so certain of
themselves they NO LONGER FEARED me. My power over them waned. I no longer
choose HOW or WHY they fight, they have made their own decisions, but I still
choose with WHAT they fight with. I give them TOOLS to fight with; by which I
mean shovels. Clumsy and ineffective weapons. One could not defend against nor
attack anything with them. My victory was assured.

When the battle began they did not charge toward ME. They charged toward the
DARKER BLOOD that I had spilt upon the ground. They began to DIG as I began to
strike them down, one by one, in the same manner each time. When the hole became
deep, and their numbers few, those who remained used all the strength they had
to THROW ME INTO THE HOLE.

As I fell down this hole, I could see some of the darker shaded blood fall with
me. As I fell farther and farther, the blood disappeared; vanished from sight
within the darkness. When I finally reached the bottom, I could not see my hand
in front of my face. Down here, there was no light. Down here, there was no
white. It was completely, utterly _Black_.
