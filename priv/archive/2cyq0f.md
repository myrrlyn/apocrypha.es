To His Outcast Majesty, King Budgul Gro-Wrothgar,

I have received your letter of invitation, and have deliberated with other
chieftains of my people. You seem to be an honest and upright man and your goal
of sovereignty, self-reliance and independence is a noble one that my people
understand well, for we embody those qualities ourselves. We have admired – from
afar – the spirit and industrious nature of the Orsimer people. You are fine
warriors and peerless smiths, and as a warrior of no small renown myself I
concede the legendary deeds of Orc swordsmen and berserkers. Many of my brethren
feel the same as I in this regard, so let it never be said that my people have
no regard for Orcish steel or Orcish battle spirit.

Our objection to and ultimate rejection of the invitation to join the Betmeri
Pact stems from deep and profound spiritual differences between our races. The
Men of Tor come from a proud old tradition. We worship Kyne as our matron
goddess and our progenitor, and we’re afraid this piety before the Mother of
Storms would cause tension among you and your allies. We are aware of the Code
of Malacath. We realize how deeply and fundamentally important this Daedric
Prince is in the lives of not only Orcs, but your Goblin and Ogre allies. We
could never abandon Kyne in favor of a Daedra. That would be unspeakable to us.
Kyne mothered mighty Morihaus, who fathered us all. We are the true men of
Colovia and carry the blood of the Dragon. We channel Kyne’s breath through our
mighty horns, which gore our enemies.

When the Alessians harried the Colovian kingdoms and tried to force our
fair-skinned cousins of Kvatch and old Stuhngrad to join their Empire, we Men of
Tor resisted along with them. When the general Falchou was slain in Glenumbra
and the remainder of his forces made the mistake of trying to escape through
Chorrol, my ancestors were there. They gored through the retreating ranks and
made them pay dearly for their intrusion. Many of the pursuing Bretons stood in
awe of us, and abandoned their heathen worship of Z’en and Xarxes in favor of
mother Kyne. When our lord Reman called out for mighty teamsters to stand at his
side and help him unite the land, yea, we answered the call. Even his pet snakes
recognized our honor and battle prowess, and dared not harass or subjugate us.

Now, the land is descending into chaos. Reachmen run wild in the hills,
screaming and murdering, and the Tharns have replaced the Akaviri as overlords
of Nibenay, but in a way they are even more serpentine and cold-blooded than the
snake men. Those, at least, were honest about their nature. With the
Battlemages, the order of the day is duplicity, faithlessness and forgetfulness
of past alliances. And so the mighty men of the Sanctus Taurus find ourselves
outcast and hated in our own lands – demonized as brutes and savages in popular
fiction and folk belief. Perhaps it is because of this that you believe we’d
join your pact, out of desperation and self-preservation. I admire the tenacity
it took to ask us, but our answer to you shall remain negative for the
foreseeable future. Being branded friends of Daedric cultists would do us no
favors, I am afraid. There are still a few secluded groves where the mightiest
sons of Belharza still dwell. These holy places are guarded by spriggans and
unicorns. I am writing you from one such kingdom. As long as Kyne’s wards
remain, these places are safe. I appreciate your concern – truly – and hope for
the safety of your own people. Pray to whatever outcast gods you wish, but know
that Kyne was the first to cry for mortals.

Your neutral contact,

Mujitaba the Iron-Hoofed
