## Deadlands. New Palace of Destruction

Prince of Energy and Revolution bursted into the meltening halls of not-so-solid
fire. Changeability fluxed from the two of his hands and two more were too busy
tearing apart an unfortunate clanfear – routine activity in the lands of mighty
Razor. And yet, something was off. There was no signs of him regaining his
temper (for that _was_ his temper), when a thread was spun under the massive
cupola of the palace.

—What happened, O mighty Prince? What brought such foul curses on 5 and 8 and 15
corners?

Prince glanced up to see the the source of the voice.

—U wanna know? Then come down, spider, and I'll tell you.

Mehrunes placed himself on the throne with head reclined upon his hand while
woman was descending. She wrapped his spear of hate in her hands as black as the
eyes of Nocturnal and began to weave the pleasure-yarn. Silk threads of joy were
interconnecting into the patterns of delight, sex-web known only to the children
of Mephala.

—Will my Master tell me who dared to insult him?

At the next moment Dagon has grabbed her throat and said through teeth:

—Watch your words. Noone. Insults. Me!

He tried to see the fear in her eyes but there was none. This kin doesn’t know
fear. Wasn’t it the reason he agreed to their services at the first place? He
loosened his grip and answered weary.

—The sands are running out, plans are failing, I may actually lose. And I has
visited Molag Bal, my brother in fire. He plumed himself upon his plots, said he
could enslave the entire Arena in two years, said he is better than me. So we
made another wager: one of us should conquer Nirn in one year. To Void with such
a bids! How am I supposed to do this?

Spider ended her spinning and poured the sweet ichor in the Prince's ear:

—Don’t worry, Master. My mother-father from whose egg I emerged has a gift.
Chain of elegant murders for you to win. Will you accept it?

On the opposite side of Throne Hall there were two daedra guards – faydroth and
dremoroth – whispering one to another.

—You know, maybe seducers wasn’t really the bad choice?

## Cyrodiil. Kvatch. Panoxius manor. 1^st^ of Morning star

—And we were tripping balls for six hours…

—Did you see old Benirus? They say that looser has actually crashed here
together with his apprentice…

—No, you WILL help us! It is yours duty! Leyawin fell and anyone here can become
the next target! Don’t you see it?!

New Life night-party was in full spate. Cultists of Sanguine were filling and
re-filling goblets with the drinks, necromancers got rocks off after the never
budging in their magic chambers and bloodsuckers were as always busy making the
petty politics.

—Of course Cheydinhal will help you, – leered Indarys Sulen, enmity between
those two domains was the open secret.

—Yes, we are ready to dispatch the Fighters guild whenever you want, – caught up
the speech his companion and Sulen returned to peering into the window. Sounds
from the Kvatch Colisseum – it seemed Jiub was showing his battle prowess –
could meet the ear even in this suburban manor. Dunmer hated such an
arrangements as this party, but his presence here was the direct order from
Matriarch. Supposedly he had to control the magic activity of the rival
bloodlines and try to hear their hidden thoughts, but it was clearly impossible,
far too highly placed persons were attending the ball for anyone to violence the
propriety, and Matriarch knew this. Her intentions remained unknown; though some
say she has prophetical abilities…

—Silence and Attention! _Alatavilte_ shall speak!

—Thank you, my friend.

Eight hooded figures entered the main hall, accompanied with the Panoxius, pudgy
Imperial, with another Imperial man (bearing too heavy similarity with Kvatch
count) wrapped in the corpse-lovers robes and the woman ghost. One of the
figures stepped further.

—On this auspicious day we are happy to declare that Cyrodiil Vampyrum Order
from now is the eternal friend of the Black Worm Order and its master – divine
Mannimarco.

—On behalf of every Worm Supreme I'm eager to confirm the announcement of the
Firstborn and to bring the glorious news: King of Worms soon will condescent and
bring with him the new era! Rejoice!

—Now I demand the represantives of the _Arani_ to make their vows.

Assembly has sank into silence. Only the commotion of the blood-fountain was
breaching the quietness. Speachless Sulen stared at the Firstborn and he wasn’t
the only one in such a state. Then necromancers bursted with sreamings of joy,
but with the movement of hand the vampire muted them.

—Also Black Worms will help us defend ourself from the foreign invaders, – now
it was the necromancers’ turn to be astonished…

Sulen and Kaeso were walking down the city streets. Party was still on-going but
few people except of sanguinites actually remained. Panoxius was ready to give
the shelter for everyone who was in need, but Cheydinhal's spokesmen preferred
to depart to their hired house. They walked amongst the celebrates. In the
distance fireworks entertained the public, bards were singing vulgar songs on
the corners, the image of Akatosh stared blankly from the top of the church and
half-concious priest drank something beneath it. Kvatch. City of decadence.
Suddenly Dunmer stopped and started to look about.

—Flee from me Sheogorath, may your madness never take me,- said he and blessed
himself with the triangle sign.

—?

—I saw Emperor Uriel Septim right now, – was the answer. He was still trying to
find the one, who caught his eye.

—Hm, – Kaeso too began to look around him, – maybe Emperor actually decided to
spend the holydays here?

—No, another Septim. Fifth. I saw him once, when he hadn’t yet been crowned.

—Ha-ha, that’s really the joke of Madman. Let’s go, – several minutes they
walked in silence and then Kaeso asked, – say, why do you hate New Life
festivities so much?

—What do you mean by this?

—I mean last year you have openly sweared to present Vicente to Dagon if he
would once more congratulate you on it. Or is it a secret?

—_Place him in the Corner of Dagon_, – reflexively corrected him Sulen, – and
stuff his mouth with the garlic… He just finally pissed me off. Don’t you know
him? That smile of his…

—So it _is_ a secret?, – concluded Kaeso while looking at the frowned attendant.

—Not really. My wife returned to ash on this day.

—And you speak it so calm?!

—Why shouldn’t I? She now sails through the Oblivion and look over me. I have
talked to her after this many times.

—You Dunmers are weird.

—It’s you, who is weird. How long ago has your own wife died? How many
generations of your children you buried? Isn’t it strange for undead to care
about death? Let’s stop this discussion. We almost arrived. Where will we head
tomorrow?

—To Skingrad, with count’s legate.

## Valenwood. Floating leaves islands. Direnni summerhouse. 1^st^ of Morning Star

Bird's voice proclaimed:

—Serjo Telvanni Ralmiso Mora has arrived!

Dark elf… Spectre of dark elf… Lich? _Something_ has slowly floated inside the
richly decorated room and turned its head backward.

—Direnni are happy to greet sæla Ralmiso in our demesne! Let the light always
shine on you. How was your journey?, – words belonged to the Altmer entering the
room from the other side, – And yes, that was harpy. Imga have a lot of work on
their legs.

One named Ralmiso Mora turned his attention to the host and answered with a
creepy smile:

—Greetings, sera. Let no ash foul your garments but mine only…

—For when _you_ stride through the ash, _you_ become stronger, – laughed
Direnni. He has lived for many centuries and still was amused with the Dunmeri
proverbs. After pouring a beverage placed on the table into the silver goblet he
lively continued, – I see you haven’t yet restored teleportation spells?

—Same as you, – answered dark elf with a grin. His face was of a mummy,
exiccated skin pulled on the skull. He flied – his legs (or what was there
instead of legs?) weren’t touching the floor – closer to the collocutor, who has
sit down in the chair. They gazed fixedly one at another for some time.

—So you _were_ able to restore the Shadow Leap, – high elf was trying to read
emotions on the not-living face of his guest.

—Same as you, – answered the dark elf again and grinned even wider, baring his
unusually white teeth. They dreadfully contrasted with his almost black skin.

—Gwinas Bocylye has arrived!, – Bird announcement has interrupted this
“friendly” converstion and Altmer – his name was Thuvenathil Direnni – has rose
up to greet the new guest.

—Direnni are happy to greet sæla Gwinas in our demesne! Let the light always
shine on you. How was your journey?

Gwinas came out of wooden wall and totally ignored the ceremonial welcome. Prim
Direnni hated this behavior from the beginning of their acquaintanceship. The
Bosmers’ ability of walking through the wood was so offensive, it was the same
as saying, “look, I can assasinate you whenever I want”.

Wood elf adjusted his silk raiments, his exquisite bone comb and looked on the
party.

—So, everyone has gathered. Sera Ralmiso, how is our business? Are we ready?

—He-he. Yes, we are. Arranges have been made, – un-alive laugh, that came from
the Dunmer's mouth, could scare away a flock of cliff racers. He then reached
under his tattered brown clothes and pulled out the set of candles and the glass
phial with the strange blood-like substance inside; his companions took out the
same phials and also Gwinas picked up the flute and Thuvenathil placed the
parchment on the table.

—In this case, let us start, – and Bosmer began to extract sounds from the
instrument, the mesmerising melody of binding.

Dunmer has placed five candles on the corners of the parchment and started the
incantation:

—With the dreugh wax cursed by Enslavement…

—With the parchment blessed by Inevitability, – continued Thuvenathil. They now
were singing together.

—On the day of Oath with the music of Storyteller we mix our blood in the
bittercup and drink it together, – they poured the content of all three phials
down unto the parchment and it began to crawl, form sigils and fluctuate. Elfs
were performing the rite until the candles have completely burned down. Then the
parchment folded by itself many times, wrapped by the candle wax, and was sealed
by the Gwynas’ bone flute. Tired master of the house felt on the chair and began
to drink the wine (or what can you find in the Valenwood instead?) right from
the bottle and wood elf followed his example under the derisive gaze of the
floating Telvanni.

—AE CLAVICUS VILE ALTADOON!, – finished Ralmiso. – Now, let me take my leaving.
I have a long road to walk.
