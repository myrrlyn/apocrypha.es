  The Hist. It can be safely said that no one knows exactly what the fuck they
  are. They are probably the oldest beings in existence, both trans-kalpic and
  from outside the Dream. They are all-knowing, extremely powerful, and
  incredibly patient. They care about their privacy and their Argonians, and woe
  to those that interfere with their creations or their pass.

  The Ehlnofey are the proto-men and mer, the ancestors of all the races on Nirn
  except for the Saxhleel of Black Marsh.

  But the mystery ends today (I think). For I believe that I have – through
  intense studying and analyzing – discovered the true origins of both the Hist
  and the Ehlnofey on Nirn.

  They are the children of Anu the Everything. And this is their story.

The biggest pieces of evidence I’ll be using for this post comes from the
Annotated Anuad, a simple book that has appeared in Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim,
and Online that has much more significance than it actually appears to have.

So let us start at the beginning, the very beginning. For from the beginning you
shall know the end.

> The first ones were brothers: Anu and Padomay. They came into the Void, and
> Time began.

As Anu and Padomay wandered the Void, the interplay of Light and Darkness
created Nir. Both Anu and Padomay were amazed and delighted with her appearance,
but she loved Anu, and Padomay retreated from them in bitterness. – Annotated
Anuad

This is the time before Anu became the Godhead, where both his brother and
himself were simply inhabitants of the Dream that became before the current one.
We can safely assume that around this time Anu (and perhaps Padomay as well)
have CHIM. “They came into the Void, and Time began’ can be interpreted as them
discovering that everything is fake and becoming enlightened by this
information.

As the two learned about the Amaranth they resided in, they came across another:
Nir. A woman. The most beautiful woman you can imagine. A woman like them, a
woman they knew. And they knew her too. Anu and Padomay went to her, to begin
the next step, but she only cared for Anu (for he was selfless, and she could
sense the selfishness of Padomay’s nature). Padomay then drew away from them in
sadness and anger.

>
> _Annotated Anuad_{:tag="cite"}

Similar to how Jubal and Vivec in c0da join together to give birth to the
Nu-Men, Anu and Nir also do this. But Padomay was jealous; he wanted Nir to be
his wife, to be the father of the Amaranth she was carrying. When he came and
told Nir these things, she told him that she loved Anu. Padomay decided that if
he couldn’t have her, neither could Anu. So he beat her to the point where he
knew she wouldn’t be able to survive. Anu came and then proceeded to ‘cast’
Padomay out, choosing to forget him from this coming Amaranth and trapping them
in their native one. By the time he returned to Nir, she had already given birth
to the Twelve Nu-Men, the Twelve Worlds of Creation. She died, and Anu descended
into a miserable Dream built around suffering.

[Sadly, this is not the first time these events occurred. The tragic story of
Nir, Anu, and Padomay extends all the way to the Original Godhead. The Death of
the Catalyst is the only constant between Dreams, which is further explored in
An Uutak C0DA.]

> _Annotated Anuad_{:tag="cite"}

This part is crucial, for the first four sentences take place in the Previous
Amaranth while the last two take place in the Current Amaranth. The Twelve
Nu-Men are Dreaming, undisturbed and blissfully. Until Padomay returned to the
Amaranth, and in his rage fragmented the Nu-Men and disrupted their Dreaming.
This action woke up Anu and ended his Dream, who fought Padomay in a brutal
battle. At its end, he decided to save his children by trying to bring them into
a new Amaranth. Padomay, however, was gravely wounded but not defeated and rose
up to deal an equally grave wound to his brother. The end result was that Anu
brought Padomay into his New Dream (aka the TES Dream) but exiled both him and
his brother from it as well, resulting in Ald-Anu and Ald-Padomay and Dream-Anu
(Anuiel/Aetherius) and Dream-Padomay (Sithis/Void). This event happened both
inside and outside the Dream, and is mentioned in The Monomyth and the
Loveletter:

Don’t forget the Twelve Worlds, the Nu-Men. We’ll be getting to that later.

In context, the above is probably the reason why you barely hear references to
both Anu and Padomay in the games and rather just their counterparts. The former
aren’t in the Dream; the latter are though. Regardless, Anuiel and Sithis
intermix and create the Aurbis as we know it. Now, we’ll just be focusing on The
Elder Scrolls Dream from this moment forward.

>
> _Annotated Anuad_{:tag="cite"}

This part is meh, mostly because the general consensus is that the et’Ada formed
of their own will and there is no such thing as good or evil in TES. The passage
is more symbolic than anything, and is just telling us about the differentiating
natures of the original spirits back before time began. Those that were drawn to
the Void (Daedra), and therefore Sithis, were more malevolent. Those that were
drawn to Aetherius (Magnus & the Magne Ge), and therefore Anuiel, were more
benevolent. And those that were drawn to the Gray Center (Aedra), were mixtures
of both, anodyne.

But Auriel and Lorkhan were different. They were the “souls” of Anuiel and
Sithis, subgradients further down the aurbical-cord of the IS and IS NOT. Time
and Space, aspects of the same but wholly different. Lorkhan is more of a limit,
and this drives his brother insane.

Lorkhan eventually travels outside of the Aurbis, where he sees the Wheel as an
I and attains CHIM. But he realizes that the next step, Amaranth, can not be
attained for him or the others as long as they are immortal. He reads the
consciousness of Ald-Anu (which is still around even though he has no control of
his Dream) and those of Anuiel and Sithis (little as they are) and he discovers
something. Someone. Nir. Mother. An extension of all the previous Mothers of all
the Amaranths, the Catalyst. His desire to recreate her becomes the first ideas
for Mundus, a place where all others may self-reflect and ascend where he could
not.

So Lorkhan tricked, sweet talked, and explained his plan to some of the et’Ada.
These would become the Aedra and the Earthbones. The ones that refused his offer
would become the Daedra. And eventually, the Aedra that escaped back to
Aetherius would become the Magne-Ge. Magnus was the one that became the
Architect of the Mundus, but his schematics were just one of three. For Auriel
and Lorkhan crafted their own schematics, and eventually Nirn was a merger of
all three. Among other things. Yes, we’ve come to the part about the Ehlnofey
and the Hist.

> _Annotated Anuad_{:tag="cite"}

When most read this mind, it is simply telling us that the only species that
survived the Twelve Worlds of Creation that would eventually solidify into Nirn
were the Hist and the Ehlnofey. This is one of the main reasons why the
Annotated Anuad is sort of disregarded compared to the other creation myths. The
Hist are from outside the Current Dream, and the Ehlnofey are descended/created
from/by the gods. I would like to beg to differ. When I look at this passage, I
don’t see survivors of one of the worlds, I see surviving worlds. In other
words, ten out of the twelve were killed. Two survived.

In my eyes the Hist and the Ehlnofey are the surviving Amaranths, Anu’s
children, broken when their uncle Padomay shattered their Dreams. This left them
wounded – the Ehlnofey more so than their siblings the Hist – and unable to
Dream themselves anymore. So they (the Hist, I mean) decided to travel into the
next best thing, into the Dream of someone they cared for: their Father, Anu.
The Ehlnofey, left somewhat simple-minded to the point where they can’t even
remember they were Nu-Men, are brought into the Dream reluctantly by the Hist
due to the fact they can’t fend for themselves. They enter into Anu’s Dream with
fragments of the worlds they created, and observed the events of Creation.

Now, I can imagine what you are all thinking right now (‘IFW has finally gone
batshit insane’ coming to mind…get it? Echmer joke aw forget it…). I know, it’s
strange. But let’s look at something real quick for a second:

A baby made of flowers is the first of the Nu-Men. Flowers symbolize life,
beauty, birth, happiness, new things, etc. Now let’s take a look at the form we
know best from the Hist. First off, it’s been suspected by many that perhaps the
Hist are in fact an incorporeal entity that takes on the form of trees and whose
mind is unfathomable to all others. Something I actually agree with:

What do trees symbolize? Wisdom, old age, strength, etc. Things the Hist
certainly are. And thanks to evidence throughout all of the games (and further
supported in better detail in ESO) we know that the Hist are simulating their
own “miniature” Dream with Black Marsh and the Argonians. They can no longer be
an Amaranth themselves, but they can still mimic the process within their
Father’s Dream. Sadly, their younger kin the Ehlnofey can no longer do this,
incapable of such imitation. They would have to learn again the steps to
reaching the Amaranth.

So the Hist and the Ehlnofey (bringing pieces from their own and their now dead
siblings Dreams) are present during Creation. During the creation of the Mundus,
these orphans and their fragments are merged together with the energy of dying
et’Ada to form Nirn. They become the earthbones. The et’Ada we commonly know as
the gods and goddesses of Tamriel lose some parts of themselves, and due to the
untimes of the Dawn Era are able to walk on Nirn.

In this primordial state, there is no water on Nirn. Because water is actually
memory, and no one has died yet, the planet remains noticeably barren with no
continents. All landmasses stay as one until the Ehlnofey Wars. Speaking of
which…

The Ehlnofey are displaced upon arrival on Nirn from the fragment of their
Amaranth, which would come to be known as Tamriel. Some of them are able to find
this fragment and resettle it, becoming the ancestors of the merish races, the
“Old Ehlnofey”. The Elvish gods (although they weren’t known as that back then)
Auriel, Trinimac, and others take the Old Ehlnofey under their wing and the
kingdoms of Altmora and Aldmeris (also called Old Ehlnofey) are formed. These
kingdoms are heavily fortified from the dangers outside of them, and develop
high cultures based on glories long since passed.

Other Ehlnofey walk Nirn lost but together, roaming from place to place without
a true home. They become known as the Wandering Ehlnofey, and become strong to
the dangers of the world by facing adversity. Unlike the Old Ehlnofey, they have
embraced Nirn and all of her challenges. Eventually, they will become the
ancestors to all the races of men (albeit the Bretons). Lorkhan and the other
Mannish gods like Kyne and Stendarr become the rulers of the Wanderers and soon
their numbers become massive.

Eventually the Wanderers come across Old Ehlnofey, and are glad to be reunited
with their brethren. However, each faction sees that both have changed very much
and although biased against one another there is no conflict. The war between
them however begins due to the prejudices between the gods and the Ehlnofey Wars
begin bloodily across the entirety of Nirn. As we all know, Auriel leads the Old
Ehlnofey and Lorkhan leads the Wandering Ehlnofey; although the former are more
magically talented and tactical, the latter are more stronger and hardened and
soon the world itself is changed by these battles. As more Ehlnofey die, the
water level of Nirn begins to rise rapidly.

Altmora is captured by the Wanderers, who take it as a new homeland and rename
it Atmora. The forces of Auriel are forced to flee to Aldmeris, their last
stronghold against the armies of Lorkhan. However, it is fractured by the Space
God into smaller holdings on Nirn.

The Ehlnofey have a final conflict on Aldmeris, and the forces of Auriel win by
Trinimac ripping out Lorkhan’s heart, removing him from his divine spark. His
body begins to rot and becomes the moons Masser and Secunda. The Wanderers and
the Old Ehlnofey become rivals and enemies ever since this event, remaining
largely splintered from one another till this day.

Auriel calls a meeting involving all the Aedra to decide the fate of the Mundus
by slamming his vessel into Tamriel, creating the first Tower Adamantine as well
as starting to stabilize time. As punishment for his crimes, Lorkhan is to be
killed. However, Auriel and Trinimac soon discover that the Heart of Lorkhan can
not be destroyed and therefore toss it into the sea, where it forms the second
Tower Red Mountain and eventually the island of Vvardenfell. Magnus and other
like minded spirits escape from the Mundus and travel back to Aetherius before
time fully solidifies, leaving the stars and the sun behind in the uneasy
process. Magicka is therefore infinite, and the third Tower Snow-Throat is
created as they leave.

The oceans have now separated/broken off the landmasses from one another, as
well as sealing the Ehlnofey from another. This results in all of them changing,
creating the diverse races we know today.

Atmora breaks off from Old Ehlnofey to the North, and begins to freeze. It
becomes home to the Atmorans (Nords), and is being separated by the Sea of
Ghosts.

Akavir breaks off to the East, separated by the Padomaic Ocean. It becomes home
to the Tsaesci, Kamal, Ka Po’Tun, Tang Mo, and the Dovah.

Yokuda breaks off to the West, separated by the Eltheric Ocean. It becomes home
to the Yokudans (Redguards) and the Sinismer (Left-Handed Elves).

Aldmeris breaks off to the South and becomes the Summerset Isles (technically a
part of Old Ehlnofey), Thras, and Pyandonea. These lands are also separated by
the Eltheric Ocean. Despite shattered, it is still considered united during
these times. Only the Summersets are settled, by the Aldmer.

Old Ehlnofey remains where it is, and becomes Tamriel. It is home to the Nedes
(Cyrodiils, Kothringi, Keptu, etc.), Khajiit, and the Argonians and is cut off
from the other lands.

Smaller islands (Roscrea, Esrionet, Cathnoquey, Yneslea, etc.) remain isolated
and unsettled during these times.

Eventually, the Aldmer of Aldmeris have a religious schism and fracture into
many peoples. The Bosmer (Wood Elves), Chimer (Changed Elves), Falmer (Snow
Elves), Dwemer (Deep Elves), Ayleids (Heartland Elves), and Cepholomer (Dreugh)
all travel to Tamriel. The Maormer (Sea Elves) travel to Pyandonea. The ?mer
(Sload) travel to Thras. The remaining Aldmer become the Altmer (High Elves) of
Summerset. Aldmeris is destroyed, but it still remains as a spiritual concept of
unification and perfection among the merish peoples. The Khajiit are also of
Aldmeri stock, but were removed long ago.

Meanwhile, the Hist survive the Ehlnofey Wars and the Dawn Era on their Amaranth
fragment joined to Tamriel. However, the rising waters sinks most of their land
beneath the Padomaic Ocean. Black Marsh is all that remains, and the Hist begins
their Sim-Dream and creates the Argonians.

Creation, the Dawn Era, and the Merethic Era finally ends. Men eventually
returns to Tamriel after their long absence through different means, and Tamriel
stays that way for millennia until the next Amaranth begins.
