The Daedra Lords (also known as the Daedric Princes, the Lords of Tumult, or the
Princes of Misrule) are the et’Ada beings that exist in the infinite realm known
as Oblivion. They are the most powerful of the immortal beings that reside
there, and range seventeen in number. The names of these beings are Azura,
Boethiah, Clavicus Vile, Hermaeus Mora, Hircine, Jyggalag, Malacath, Mehrunes
Dagon, Mephala, Meridia, Molag Bal, Namira, Nocturnal, Peryite, Sanguine,
Sheogorath, and Vaermina.

Together, these beings are the forefront of the beings known as Daedra
(“Daedroth” is the singular form), and are thought of being the political system
of Oblivion. Since times immemorial, they have been worshipped openly and
secretly on Tamriel and commonly viewed as gods. Their powers are great, and in
this book we shall explore them further.

### The Origin Of The Daedric Princes

The Daedra (which translates into “not our ancestors” in Merish) are commonly
believed to be just the et’Ada that refused to help create Mundus. This in fact
false, as many of them (Malacath, Meridia, and perhaps Mehrunes Dagon and Molag
Bal) used to be other godly beings that were changed, while others (Hermaeus
Mora and some say Peryite and Hircine) were created from pieces of creatia on
accident or purpose. And Sheogorath is thought to be something else entirely.
Amongst more experienced scholars, Daedra are simply the et’Ada that choose to
exist in Oblivion rather than Aetherius.

We first learned of the names of some of the Daedra Lords by Hale the Pious, but
there have been constant mention of them in texts from the First Era and before.
The Alessians labeled them as “daimons”, creatures that were not meant to be
consorted with. However, their worship persisted regardless.

Each of the provinces have ancient Daedric venerations, but the ones with the
most legends are Skyrim, High Rock, Summerset, Morrowind, and Cyrodiil. The most
invaluable text about the Daedric Princes themselves is Maleficus Aeternus, an
ancient saga from High Rock. Combining the mannish and merish ways of thinking,
it seems to describe a war that takes place within Oblivion that caused the
formation of the ruling party of Oblivion. Maleficus Aeternus is still being
translated by many scholars, as it is considered a boon to the understanding of
the Daedra Lords.

The Daedra Lords considered “born” true Daedra are Azura, Boethiah, Clavicus
Vile, Jyggalag, Namira, Nocturnal, Sanguine, and Vaermina. Out of these eight,
Nocturnal is considered the “Ur-Dra”, or the First Daedra. Her influence causes
all of the other Lords to respect her, although this does brings up the question
if she is the most powerful of them all, which is debatable.

Malacath, Meridia, Mehrunes Dagon, and Molag Bal are considered the Daedra that
were once other et’Ada before becoming what they are today. Malacath, as is
widely known, was once the god-hero known as Trinimac before he was corrupted
(either eaten or defeated) by Boethiah, becoming what he is today. Ancient
Ayleid texts (notably the Tract of Merid-Nunda) paint Meridia as “wayward solar
daughter”, or a Magne-Ge that was banished from Aetherius. Some Breton-Nordic
myths paint Mehrunes Dagon as some sort of Aedric spirit who was cursed by
either Alduin or Akatosh. And in Morrowind, Molag Bal is sometimes believed to
have been a mysterious dreugh-like creature known as the Ruddy Man.

Hermaeus Mora, Hircine, and Peryite are considered the Daedra that were created
by raw creatia that formed into something on its own or was fashioned as such.
The worshippers of Hermaeus Mora often say that their master tells them that he
was born from the unused schematics for the Mundus Magnus threw away. Legends
about Hircine dictate he was the result of some “cosmic experiment” that fused
the thoughts of predators and prey together as one. And Peryite, through Nedic
texts, is thought to have been forged from a “ghost-shape-concept” floating in
the void for a specific duty.

Sheogorath, in Aldmeri tradition, is referred to having been created when
“Lorkhan’s divine spark was removed from this world”. Whether this states he was
created at the moment Trinimac ripped out the Doom Drum’s heart is unclear,
although a variation of this myth does call Sheogorath the “Sithis-shaped hole
in the world”, lending some credence to the theory.

### Mortal Views On The Princes

Some Tamrielics view the Daedra Lords as evil beings, some as good
beings, and others as both. In truth, these entities are beyond the mortal
concepts of good and evil, and merely act upon what they are desiring to do at
the moment. The correct word to describe them would be that they are
“maleficent”, but can also be benevolent on occasion as well.

The five Daedra Lords thought of being genuinely “evil” are Boethiah, Mehrunes
Dagon, Molag Bal, Vaermina, and Peryite. The spheres of these Princes are the
most destructive and harming towards mortals, and thus they are considered
sadistic to Tamrielics. Known together as “the Heralds of the End Times”, these
five will supposedly herald the end times: Boethiah will start Conquest,
Mehrunes Dagon will begin War, Molag Bal bestows Death, Vaermina shall bring
Famine, and Peryite will infect what remains with Pestilence. It is thought that
this labeling arose from ancient doctrines of the Alessian Empire, combined with
some Altmeri records.

Genders amongst the Daedra Lords are even more debated for bizarre reasons. For
once and for all, the Princes are genderless beings and may manifest as any
gender. Some of them take on male only guises, while others take on female only
guises. Others choose both, while some of them choose to not appear as anything
even remotely mannish, merish, or beastfolk-like.

### Aedra and Daedra Relations

Only the most foolish of mortals think that the Aedra and Daedra are mortal
enemies of one another: this is false. Although it is safe to say that some of
the Daedra Lords are irritated by the worshippers of their Aedric brethren, they
do not typically assault each other every day (or at least, to public knowledge
they don’t). However, I have included in this book a list of the Daedra that
oppose (or at the most, interfere with) the will of a specific Aedra:

Akatosh is opposed by worshippers of Hermaeus Mora, Peryite, Azura, and
Vaermina.

Arkay is opposed by Molag Bal, Namira, Meridia, and Peryite.

Dibella is opposed by Namira, Sanguine, Mephala, Molag Bal, and Malacath.

Julianos is opposed by Hermaeus Mora, Azura, Mephala, Jyggalag, Boethiah,
Clavicus Vile, and Sheogorath.

Kynareth is opposed by Hircine, Namira, Meridia, and Mehrunes Dagon.

Mara is opposed by Sanguine, Mephala, Molag Bal, and Malacath.

Stendarr is opposed by Boethiah, Mehrunes Dagon, Jyggalag, Sheogorath, and
Vaermina.

Zenithar is opposed by Clavicus Vile, Peryite, and Jyggalag. ###Daedric Princes
In Tamrielic Religions Azura is worshipped primarily in Elsweyr and Morrowind,
where she plays important roles in the creation of those two provinces most
prominent denizens. She was the one that cursed the ancient Chimer into becoming
the modern day Dunmer, and was responsible in creating the Khajiit from Aldmeri.
The Dunmer also venerate her as one of the three “Good Daedra”, although her
worship has been supplanted by the Tribunal known as Sotha Sil.

Boethiah is worshipped primarily in Morrowind as one of the three “Good Daedra”.
She/he “ate” Trinimac, and defecated him out as Malacath. This is one of the key
events of the Velothi Exodus, which led the Chimer (the ancestors of the Dunmer)
to modern day Morrowind. Hir worship was eventually supplanted by the Tribunal
known as Almalexia.

Clavicus Vile is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any
Tamrielic religion. Despite this, early documents of his worship can be found
mainly in High Rock amongst the early Bretons. In them, he is seen as “financial
backer” of early kings and queens, and granting dark wishes for the nobility.

Hermaeus Mora is worshipped primarily in Elsweyr, Skyrim, and Valenwood. The
Khajiit view him as a driving force of fate, and refer to him as the “Tides”. To
the Nords he was one of the greatest enemies of Ysgramor, and often tried to
trick them into becoming mer. To the Bosmer, he is also trickster, residing in
the darkest regions of their forests.

Hircine is worshipped primarily in Elsweyr and Valenwood. The Khajiit revere him
for he represents feline cunning and fierceness, and is known as the “Hungry
Cat”. The Bosmer worship him as the more dangerous side of the forest that helps
them with their hunting.

Jyggalag is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any
Tamrielic religion. Actually, his cults are virtually nonexistent. Rumors abound
that his last remaining followers inhabit the Summerset Isles, where the more
“open-minded” Altmer respect the nature of his sphere.

Malacath is worshipped primarily in Hammerfell, Morrowind, Skyrim, and amongst
the Orcs, and is also worshipped (as Trinimac) in the Summerset Isles. Before
his transformation, he was a god-hero of the Altmer and is still slightly
worshipped by them. The Redguards view him as an enemy god that attempted to
repel their settling of modern-day Hammerfell. In Morrowind religion, he is one
of the “Four Corners of the House of Troubles” and tests the Dunmer for physical
weaknesses. In Skyrim, he was an enemy of King Harald and his heirs. To the Orcs
he is their god-king because as he was transformed into Trinimac, they were
created from the mer that transformed with him.

Mehrunes Dagon is primarily worshipped in Elsweyr and Morrowind. The Khajiit
view him as a destructive kitten, and represents children without proper
instruction. In Morrowind he is one of the “Four Corners of the House of
Troubles” and tests the Dunmer on their survivability, and represents
Morrowind’s hostile landscape.

Mephala is primarily worshipped in Elsweyr and Morrowind. To the Khajiit, she/he
is represents their Clan Mothers and holds secrets. The Dunmer view her as one
of the three “Good Daedra”, where she taught them to defeat their many enemies
when they were still Chimer by teaching them the arts of assassination. The
Morag Tong was founded by her. Hir worship has since been supplanted by the
Tribunal known as Vivec.

Meridia was primarily worshipped by the Ayleids of Cyrodiil before their
extinction, and nowhere else. To them she represented their fourth element,
“light”. The ancient enemy of Pelinal Whitestrake, Umaril the Unfeathered, was
her champion.

Molag Bal is primarily worshipped in Morrowind. He is the greatest adversary of
the Dunmer people as one of the “Four Corners of the House of Troubles”. He
constantly tries to corrupt and destabilize the Dunmeri race as a whole, and is
alleged of populating the land with monsters after seducing the Triune Vivec.

Namira is only worshipped in Elsweyr. To the Khajiit she is the “Great
Darkness”, and responsible for the corruption of the entity known as Lorkhan.

Nocturnal is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any
Tamrielic religion. The earliest accounts of her worship is in Skyrim, where
some myths view her as a matron of those who prefer to dwell and walk in the
dark.

Peryite is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any Tamrielic
religion. He seems to have been a “fickly” deity to the ancient Nedes of
Cyrodiil, where the earliest legends mention him are from. At some times he was
a benevolent creature that aided slaves, in others a sinister one that killed
them.

Sanguine is primarily worshipped in Elsweyr. To the Khajiit he is known as the
“Blood Cat”, who always acts on every impulse he feels and represents the “blood
urge” of the Khajiiti people.

Sheogorath is primarily worshipped in Elsweyr and Morrowind. He is the “Skooma
Cat”, and represents chaos and the frowning down upon too much structure in
their society. In Morrowind he is one of the “Four Corners of the House of
Troubles”, and tests the Dunmer for mental weaknesses.

Vaermina is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any
Tamrielic religion. Earliest records indicate her worship began in High Rock,
amongst early artists and other professions that require applications of
creativity. ###Notes On The Daedric Princes Below is an in-depth look at each of
the Daedra Lords, combining well known and obscure facts about these entities in
each entry:

## Azura (Twilight Eternal)

Azura is the Daedric Prince of Dawn, Dusk, Twilight, and Prophecy. She is also
the Embodiment of Clairvoyance. She is one of the Princes that is considered
very benevolent to mortalkind, but her wrath is said to be able to destroy
entire lands. Because of this, most of her worshippers venerate her without
question and are rewarded beyond pleasure. She is capable of seeing only into
the future through her ties with the twilight, and is often associated with
hidden beauty. She often takes on the form of a Dunmeri woman wearing a low-neck
or topless blue dress and short hair. Daedra called Winged Twilights are her
unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is known as Moonshadow, which is
blindingly beautiful and colorful, with flowers, waterfalls, trees, and an
alleged silver city.

## Boethiah (Mistress of Discord)

Boethiah is the Daedric Prince of Deceit, Conspiracy, and Secret Plots of
Murder. He is also the Embodiment of Strife. He is one of the few Princes that
constantly shifts between male and female form, but is mostly always a male. He
is heavily invested in the politics of the mortal races, and is well known for
being indirectly instrumental in the starting of wars between nations; this can
be tied to his love for competition and battle. Interesting, he seems to
constantly create policies for his worshippers. He often takes on the form of a
Dunmeri man wearing red-caped armor and wielding a blade of ebony. Daedra called
Hungers are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as Attribution’s
Share, a land of maze gardens and labyrinthine towers where politics are
intertwined with battle.

## Clavicus Vile (The Wishing Hound)

Clavicus Vile is the Daedric Prince of Power, Wishes, and Pacts. He is also the
Embodiment of Covenants. He makes deals with mortals in their hopes for him
upholding his bargain, which he does: just in a way that they may come to
regret. He is one of the Princes most fond of interfering in the lives of
mortals, and is likes the use of irony amongst the wishes he grants. Most of the
time, death is an acceptable solution in the deals he makes. His worshippers
believe him ruthless, brutal, but truthful and honest in his transactions. He
seems to greatly admire those that outsmart him in his deals with them. He often
takes on the form of a small boy with horns wearing a nice suit, and with a dog
always at his side that he converses with. Daedra called Jinn are his unique
servants. His plane of Oblivion is thought to be called Desideratum, a place of
tranquil countrysides and vibrant merchant cities of forever bargaining.

## Hermaeus Mora (Keeper of the Forest)

Hermaeus Mora is the Daedric Prince of Memory, Fate, Knowledge, and Destiny. He
is also the Embodiment of Comprehension. He is the holder of all learning, which
he is fiercely protective about. Some of his worshippers say that he is capable
of subjugating the Time Dragon’s influence, and is able to see both into the
future as well as the past. He is associated with woods, which represent untamed
and unknown knowledge. He is also well known for presenting powerful tomes of
hidden knowledge to mortals, in exchange for the aid of routing out the
knowledge he does not possess. He often takes on the form of a mass of grotesque
green tentacles, eyes, and a pair of crab-like pincers. Daedra called Seekers
and Lurkers are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as
Apocrypha, and manifests as an endless library of knowledge from multiple time
periods.

## Hircine (Commander of Beasts)

Hircine is the Daedric Prince of Hunting, Beasts, and the Darker Aspects of the
Forest. He is also the Embodiment of Predation. He is the creator of all the
forms of lycanthropy, who fit perfectly into his sphere: they prey at night and
are preyed upon in the morning. He represents the more dangerous aspects of
nature, such as the enjoyment of the kill rather than the act of it for
substance and the thrill of the chase rather than simply tracking the animal. He
often takes on the form of a muscular man wearing a loincloth with the head of a
deer and wielding a spear, accompanied by a wolf. Daedra called Stalkers are his
unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as the Hunting Grounds, a realm
of great forests and open plains inhabited by fierce animals.

## Jyggalag (Crystal Knight)

Jyggalag is the Daedric Prince of Logical Order, Perfection, and Rigidity. He is
also the Embodiment of Intransigence. He is thought to be one of the strongest
of the Daedra Lords, and commands many legions in Oblivion. Strangely, his
worship is almost nonexistent in Tamriel and few references are made to him in
books. Perhaps he has become tired of the Mundus and has redrawn into Oblivion,
for even his realm is now inaccessible to mortals. He often takes on the form of
a warrior made entirely out of shining crystal. Daedra called the Knights of
Order are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as the Silver
Prisms, which appears a realm of grey sand and towering buildings of silver
crystals, each tiered to sheer perfection.

## Malacath (Patron of the Spurned)

Malacath is the Daedric Prince of Curses, Strength, and the Ostracized. He is
also the Embodiment of Acquiescence. He hates physical weakness, and strives to
push mortals into becoming stronger than they naturally are. He also seems to
have contempt for mental weakness as well, and is often thought to act dumb to
fool his enemies. He protects the exiled and those who are looked down upon,
like he himself is. He is often the outcast other outcasts turn to for guidance.
Daedra called Ogrim are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as
the Ashpit, a realm of choking air and buildings made out of cinders meant to
test the strength of those who enter it.

## Mehrunes Dagon (Four Arms of the Razor)

Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Prince of Destruction, Revolution, and Ambition.
He is also the Embodiment of Change. He is constantly destroying everything he
comes into contact with and is known for his quick-to-anger temperament and
slow-thinking mind. He is the force that instills in every mortal to rise
against those that lead them, although he may not be directly behind said
risings. He often takes on the form of a man with four arms and orange skin
wearing a loincloth and wielding a large axe of some sort. Daedra called
Clannfears are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is the Deadlands, a
realm of black islands, towers, and lava rivers.

## Mephala (Madame at the Loom)

Mephala is the Daedric Prince of Lies, Sex, Secrets, and Murder. Ze is also the
Embodiment of Existence. Ze is one of the few Princes that constantly shifts
between male and female form, but is usually referred to as female. Hir
worshippers view her as the one who oversees life being created and the one who
ends it swiftly. This is usually manifested as hir weaving the threads
containing the secrets of mortals together so intricately to cut one is to two.
She often takes on the form of Dunmer hermaphrodite wearing the attire of an
assassin, and wielding a longblade. Daedra called simply the Spider Daedra are
her unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is rumored to be called the Web, a
place woven out of hidden thoughts. It has always been inaccessible to living
mortals.

## Meridia (Sparkle in the Darkness)

Meridia is the Daedric Prince of Life, Energy, and Cleansing. She is also the
Embodiment of Purity. She is one of the Princes who is considered kindhearted
and benevolent. She has an intense hatred for all manners of undead like
vampires and zombies, viewing them as revolting abominations. She supposedly
lights the way to the clearing of the mind and body. She often takes on the form
of lady glowing with dazzling light or fire. Daedra called Aurorans are her
unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is The Colored Rooms, which are a vast
space of beautiful multicolor crystals shining intensely.

## Molag Bal (Defiler of Spirits)

Molag Bal is the Daedric Prince of Domination, Tarnishment, and the Enslavement
of Mortals. He is also the Embodiment of Sovereignty. He is considered one of
the truly “evil” Princes, due to his horrible acts against mortalkind. He has an
obsession with souls, and is the creator of soul gems. He is also the creator of
the vampire race, who share several of his characteristics. Depraved acts like
rape were invented by him, for which he holds no shame. In fact, he feels for
none but himself. He often takes on the form of a green reptilian creature
adorned with skulls. Daedra called Daedroths and Harvesters are his unique
servants. His plane of Oblivion is Coldharbour, which is just a stigmatized copy
of Tamriel.

## Namira (Putrefying Queen)

Namira is the Daedric Prince of Decay, Darkness, and Revulsion. She is also the
Embodiment of Entropy. Revolting creatures like insects, spiders, and vermin are
considered part of her influence. She is the matron of beggars, who live in vile
conditions but do not complain about it. She is considered the second to come
from the Void, and is the personification of its ability to corrupt individuals.
Horrid acts frowned down upon in society is always acceptable to her. She often
takes on the form of a beautiful lady who is also a corpse on further inspection
wearing a green dress with a sickly creature accompanying her. Daedra called
Jermariuns are her unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is the Scuttling Void,
a black abyss filled with revolting monsters. It has always been inaccessible to
living mortals.

## Nocturnal (The Perished)

Nocturnal is the Daedric Prince of the Night, Stealth, and Shadow. She is also
the Embodiment of Obscurity. She is beloved by thieves, because they find hiding
places in the shadows she creates. She represents carnal mystery for mortals,
which is slowly revealed away through exploration. She is also linked to luck,
which is one of her “gifts” on Mundus. Her followers say she is the
personification of the Void’s enigmas, and the first to come from it. She often
takes on the form of a beautiful lady cloaked in pitch-black robes with ravens
on her shoulders. Daedra called Rapinas are her unique servants. Her plane of
Oblivion is Ebongloam, a realm of perpetual twilight.

## Peryite (Warden of the Equipoise)

Peryite is the Daedric Prince of Tasks, Natural Order, and Pestilence. He is
also the Embodiment of Balance. He makes sure that all opposing forces have an
equally opposing force moving against it and that everything has a purpose. Most
of his “blessings” are actually curses as well, for he always plays both sides
and never just one. Diseases are the prime example of this, and it is rumored he
is connected to the Thrassian Plague. Some of his worshippers refer to him as
“the Shadow of Aka” and he often takes on the form of a green dragon to mock the
Time Dragon. Daedra called Vavasours are his unique servants. His plane of
Oblivion is The Pits, a realm of infinite holes in the ground that contains ooze
rivers and violent disease storms. It has always been inaccessible to living
mortals.

## Sanguine (Reveling Maniac)

Sanguine is the Daedric Prince of Hedonism, Debauchery and Dark Indulgences. He
is also the Embodiment of Passion. He is one of the most active Princes in
mortal lives, and attempts to liven up what he refers to as our “drab and dull
existence”. At some times, he is kind and throws extravagant wine and dancing
parties. In others, he is self-indulgent and conducts wild, drunken, and bloody
orgies. Most fitting, considering he is both the light and dark sides of fun. He
often takes on the form of horned red-skinned creature wearing flamboyant robes,
with a virgin clinging to his shoulder and a constantly refilling wine glass in
his hand. Daedra called Plaisirs are his unique servants. He owns over a
thousand realms in Oblivion, collectively known as Sanguine’s Little Pleasures,
which are used as pockets of fun for him and his followers.

## Sheogorath (The Learned Lunatic)

Sheogorath is the Daedric Prince of Disorder, Chaos, Capriciousness, and
Personality. He is also the Embodiment of Madness. He is one of the most
unpredictable Princes; one second a nice gentleman-like fellow and the next a
murderous sociopath. Strangely, he is often tied to isolation and “knowledge
that was not meant to be known”, with both resulting in insanity. His own
bizarre words depict himself as “born from the corpse of the world-maker”. He
often takes on the form of a old man wearing a nice suit, to lead those
surprised of the “true” face of madness down the road to insanity. Daedra called
Mazken and Aureals are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is the
Shivering Isles, a realm that only those on their way to lunacy can enter.

## Vaermina (Lady of Visions)

Vaermina is the Daedric Prince of Dreams, Nightmares, Evil Omens, and Torture.
She is also the Embodiment of Imagination. She is believed to collect mortal
experiences and warp them beyond recognition, creating the tranquil and
horrifying realities mortals inhabit while they’re asleep. Signs such as
haunting ghosts or a shiver down the spine are also attributed to her, because
she is believed to delight in people knowing something bad is about to happen
although they don’t know when. She often takes on the form of an old lady with a
walking stick accumulating fog around her. Daedra called Truiva are her unique
servants. Her plane of Oblivion is called Quagmire, a realm that constantly
morphs from one terrifying image to another.
