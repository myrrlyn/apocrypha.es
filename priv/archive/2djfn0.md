## Azura’s Star

Azura’s Star is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact and is usually
considered a “blessing” to her followers. It is a soul gem crafted in the shape
of a star, and has unlimited uses for those that use it. However, it can only
contain white souls. Despite this limitation however, many stories dictate
corruptions of the Star that allow it to become capable of trapping black souls.
These stories remain unconfirmed at present.

## Dawnbreaker

Dawnbreaker is Meridia’s signature artifact and burns with her intense hatred
for the undead. Apparently forged from “holy light”, it causes all manners of
undead that are struck by it – including vampires – to catch aflame and may
cause them to explode, which causes a Turn Undead effect on the remaining undead
present. For normal enemies, it just burns them painfully. It is said that the
more often the wielder uses it, the more ‘pure’ they begin to feel.

## Ebony Mail

The Ebony Mail is Boethiah’s signature artifact. According to some legends, it
was once the attire of the hero-god Trinimac that became pure ebony after it was
splattered with the blood of a “fallen god”. When the hero-god was eaten by the
Prince, the Mail became a symbol of their power. It is worn by those that can
lead others, and grants its wearer protection to both fire and magicka, protects
them from physical blows, muffles their movements, and may poison attackers who
come to close.

## Ebony Blade

The Ebony Blade is Mephala’s signature artifact. Ancient legends say that the
Blade was once the weapon of the hero-god Trinimac before his transformation. It
became made of Ebony after it was covered in the blood of a “fallen god”, and
Prince took it as her own. The artifact drains the stamina of its victims and
transfers it to the wielder. The Blade is also said to grow even stronger if the
wielder murders their close friends.

## Helm of Jyggalag

The Helm of Jyggalag is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact he bestows to
mortals. For those that wear the Helm, it clears the mind of all but the most
logical of thoughts and everything you do is more orderly, including the things
you say. Others will find you more agreeable and likable in this state as well.
It – in essence – makes the wearer as “perfect” as they can naturally be. It
hasn’t been seen in centuries, in the same manner as its creator’s
disappearance, but was described as a crystal crown with a face-mask.

## Hircine’s Ring

Hircine’s Ring is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact and is usually
bestowed on those more beast than man. It has the ability to grant lycanthropes
of all kinds the ability to transform at will at any time of the day, and not
only at night. For normal mortals, it just enhances the senses to that of an
animal’s. However, through greater study of it, the Ring may bestow the disease
of lycanthropy to those that wish it.

## Mace of Molag Bal

The Mace of Molag Bal is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact and is
considered a weapon of “evil”. It has the ability to drain both the stamina and
magicka of the wielder’s opponent and give it to it’s user, allowing easier
dispatching of an attacker. The Mace exhibits a corrupting aura, and the more
deaths caused by it the more selfish and cruel the wielder becomes.

## Masque of Clavicus Vile

The Masque of Clavicus Vile is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact. It is
said that the Prince gave the Masque, which he used to wear all the time, to the
first mortal who outsmarted one of his deals. However, there was one condition:
that the Masque would be used for creating more false-truths. It seems that the
artifact has inherited its creator’s likeness, for those that wear it find their
words honeyed and more capable of convincing others.

## Mehrunes’ Razor

Mehrunes’ Razor is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact and his favorite
tool for change. According to some legends, the Razor was forged by ethereal
beings that gave him the weapon. It is incredibly powerful, as it has the chance
to kill anything with a single blow. Those that wield it will always find
themselves in positions that advocate destruction or revolution.

## Namira’s Ring

Namira’s Ring is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact she gives to mortals.
It functions as a living mirror, and causes the pain and suffering inflicted on
the wielder to be also felt in the attacker. It also increases the stamina of
the wielder as well. According to myth, the longer the Ring is worn the more
repulsive the wielder becomes, even causing revolting acts such as cannibalism
that give them strength and heals them.

## Oghma Infinium

The Oghma Infinium is a tome of incredible knowledge that is Hermaeus Mora’s
signature artifact. It was created by the Merish god Xarxes, who named it after
his wife Oghma. The book bestows incredible learning on those who read it, and
then vanishes before the person who acquired it gets to finish it. The book is
actually a trap set by the Prince, meant to lure those in the pursuit of hidden
knowledge to his realm.

## Sanguine’s Rose

Sanguine’s Rose is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact he gifts to
mortals. It has the ability to summon an uncontrollable lesser daedra that will
attack enemies. It appears as an actual or large metal rose, that wilts before
another one grows in its place after continuous use. It represents both the fun
and bloody sides of Sanguine, and it is said those that study it can eventually
learn how to control and change the daedra it summons.

## Skeleton Key

The Skeleton Key is Nocturnal’s signature artifact and is made out of her
essence. It has the incredible ability to unlock any door, which makes it highly
prized by thieves. It also allegedly has – through intense study – the ability
to unlock potential in the wielder, making them dangerously proficient at
everything they do.

## Skull of Corruption

The Skull of Corruption is the signature artifact of Vaermina, and is made out
of her essence. It is a staff capable of creating ethereal clones of those it is
used on, which will then fight for its wielder. During the creation of the
clone, it also makes and absorbs copies of the victim’s memories which are sent
directly to Vaermina herself. The staff is also said to have a mind of his own,
and enjoys the acts of mental torture it inflicts on its victims.

## Spellbreaker

Spellbreaker is the signature artifact of Peryite, and once belonged to the
Dwemeri Rourken clan. It appears as an uniquely designed Dwemer shield, and has
the ability to protect the wearer from both magical and physical attacks. The
shield played an important role in the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, where it is
said to have been created by the two combining their abilities before being
imbued with the Prince’s power. Due to its balance-like nature, Peryite took it
as a representation of his sphere and those that use it for imbalance will find
it vanish on them immediately.

## Volendrung

Volendrung is the signature artifact of Malacath, and also once belonged to the
Rourken clan; it is in fact the same hammer that the chieftain of the Rourken
threw to find a new home to live, the landing spot being Volenfell, or
present-day Hammerfell. It appears as an ebony warhammer, but has also been
rumored to take on the appearance of a blade. Malacath made the weapon a symbol
of his power because the Rourken were outcasts, which fall under his sphere, and
only those that feel like or are outcasts may wield it.

## Wabbajack

The Wabbajack is Sheogorath’s signature artifact and was created from his
essence. It takes on the form of an ebony staff carved with the ability to
change its victims shape, restore their health, or instantly kill them. However,
these effects are entirely random and cannot be anticipated. The weapon itself
is a tool to make those that wield it insane, due to their attempts to guess its
unpredictable outcomes.
