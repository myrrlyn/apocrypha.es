\[Original and Unaltered Manuscript\]

I have always been fond of the Imperial Geographical Society ever since I was a
child. Now as an adult, I was able to convince the association itself to allow
me to sit down with one of its most prestigious members. After meeting with him,
we both agreed to the questioning session at the Arcane University around
midnight, because the scholar was a close friend of Archmage Hannibal Traven.

I was sipping a glass of wine when the Argonian came in through the door and sat
down. His scales were an unusually pale dark greenish-blue, and his eyes bright
yellow. He wore medium armor native to his homeland, and his teeth were sharp.
Very sharp. We shook one another’s hands.

_Greetings, Sir! Could You Please Tell Me Your Full Name And Station So I Can
Commit It To Record?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** My name is Eis Vuur Warden, formally known as Kaxith-Vel. I
am an Argonian obviously, and a historian, writer, and scholar of the Imperial
Geographical Society.

_Ah, Thank You For Your Honesty. Um, If You Don’t Me Saying…You Are Rather Pale
For An Argonian. And Your Fangs, Along With The Matter Of Having Me Meet You At
Night…Are You A Vampire By Any Chance?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** You have guessed correct young scholar, good job. I am in
fact a vampire, and very old. How old you say? Well, I was born sometime at the
beginning of the Second Era and I’m still alive today, so it would seem to be
several millennia. I have watched armies rise and fall over the Ruby Throne,
lived through Dragon Breaks, and written essays about the deaths of the Tribunal
themselves. It is weird, saying that one has ‘outlived’ a god. But please, do
not tell anyone about my…condition. It has been a very closely guarded secret,
and I did not mask my appearance today because I believed you would not be
frightened by it.

_Trust Me Sir, I Have Seen My Fair Share Of Vampires. Your Secret Is Safe With
Me. Regarding Your Mention Of The Tribunal, Did You Know Any Of Them Personally?
Have You Met Any Other ‘Infamous’ People In Tamriel?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Ah, I was able to meet Lady Almalexia during my time as a
contract-scribe for the Ebonheart Pact. That was so many years ago. While we
weren’t ‘close’ in the traditional sense of friendship, we were still good
associates. I was quite surprised and saddened to hear about her death at the
hands of the Nerevarine. But, I suppose it had to be done. Can’t have suicidal
gods running amok now, can we? While I don’t particularly understand the last
question regarding other infamous people, I can tell you I have met the sorcerer
Divayth Fyr, the Ancient Sage of Solitude, several Emperors, and many more.
Members of the Society should always be prepared to meet with powerful figures.
It’s in our job description.

_What Exactly Are The Duties Of A Society Member? Do You Enjoy This Profession?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Society members have many duties. First and foremost, we
are the ones that chart the environments and history of the peoples of Tamriel.
For example, we are the ones that write the Pocket Guides to the Empire, and all
of its province-specific derivatives. We also write, draw, and translate essays,
novels, glyphs, paintings, and other such things. Something that few people know
is that we are also trained to be successful diplomats during our frequent
travels to defuse tenuous situations. You never know which province hates you
the most until you’re close enough to say hi.

My duties are bit more advanced than the typical member, mostly because of my
condition and my longstanding membership. I’m usually handed the most dangerous
assignments, ones where there are more than a fifty percent chance of dying. But
of course, those are the ones that are the most fun. I hate desk jobs; they make
my already boring existence even more boring. But yes, my job is
very…interesting, to say the least.

_Are Members Required To Be Able To Perform Multiple Functions?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Ha, what kind of question is that! Of course we are, didn’t
you hear me at the beginning? I am a historian as well as a scholar. I have also
written many fiction and nonfiction literature for the general populace. I am
also a cosmologist, because I was always fascinated by the universe ever since I
was a young hatchling. And while I do more things than that, those four are the
ones I do frequently. Unless you’re hiring me for something. Shall we begin
discussing numbers?

_Ha, No I’m Not Hiring You Sir. How Did You Come To Find Yourself Working For
The IGS?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Hmm…I remember it like it was yesterday. You see, I was
once a worshipper of the Daedric Prince you know as Peryite. I did some…rather
unscrupulous things under his command that I would rather not get into now.
However, I caught the vampiric disease known as Serratus Peryiphim while leading
a skirmish into the den of some Molag Bal worshippers. Normally, vampires
enraged my former master to no end. However, this particular strain had…certain
ties to the Taskmaster and because I was one of his most loyal followers he let
me live, although I was exiled from his sight for all eternity.

I wandered the Marsh for years without a true purpose, afraid I would eventually
be discovered and my unwanted immortality would come to an end by some cutthroat
hunter. Due to the impressive Illusion abilities of the Whet-Fang, I made a
living doing scribe work for some of my more benevolent cousins by disguising my
appearance. But then I caught the attention of some mysterious Imperial
gentleman; apparently, my writing skills were very topnotch and he thought I
should travel to Cyrodiil to work for the Imperials there. I had been born a
slave in Morrowind, and had done writing work for my Dunmeri masters in Deshaan
before I escaped with a few Khajiit.

Although I was at first wary of this proposition, I eventually decided to walk
down this path. I simply believed I had nothing left to lose besides my life,
and I was growing tired of that anyway. I left the Marsh by traveling through
the highlands of Murkmire and entered Cyrodiil, where I decided to change my
name. When I arrived in the Imperial City, I knew my life would be changed
forever. I became a writer for many institutions, and even joined the Mages
Guild. Of course I’m no longer a member now, but they have kept my secret safe
for all these years and I still help them out from time to time. And then I
stumbled onto the Society, and they grabbed my attention.

_How Were You Inducted Into The Society?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Doing the hardest test I’ve ever had to go through. First,
I had to rewrite five ancient tomes that were already falling apart and were
missing words so they could be reprinted. Then I had to had to paint an accurate
picture of Lake Rumare during a storm. And after that, I had to travel to all
nine provinces and bring back a sample of each of their environs without
damaging a single one. Last but not least they wanted to test my fighting
prowess, so I had to fight five wolves at once. I passed out for eight days
straight, but it was worth it in the long run.

Or maybe I’m just pulling your leg and all I had to do was talk to the guild’s
leader, who sent me out to identify which manuscript out of two was the farce
one. Although, I do still have scars from wolf bites on my right arm. They throb
from time to time when the weather acts up. Ugh, I must be getting old.

_What Is The Life Expectancy Of A Member Of The Society?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** With all honesty? It’s pretty short. Even for me, and I’m
an immortal Argonian vampire with over a thousand years in experience. I can
count about fifteen times in the last couple of weeks where I nearly lost my
hide. It’s a dangerous job. Probably easily the most dangerous job sponsored by
the Empire itself. Well, maybe tied with the Mages and Fighters Guilds.

It’s one of the reasons why I don’t marry. Well, that and other things. You
wouldn’t believe the allegations from angry Argonian youngsters about me being
their father, though. Thankfully none of them were true.

_Hmm…Is It Alright For Scholars To Have Other Professions Outside Of The
Society?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** If you need the septims or want more excitement. I was a
member of the Mages Guild for sometime, and was even their expert on conjuration
until I faked my death when some of the more bigoted members started getting
suspicious. I still have close ties with their leadership though, as you can see
it.

I thought about the Fighters Guild. But I rather not get beat up for a living; I
rather settle my disputes with words, although I do enjoy a good fight now and
then.

_Master Of Conjuration, Eh? Do You Travel To The Outer Realms?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Well…yes. But I shouldn’t speak of that because I would be
breaking promises with some rather powerful mages. I knew how to travel to
Oblivion with various techniques before, but not with the ease I have now. Most
of my writings on Daedra stems from these travels.

_My Last Question, Dear Eis: Would You Ever Cure Your Vampirism And Die A
Mortal?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Not a day goes by when I don’t think that, son. Immortality
may sound pleasing at first, but honestly – what would you do with eternity? My
parents, my cousins, my entire family is long since dead and returned to the
Hist. I can’t travel into the sunlight without exploding into ash. Having my own
hatchlings is out of the question; who knows how they will be when they grow up?
It is not easy outliving your closest friends, and while you can always make new
ones your heart will forever ache over the ones you lost. Son, eternity sucks.
Plain and simple. Sometimes, when I’m feeling extremely depressed, I think about
standing naked in front of the sun and soaking in its warm embrace for one last
time.

But then I think about all the work I’ve done, and well, it stops me. I helped
write most if not all of the Pocket Guides, treaties, pamphlets, and other
literary works of the Empire. Knowing that I have personally helped advocate
peace makes me happy enough to continue on. One day, perhaps I will eventually
die. But not today. This old Saxhleel still has a couple more things he needs to
write and say.

_Beautiful. The Sun Will Be Coming Up Soon, Sir. Shall We End This?_

**Eis Vuur Warden:** That sounds like a good idea. We will have to speak again,
my friend, at a later date. Until then, may you stay moist.

Good Day, Sir. And Good Luck.
