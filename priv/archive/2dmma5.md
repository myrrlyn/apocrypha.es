Magnus had risen over the horizon, and his rays fell upon my Colovian head,
indicating that it was time that I had risen from my sleep. Elena was already
awake, and was reading through the essay I had wrote as part of my course at the
IGS. I watched her mouth change into a smile as big as a skooma-happy Khajiit;
whether this was because of the Dunmer and the pumpkin joke I had intentionally
left in or because of the theory I had proposed that Callonius Elbos hadn’t been
present at the Umbriel Crisis connecting a thousand and one heads with his blade
as he had told many a time to the younger ladies of the Imperial City, but
instead was sleeping in a whorehouse in Bravil and was using his “blade” for
other purposes, I wasn’t entirely sure.

Elena rose from the Imga-ken leather futon she was lying on, and placed my essay
back inside her desk. “I must say Hron, your writing style is most impressive. I
haven’t met many Colovians who could string along more than two sentences
together, nevermind a five-thousand word manuscript. I should think you would be
a most welcome addition to the Imperial Geographical Society when you graduate.”
I smiled at the praise my tutor gave me. “Thank you, Miss Alonius. I must have
been gifted with the art of writing by my mother before she passed.” Elena tied
her long ebony hair back into a ponytail and threw a pile of empty books towards
me. “Niben, was she?” I nodded my head in agreement. “With a hint of Tsaeci
blood in her as well, miss.”

Elena opened her wardrobe, debated to herself about which garment she should
wear, and settled on a lavendar cloak with the sigil of House Indarys sown with
Emperor’s Gold on the back. “If you hadn’t guessed already Hron, we aren’t
staying in the Forum today. I have arranged a meeting with someone special in
New Narsis and as part of your new assignment I want you to record what is said
between myself and our friend.” I exhaled in disappointment. “New Narsis
_again_? But I’ve already written extensively about the fall of House Hlaalu,
and surely you remember what happened with those Argonians last time I was in
the district?” I pulled up my left trouser leg to remind my tutor of the large
scar upon my limb after one of the lizards tried to bite it off. “I can assure
you that you won’t be attacked by the Argonians again. And if I do recall
correctly, the incident was caused by _your_ lack of proper etiquette around
them. Anyway, we aren’t going that far west. Our meeting is in the east of the
district.” I gave Elena look of confusion “With the Dreughs? Why are meeting
with them?” Elena shook her head. “If I was you, I wouldn’t refer to them as
Dreughs when you are around them, or you’ll get a lot worse than a simple
nibble. The Imperial Geographical Society have little to no information about
the tribe that call themselves the Cephalo; and after much negotiation the
priests at the Temple of Xacses have granted our organisation permission to
speak with a member. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to pass up on, and
you should consider yourself lucky that you shall be in attendance.” I tossed a
Septim in the air and caught it as it fell back down towards me. “If I wanted to
be communing with crabs, I would have stayed at father’s fishery in Anvil.”
Elena shook her head at me and took the coin away from me. “Well that’s all
right then because _I_ will be the one talking, not you. Now get some decent
clothes on, she will be expecting our presence in the next hour or so.”

The stench was the first thing I noticed as we entered the district, a pungent
smell that could have rivalled the Waterfront. It was as if the Dreughs had not
bother read the advice given by Axius Tessus in his guidebook _A Thousand Ways
To Deal With Waste_. I could see what I assumed to be Dreugh children with
shovels gathering the droppings in the street, and taking them to a heap of the
dung that was half the size of one of those mushroom towers the Telvanni of
Vvardenfell used to grow before the Red Mountain erupted. I pinched my nose, and
Elena did the same. We watched as the Dreugh children set alight the mountain of
faeces, and they danced around it as if in some sort of trance.

The smell became almost deadly, so Elena pointed over to the building we were to
be expected in, and we ran over with books in hand, being careful not to step on
any stray pieces the Dreughs had missed. Elena banged on the wooden door
unceremoniously, and an elderly Dreugh opened it, peeking through the smallest
gap possible.

_“I told you before smooth-skin, those skooma-pipes were not mine. Now go away,
before I send Cossu and Vikxu out to gobble you all up.”_

“Madam, we are not at your door to enquire about skooma-pipes. My name is Elena
Alonius and this is Hron the Younger. We are here on behalf of the Imperial
Geographical Society.”

The Dreugh look us up and down. _“You are the ones Yuhxi-Noeht spoke of, no?”_
Elena nodded her head “Yes madam. The priest said you would be willing to
commune with us.”

The Dreugh laughed, with a raspy cough following it. _“ He did, did he?
Hmm……..very well kroki, you may enter. Move, Cossu, move!”_

The Dreugh opened the door, and the aroma inside was overwhelming. The stench of
faeces that had infiltrated our noses outside had been replaced with the sweet
smell of roses and scented candles. A pair of young pale Guars, who I assumed to
be Cossu and Vikxu, ran around the small shack, leapt onto a netch leather sofa
and promptly fell asleep.

The Dreugh lead us into the main room of the house, and stood with her back as
straight as she could in her old age. _“Yuhxi-Noeht said you wanted to learn
about the Cephalo, no?”_ Elena looked at me, making sure I was taking notes.
“Yes, we would very much like to learn about the Cephalo.” The Dreugh nodded.
_“Then you will follow the same customs that the Cephalo follow to one another.
De-robe.”_ I looked at Elena, looking to see if I had misheard. “I’m sorry?” _“I
said de-robe, young smooth-skin. You want to learn, you listen to mother
Seesu-Ke. De-robe!”_

I looked at Elena, unsure as to what to do. “I’m sorry, I’m not entirely
comfortable—” Sessu-Ke laughed with her raspy throat again. _“What’s wrong,
kroki? I’m sure your female friend here as seen much worse than a young, naked
smooth-skin before. Do it for Mother Sessu-Ke, if nothing else. It has been more
than a hundred of your years since I have seen a Cyrodiil’s stick, I do not want
to regret not asking.”_

I looked to my left at Elena again to have some guidance as to whether to obey
the Dreugh or not, but Elena was already naked from the waist up. “Wait a
minute, you’re doing as she—”

“Oh for the love of Dibella, Hron, just do as she says. I don’t want to go back
to the Society with no notes because you refused to get your kit off. Trust me
on this.”

At this point I had no idea whether I was dreaming, or I had in fact gone mad
from the aromatic fumes billowing around the room, but I gave into peer pressure
and followed the Dreugh’s request.

_“Ah kroki, you have such an impressive build for a Cyrodiil of such young age.
And you, krokei, have a bust a Cephalo could only dream of. You have made
Sessu-Ke warm inside. You may now sit.”_ Sessu-Ke pointed towards the sofa on
which Cossu and Vikxu were sleeping, and I sat down doing my best not to disturb
the Guars, as well as protect my “valuables” from the view of the perverted
Dreugh sat across from me.

“So, Mother Sessu-Ke. Shall we begin the interview now?”

_“Magis has only just risen in the sky, child. We will do the talking when Maasr
and Zekkun come to visit. This date wasn’t picked at random today, krokei.
Tonight shall be the most special night of the Cephalo year, maybe even for more
than just the Cephalo. You do not want to miss that. For now, Mother Sessu-Ke
will treat you to Ash-Goblin gammon and Eastern Kwama Eggs. Later you will get
to talk about the Cephalo with myself before the change.”_

Elena cocked her head to the side. “The change? What change?”

_“Not now, krokei, later. Wait until Maasr and Zekkun come. Come, follow me to
the kitchen, you can choose which steak you want.”_
