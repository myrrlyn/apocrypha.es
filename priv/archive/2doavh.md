I am a lover of spirits, a connoisseur of cocktails, a humble friar and man of
the world. I came of age on the streets of Wayrest, enraptured by the vibrant
tavern culture that reached out to an orphan like myself who wanted to be a man
before he knew what that meant; though I eventually cleaned myself up into a man
of the cloth, I never lost my love for the drinks that were to be found in such
gathering places, or rather the meaning of such libations. Drink is simply the
catalyst which moves men to share their joys and sorrows, the tavern or
cornerclub or mead hall the medium in which we come together. Men and elves have
many differences, but a good brew is blind to these things.
