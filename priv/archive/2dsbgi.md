## 3^rd^ Sun’s Dawn

Lideg,

I received the second wedding present early this morning, but why have you not
responded to my last two notes? Have you left me? This is the wedding. At
twilight, we will take the final steps to unite you and everyone else into
something greater. To bring our influence to that which requires it. Have you
not forgotten? Please reply to me.

Love,

Amaya

## 3^rd^ Sun’s Dawn, 4E 199

**Ascadian Isles Expedition, Vivec**

**Report 18.1: Location 5.1**

Approx. coordinates: 28672, -86016

Chambers: 5 (estimate, severe dilapidation)

Objects:

State: 1 not submersed/poor, 2 partially submersed/poor, 3 partially
submersed/dilapidated, 4 submersed/dilapidated, 5 submersed/dilapidated
(assumed)

Object 1: location 2, class container/wood, state poor/3 pieces, net lng. 2.98
ft., net wt. 70.03 lb., text false, portable false (heavy)

Object 2: location 2, class container/wood, state poor/5 pieces, net lng. 5.04
ft., net wt. 50.23 lb., text false, portable false (heavy)

Object 3: location 2, class NA, state NA, net lng. NA, net wt. NA, text NA,
portable NA

Notes: The chamber count is an estimate because what we assume to be the
lowermost chamber is completely blocked off, save one small section accessible
through a hole in the floor. Object 5.1.2.1 is a chest and object 5.1.2.2 is a
wardrobe. We concluded not to collect them due to danger from another object and
a lack of text or preservation. Object 5.1.2.3 is both the presence of and
remaining ectoplasm from an unidentified apparition, informally defined by a
crew member as “Ancestral Ghost.” Object 5.1.2.3 materialized when object
5.1.2.1 was opened.

_Signed,_

_Drusus Varo, Overseer of the Ascadian Isles Expedition_
