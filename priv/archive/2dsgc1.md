## On The Nature of Daemons and The Folly of Ignorance

### by the Alessian Arch-Curate of the Profane, Rimsin Tharn

The loss at Glenumbra Moors was a grim, sobering experience for our noble
Empire. On that day, our forces were crushed and driven home defeated. We
suffered further humiliation from the bull-men of Colovia during our long,
pitiful march home to Nibenay. To say the least, the loss came as a total
surprise. We did not expect to lose an inch of territory or influence in
Tamriel. We did not expect to lose so many brave fighting men and women. While
we took several of the heathens with us, notably Hoag Merkiller of Skyrim, the
losses were just too grim and our Empire has suffered.

Coming off the heels of such a humiliating and humbling defeat, it is only
natural that people ask questions. “Why did this happen? How could we have
possibly lost? Has the One forsaken us? Have we sinned? Were we not worthy of
victory”I have asked many of these questions myself over the past few years, and
I have heard them on the lips of fair citizens of Nibenay, from the lowliest
stable hand to the battlemages and priests.

There are many among the priesthood and military elite who have circulated
tracts denouncing the tactics of the late General Falchou, the legate in charge
of this operation. One particularly vile and venomous tract was authored by the
Inquisitor of One named Impermeable Micro Q in the odd style of the Canalus
cabal. I am of the opinion this man’s career and opinions are a farce and that
his zealotry and those who embody it led to the hubris that contributed to our
crushing defeat in the Direnni holdings. In his long, rambling, incoherent
manifesto he denounces the supposed heathenism of General Falchou, implying he
trafficked with “daemons” and was a heretic worthy of the death he received.

I intend to address and debunk such absurdly short-sighted opinions as these.
Nibenay always has been and always will be, after all, the cradle of Imperial
High Culture and the market place of ideas and open-mindedness. In the past the
Alessian priesthood has been tolerant and open to studies of a wide range of
subjects, including the Profane. My family has had a long and proud tradition of
studying the “daemons” the prophet Maruhk (may his coat shine healthily in
Aetherius) and others spoke of, and I have come to believe that it should not
only be permissible for a wise and learned magus or priest steeped in the faith
of the Empire to utilize such creatures and energies in our quest to bring
enlightenment to Tamriel, but that such study and utilization of extra-mundic
energy should be encouraged.

I can hear you now – angrily branding me a heretic or a daedra worshiper. I’ll
have you know, gentle reader, that I am no such thing. Please hear me out.
You’re all familiar with the Exlusionary Mandates, I’m sure. They’re read at the
Temple of the One and at your local chapels each Sundas, dutifully. Exclusionary
Mandate One states: _That the Supreme Spirit Akatosh is of unitary essence, as
proven by the monolinearity of Time._ Unitary essence, brothers and sisters. Do
not believe the Elven Lie that there is a distinction between so-called Aedra,
or between Aedra and Daedra. The Daemons that Maruhk spoke of are not the
denizens of Oblivion, but the malcontents and atheists who deny the power of
prayer itself. They have embraced the Elven Lie and believe in a plurality or
division of the One into pagan and heathenistic gods.

“But surely” my critics will argue “to incant abominations like Atronachs or
Clannfear in battle sullies the soul and invites darkness into one’s heart.”
I’ve heard it all before, often from the same hypocrites who are all too happy
to destroy our opponents with maces or swords, or to burn their camps with fire
either arcane or mundane. What’s the difference between killing a man with a
poison-tipped arrow or summoning a Clannfear to rip him limb from limb? The
important thing, dear brothers and sisters, is that the heretic dies. General
Falchou realized this better than anybody else.

Falchou was an honorable, upright man who does not deserve the attacks upon his
integrity that have been hurled at him since his demise. Even Emperor Gorieus
himself has denounced the good General as a heathen and a daemon worshiper, but
the One works in mysterious ways, and this so-called “curse of Hircine” was but
one of many gifts that Father Akatosh has deigned to share with his chosen
crusaders. We lack the divine horns of Morihaus and the killing light of
Pelinal’s hand, so we make do with what forces we can actually summon and
control to crush the heretics and erase the Elven Lie.

What better testament can there be to our godliness and purity of cause than the
blood and bones of our enemies, with which we can build a road to the future?
The opposite of love is not hate, good brothers and sisters. It is apathy. Do
not sit idly by and falsely presume that we can never recover from this setback.
By embracing all of the gifts of the One and not simply the narrow, dogmatic
teachings of the Arch-Primate and his Inquisitor we can spring back from this
loss. To deny the utility of the ancient arts of summoning and the reanimation
of fallen corpses is to quite frankly reject the gifts of Creation itself, and
that is the true heresy, brothers and sisters. Who is the real daemon in this
picture? Only the fool has said in his heart “The One loves me not.” or “I
reject the gifts of the One.” To accept the Elven Lie and to cut yourself off
from the divine gifts of Conjuration and Necromancy is to truly traffick with
the daemons who have filled your heads with ignorance and apathy.

Denounce me if you will, but my family is old and powerful. We have long served
the Empire, and always shall. We understand what it takes to get the good work
of the Lord done, and we shy not from controversy. They may excommunicate me or
even attempt to have me hanged, but my words shall endure. We may not banish the
wickedness of the Elven Taint from their hearts, good readers, but perhaps we
can see it within ourselves, and someday perhaps we can find a way to purify the
land itself of the taint. I make this pamphlet public, and accept what fate may
come. The One will watch over my soul – his faithful servant and yours, Rimsin
Tharn.
