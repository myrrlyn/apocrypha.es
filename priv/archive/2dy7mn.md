  Greetings scholars! In anticipation of an upcoming release, we wish to share
  with you this snippet of text, which delves into the mind of an Indoril noble.
  Neril Sevuro is the Grand Ascendant of House Indoril in the timeline of TES
  III: Morrowind.  He is old and frail, and often spends his time in isolation,
  almost never leaving his cloister in Almalexia. This text was written by
  gro-Dhal.

They ask me why I garden. “Muthsera”, they cry, “why do you hide from the world
in your tree-lined cloister? What of your duties to House and Hearth?” They do
not understand what it is to be a lord of the true nobility of Resdayn. Our duty
is to sharpen our minds and spirits, and to glean the determined workings of the
world so we can guide our children along the path of righteousness. It is in the
cultivation of my prayer garden that I find the wisdom for these tasks.

Observe the northern wall, along which I have planted sweetbarrels. The spines
of the young plants bring pain to the touch, and discourage close ministration.
With diligence and focused meditation however they can be made to bloom,
ugliness giving way to beauty and the diaphanous, out-of-body visions of the
sweetpulp vapors. This is the progression of the spiritual self: from resistance
to blossoming to the numinous.

On the southern wall opposite are a bed of timsa flowers. Saint
Timsa-of-the-Long-Hours happens to be an ancestor of mine, and the flowers first
emerged from her body as she lay broken at the feet of Molag Bal’s magi. These
flowers blossom in sun, rain and ashfall and illuminate the virtue of
resistance, and the futility of profane sorcery against faith.

On the western wall, facing the sunrise, is a cluster of bright fireferns-
difficult to cultivate in heartland soil. I use a little of the ash from my
hearthfire as fertilizer. The ash contains a trace of my House’s holy offerings.
This token of faith is sufficient to bring forth these plants from ground which
does not welcome them, and once they have taken root they will endure forever.
This is how the laws of the gods, properly interpreted, create citizens of the
highest caliber who will never stray from the proper course once they are shown
the way.

On the eastern wall, facing the sunset, are rows of noble sedge. These plants
are my pride and joy, because they are grown from cuttings rather than seeds.
These particular flowers are in essence parts of one flower that has lived since
the middle of the Second Era. They represent continuity and careful planning,
and give me faith that eternal vigilance and care can engender eternal harmony.

In the center of my garden is a stone, upon which I sit in contemplation and
occasionally carve my insights. This stone is to be my legacy, alongside my
military victories and descendents. Like the garden, if properly tended with
wisdom and reverence to the past, it will provide enlightenment to my successors
for generations to come.

They ask me why I garden. I say I am a lord of the House Indoril, and my garden
is a world and the world is my garden. This is our birthright and our burden.
