House Mothril of Leyawiin, Altmeri by race, comprises one of the most wealthy
and powerful families of Southern Nibenay. Yet their wealth lies not in their
possession of great estates, as does the wealth of many other families of
Cyrodiil, but in their trade capacity and their pragmatism and adaptability,
traits which are paramount to the continuation of Nibenese Civilization and to
the Empire. The Mothrils, in their time ruling Leyawiin, their seat of many
years, have proven themselves Mer of the Sea and their naval strength, though it
has waxed and waned at varying times, has generally been great indeed. They can
put to sea over two hundred warships and they possess three times as many
trading cogs. Their naval strength has also proven integral in a number of
engagements, including the Thalmor assault on the Imperial City and the war with
the Camoran Usurper.

The Mothrils trace their history back to two points of origin. First, is the
Ayleids of Cyrodiil, where it is maintained that the progenitors of their clan
joined Alessia’s rebellion. But the house also maintains histories which claim
that the name of Mothril first emerges as a naval family from Auridon,
eventually becoming warlords in service to the Direnni, which was a role they
served loyally in for a considerable time. However, by the time of the Battle at
Glenumbra, this relationship had evidently soured. Accounts of the Battle of
Glenumbra Moors are notoriously unreliable, but what seems evident is that
despite the Direnni Victory, the Mothrils came to some form of accord with the
Alessians, arriving late to the battle. Consequently, the Alessians bled the
Direnni savagely before their eventual defeat, leaving House Mothril in a
position of strength, vis a vis their erstwhile overlords. When the Direnni
began collapsing, rather than reinforce the falling Elven rule in High Rock, the
Mothril Clan marched through the Reach to Cyrodiil, where they were given lands
on the Panther River, not far, it seems, from Nenalata, the alleged last kingdom
of the Ayleids. It is highly likely that many of those Ayleids remaining at
Nenalata that did not subsequently depart to Valenwood joined the Mothril
family. Since the Mothril family possessed a large number of Ayleid Era
artifacts, it is widely held that the Mothrils, of all the Nibenese families,
maintain the purest and strongest line of descent from Alessias Ayleid allies.
House Mothril have enjoyed touting this heritage as a weapon against the power
and boasts of rival noble families of Nibenay.

Despite this bloodline, the Mothrils have never been a house given unto
foolishness and have never aspired to the resurrection of the Ayleid Empire.
They assimilated into Nibenese society in every way, lending advice and arcane
knowledge to the Nibenese Aristocracy, presenting themselves as loyal servants
of the Empire. Moreover, they became noted patrons of the Imperial Cult, with
one member of the family, Bartimus Mothril, becoming the Living Saint of
Zenithar. Saint Bartimus was a notable resident of Leyawiin throughout the
Second Era, becoming known as Saint Bartimus of the Barrel, for his habit of
residing in a cargo barrel on the street. He was tragically killed when his home
was thrown into Leyawiin harbor with the saint inside. The pragmatic
assimilation into Nibenese society of the Mothrils served the family well, and
they survive to this day, in part because of it.

When the Nibenese, desperate for a Port with which they could build ships to
push back at the irresistible Colovian Fleet, decided to conquer and settle the
Blackwood. The Mothrils, whether wanting to avoid falling under the gaze of
Alessian xenophobia, desirous of conquest, or simply desperate to make a name
for themselves, were, according to the tale, the only family which came forward
to lead the proposed expedition. Though in possession of small numbers of Altmer
and Ayleid troops, the campaign was a remarkable success for House Mothril, who
were commanded by a knight of superlative skill named Leyan Mothril. Leyan
smashed through the Trans-Niben and the Blackwood, defeating an Anequinan army,
and finally pressing the borders of Cyrodiil to the Topal Bay, at the top of
which, on the mouth of the Niben, they founded Port Leyan by Anequina, which was
soon shortened to Leyawiin. Allegedly, this founding was marked by a battle
between Leyan and her nemesis, an avatar of Hircine in the form of a Swamp
Leviathan named Jormungandr.

While this conquest gave the Mothrils a seat of considerable import within
Cyrodiil, which served to make them very wealthy, very fast, it was distant
enough and deep enough in the wilderness from the Imperial City to give them
breathing room from the harsh and xenophobic rule of the Alessian Order,
allowing them to remain a potent dynasty within the new order of human, Nibenean
rule. Also accounting for their remaining in prominence, was the fact that the
Mothril family utilized the substantial fleets they quickly constructed to scour
the Black Marsh pirates from the face of Tamriel; these were the same pirates
that had been the scourge of the Alessian Empire for so long. It was Melegant
Mothril who led his navy into the depths of the Black Marsh and brought fire and
steel to every single pirate lair he encountered; some Saxhleel historians of
Black Marsh have alleged that these pirate hunting expeditions resulted in many
Argonian deaths, something contested by the nobles of Leyawiin.

Leyawiin, which grew quickly into a prosperous, though chaotic and eclectic
city, also put the Mothrils in an excellent position once the war of
Righteousness arrived, and they promptly declared against the Alessians, playing
their own part in the liberation of Cyrodiil, something which the family takes
no small pride in. The Mothril fleet was the principal naval force blockading
the Imperial City when the Alessians finally collapsed under pressure from their
many enemies. After this, the house began to expand, using its great naval
strength to muscle in on the southern trade lanes, and strike fear by staging
reaving expeditions against its enemies; making more than one successful raid on
Auridon, and even as far east as the Black Harbor of Esrionet. Despite the far
reaching Leyawiin fleets, no greater rival to Leyawiin’s prosperity existed than
Senchal, which sat right across the Topal Bay. More than one trade war was
viciously played out on the waters of the bay between the kings of Senchal and
the Mothrils.

After centuries of prosperous rule over Leyawiin as an independent trade city,
or as a loosely integrated part of the Nibenese realms, the family’s fortunes
reached their Nadir in the later Second Era, when a destructive, protracted war
with the Khajit began. Having lost the entire trans-Niben to Elsweyr, more than
once, the family was besieged in Leyawiin itself and driven out, only to return
later, but diminished. Finally, in 2E 801, they were driven out of Leyawiin by
the Khajit entirely, and fled to Bravil. When Tiber Septim began unifying the
province, House Mothril immediately sided with the rising warlord and used their
much reduced fleet to besiege the city Leyawiin with Septim’s help. However, the
Mothrils, despite their lofty status and despite retaining a seat on the Elder
Council, were only accorded the status of Hereditary Stewards of Leyawiin, and
even this was a position they did not always maintain. Tiber Septim preferred to
entrust Leyawiin to one of his commanders, the Colovian, Leon Caro.

The Third Era was a time of recovery and opportunity, and though the threat from
Elsweyr was subsided, it was not always an easy period for the Mothrils. Much of
the house’s growth came from their participating in the development and
expansion of the Imperial Navy, of which the house remains a patron to this day.
Cyrodiil, despite being the Imperial Province, was not always a realm of peace
and good order. For much of this time it was rent by dynastic warfare amongst
the Septim line, which the Mothrils were forced to weather along with the rest
of Cyrodiil’s nobility. When the Camoran Usurper rampaged through Colovia,
Hammerfell and finally into High Rock, Antiochus Mothril organized the majority
of the Cyrodiilic contribution to the victorious fleet commanded by Othrok of
Dwynnen. However, though Antiochus was accorded the highest honors within the
Order of the Dragon, he died (somewhat suspiciously) shortly after the battle,
and his lieutenant Fasil Umbranox remarkably went on to be named Lord of Anvil.
The war with the Camoran Usurper led to the Mothrils gaining the hereditary
title of _“Navarch of Nibenay”_, though Leyawiin remained under the rule of the
Caro Family.

However, by the Fourth Era, the Mothrils had regained much of their power and
influence, intermarrying more than once with the Caro family, regaining their
positions of Stewards of Leyawiin after decisive campaigns against the Renjira
Krin and regaining a powerful naval and mercantile position within the power
structure of Nibenay. They also utilized their trading power effectively in the
East Empire Company’s more recent dealings with the Ebony Trade in Morrowind.
House Mothril continues to play an integral part in the deliberation of the
Elder Council in governing the sacred empire, in the upkeep of the Imperial Navy
and as a notable collaborator of the East Empire Company. Like many of the great
families of Nibenay, the Mothrils fought with distinction during the Great War,
working to preserve the rule of this august empire.

Further notables within the family include more than just Leyan Mothril, the
semi-mythic heroine who founded Leyawiin. Others include Maxentius Mothril, who
was a noted warrior in Marius Caro’s wars in Black Marsh, Corlys Mothril, who
was Chancellor for nearly two centuries under the Potentate Versidue-Shaie and
finally Admiral Demetrius Mothril, who commanded the Imperial Niben Fleet and
led the doomed naval defense of the Imperial City during its sack.
