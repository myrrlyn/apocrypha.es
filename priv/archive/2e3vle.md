Laboratory-based work #3

Enscribing the Lightsphere spellscroll

## Objectives of the work

- to solidify previous praxography knowledge;
- to digest the technology of spellscroll enscribing;
- to master the skills necessary for enscribing 1-st tier spellscrolls.

## Requisite

- Praxography altair;
- Magickally imbued parchment;
- Set of class-Ngth inks;
- Reference material;
- Dracometer;
- Terrameter;
- Kaleidometer.

## Course of work

- Prepare the requisite;
- Calculate the seals required for the spellscroll;
- Enscribe the scroll;
- Show the scroll to the master-magus to fold it;
- Test the scroll;
- Measure the showings;
- Write an account.

1. After coming to the praxography altair check it in accordance to the safety
   arrangements. Look for the inconsistencies, check the protection circles. The
   work with the defective altair or without the protection circle is
   prohibited. Attune the scribing crystal and put the pencils at the starting
   position. Place and anchor the parchment on the altair. Note, that tassel
   should be at the left side of the altair.

2. Apply the Galerion Transform to the Lightsphere spell-pattern. If you don’t
   know it, find it in the Appendix 7. Then comapare the results with the
   Lanarill Chart. As seen on the picture below in the end you should get
   pattern simplified down to 3 tier-3 and 1 tier-2 seals. Decide the
   parameters: first seal is in charge of size of sphere and time of existence,
   second - time of existence, third - brightness, fourth - size and placing.
   Pick the required inks from set and pour them into ink-acceptors above the
   pencils. Create the link with the crystal and begin to dreamcasting the seals
   in the order from first to the last. Scrolls unfold from the tassel, so first
   seal should be written on the left side. It’s recommended to do all of the
   seals through the chanting, however the usage of gestures is completely
   valid.

3. Ask Observing Master to check your work. If everything is done well, Master
   will fold the scroll. Look at his actions. Scroll folding will be covered at
   the next laboratory-based work. Remember, only the requisite for the first
   attempt is provided by house. If there’re any mistakes, student have to buy
   additional requisite with his own money.

4. Move to the test area. Prepare the measuring equipment. Use the scroll and
   measure the time of Lightsphere existence, its size, height over you, level
   of kaleidokules’ emanation and side-effect of emanating the phlogiston.

5. Put the measured data into the acconut chart.
