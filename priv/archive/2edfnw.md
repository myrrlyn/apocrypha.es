## Introduction

As citizens of Tamriel, will never forget the 4th of Sun’s Dawn, 4E 5. This day
marks the beginning of Red year and the Dark Age of Morrowind. The land burned
and ash filled the sky, leading to a great exodus from the Eastern province. The
Dunmer people are still mending Red Year’s devastation today: climate changes
call for complete agricultural reform, the Great Houses are on the verge of a
civil war, and the increased population from Dunmer-Imperials and Dunmer of
Skyrim returning to Morrowind has led to an economic crisis. There is no time
for the arts.

To say that the arts never flourished in Morrowind is to make an ignorant
assumption. Red Mountain destroyed the gems of Dunmeri society; this almost
completely removed the historical evidence of pre-Red Year Dunmeri culture. This
does not mean that this culture never existed. Though remnants of Old Morrowind
are limited, they are more than enough to reveal a wonderfully unique set of
customs, traditions, and arts. To quote Constans Varo of the Tamrielic
University of Cyrodiil: “Beneath the layer of ash lies a cultural treasure.”

This report is an overview of the history of Chimeri/Dunmeri theater (Dunmeri
theater for brevity), beginning approximately in the Late Middle Merethic Era
and ending at the dawn of the 4th Era. Dunmeri cultural history is generally
divided into three broad periods: The High Velothi Period (also known as the
Post-Exodus), the Indoril Period (also known as the Gilded Age), and the
Tamrielic Period (also known as the Reformation).

## Velothi Period

The birth of the Chimer race marked the beginning of the High Velothi Period
(Velothi period for brevity). Velothi theater itself has much earlier origins
among the dissident Aldmeri tribes. This makes Velothi theater very similar to
Aldmeri theater. However, the dissidents primarily used their own form of
mime-dance as a means to culturally defy the Aldmer, who used strict stage
rules. The manner of defiance began subtly, but the differences between Aldmeri
and dissident theatrical techniques increased over time. With the Exodus from
the Summerset Isles, Velothi theater was dubbed its own art form.

Early Aldmeri theater was, by definition, dance. Dance was considered a sacred
practice. Dances were performed at special events such as religious holidays and
coronations. The Aldmer viewed dance as a social responsibility rather than an
art or pastime; all classes of people were required to learn dance when they
came of age. Nobility had special tutors while commoners learned from
experienced family members. Men and women learned the same movements, but were
completely isolated in their dance lessons, and during performances, eye contact
was the only form of contact allowed between the sexes. When an Aldmer grew to
an old age, he or she would retire from dance. Both the beginning and the ending
of dance lessons were very important life events. The Aldmer celebrated both
extensively.

Stylistically, Aldmeri dance was characterized by uniformity, complex
formations, and discipline. At the time, the Aldmer defined choreography as a
visual art because the pictures that the formations made were much more
important than the people. For this reason, Aldmeri dance was traditionally
viewed from above to see the entire formation. We know this from engravings
discovered in the Summerset Isles, showing pictograms and arrows winding across
the slab of stone. Some of these engravings have been found in Resdayn (modern
Morrowind); these have daedric letters instead of pictograms. This form of dance
notation is now called Som-Res notation, and rumors suggest that families of
Ashlander descent still know this ancient art. ^\* The most important rule of
dance was to maintain a personal space of at least one foot at all times. None
of the rules of dance were laws, so a collision was not punishable as a criminal
offense, but it was reprimanded as such.

The dissidents recognized dance as a vital aspect of Aldmeri culture and sought
to defy its rules. The first dissident movement involved dancing without
permission. Dissidents formed groups to dance in public areas on non-holidays.
This alone was received as a great offense, even without breaking any stylistic
rules. A few years later, a dissident (whose name is lost, but later accounts
imply that he was Saint Veloth himself) choreographed a dance involving a line
of people who were each a few inches apart. This was received with violence, and
though none were killed several were injured.

With the Chimer-Aldmer schism, the new race developed a new form of theatrical
dance. This is what we now refer to as High Velothi theater. Velothi theater
kept many of the qualities of Aldmeri theatrical dance, but became a much more
passionate and personal art form, as well as closer to mime. Following the
Exodus, the Velothi used theater solely in reverence to the Daedra. Groups of
Chimer performed abstract mime sequences for Temple services. The gender and age
restrictions were loosened and every Velothi Temple offered theatrical lessons
to the public. Theater was still considered sacred, but it was much more
accessible.

Daedric armor and weapons originate from High Velothi theater. The Chimer used
masks to represent the Good Daedra in their performances. These were called
guisemasks. The first discovered artifact made of Daedric metal was the
Guisemask of Boethiah. It is a heavy, ornately carved mask with curved tusks and
horns, and its jaw extends past the wearer’s navel. Some Merethic Era myths
suggest that Daedric metal was Boethiah’s gift to the Velothi, or even that
Boethiah was the one to give the Chimer their own form of dance. Myths from the
same year state that Boethiah’s title “Prince of Plots” refers not only to
conspiracy, but to the map-like formations that remained a characteristic of
Velothi theater after the Chimer-Aldmer schism.

Centuries later, the Chimer were to use guisemasks to frighten Nordic soldiers,
leading to the method of coupling Daedric metals with unique enchantments in
order to lessen the weight. This practice evolved into the construction of
Daedric armor; Daedric weapons are the newest of these creations. Guisemasks
were also fashioned for the Tribunal (Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil) to honor
their respective Anticipations.
