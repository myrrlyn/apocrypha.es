  Hi all, this is just some art history speculation. While some parts were
  inspired by the games (mostly TES III of course), some were inspired entirely
  by real life cultural history and have no presence in games or other lore
  (cough cough Helas Stars cough). Interpret as you see fit. The third and final
  chapter will be posted tomorrow.

Contradictory to the name, the Indoril Period began with the death of Hortator
Indoril Nerevar and the end of the War of the First Council. The period is named
as such because the arts flourished especially in Indoril districts (namely the
city of Almalexia, Mournhold District in particular). Besides their religious
authority, Triunes Almalexia and Vivec both had a strong influence in the
artistic culture of the Indoril Period, which is why the era is also referred to
as the “Gilded Age,” a reference to the “golden age” of the Tribunal. During
this time, artistic interest drew out towards mainland capitals and away from
the island of Vvardenfell.

The rise of the Great Houses brought a clear distinction between Dunmeri and
Ashlander theater, as the Ashlanders chose to reject the theatrical evolution of
the Indoril period. Their original aim was to uphold Velothi tradition. However,
Ashlander theater underwent its own evolution. Set and story were never
introduced, but the art form became much more athletic as they utilized a
greater range of motion and fast pace. Rhythm became essential; dances were
always performed to the beat of a single drum. The drummer was always the
Ashkhan (the leader of the tribe). The only one not to participate was the wise
woman. This form of dance was to be re-adopted into Dunmeri culture centuries
later, to become what we now know as Resdaynian folk dance.

For the Great Houses, the minimalism of High Velothi theater died away during
the Indoril period-- beautifully designed sets, props, and costumes became an
integral part of Dunmeri theater. A playwright was expected to utilize every
part of the stage to create the finest spectacle possible. It was common to
include one moment of stillness to showcase the tableau the playwright was most
proud of. Music was introduced to the theater during the Indoril period.

Acting of the Indoril Period is defined by elitism and visual aesthetics.
Theater was used to display a person’s social status, and every element of the
stage mattered. In technique, Indoril theater relied heavily on gestures of the
arms, hands, and head. Though it was essential to keep these gestures refined,
hand-to-hand contact was permitted, as well as interactions between men and
women.

One huge advancement was the use of story. Symbolism gave way to more literal
expression. Eventually the guisemasks were removed and the art facial emotions
was introduced to Dunmeri theater. The actors were still silent, but spelled
dialogue with their hands through a practice known as “speaksigns”. These
involved a particular hand gesture or shape for each letter of the Daedric
alphabet. Some letters involved one hand, some two. The dialogue was never
complicated due to grammatical and time limitations, but it was still a
revolutionary idea. Speaksigns are still used today in the most formal of
Dunmeri Temple services, as a form of silent communication. Other cultures are
beginning to adopt speaksigns, especially with the recent movement of using
universal Tamrielic speaksigns in Cyrodiil.

Another important movement was the adaption of non-theatrical texts into plays.
The popularization of this practice began in the Tamrielic Period, but Indoril
culture laid the groundwork. Vivec and Almalexia were the greatest influences
for this movement. Though Vivec made his home outside the mainland, he
encouraged nationwide artistic adaptations of his writing. In this way he is
responsible for the idea of putting written work onstage.

However, Almalexia took the most interest in the performing arts. She supported
actors and playwrights by funding the construction of several acting centers in
Mournhold. These became the first auditoria. Designated buildings for performing
arts had not existed before, yet they became tremendously popular. Auditoria
were also used as places of residence for artists and actors. This lead to the
formation of large theater companies. The Godsreach Auditorium is the most
famous auditorium, commissioned by the Tribunal and reserved to the High
Ordinators, who were required to learn acting and playwriting.

Most actors were Indoril nobles who performed to win the esteem of the Temple,
the High Archcanon, and even Almalexia herself. A good performance would be well
rewarded. These rewards ranged from money and jewelry to a higher political
position. Mehra Helas, an adept of Mournhold’s Temple, was known to reward
actors with curious star-shaped gems. Historians dubbed these as Helas Stars.
Primary sources suggest that the stars had healing properties, existed in
several colors, and that six stars were given out. Only the blue star and the
green star have been found, but each is priceless. These two Helas Stars are on
display in the Tamrielic Museum of Cyrodiil.

Despite its skyrocketing popularity, theater was still exclusively religious. A
typical play adaption would depict a traditional fable or fairy tale. The most
popular of these is the Homilies of Blessed Almalexia, though historians dispute
whether the Homilies were truly adaptations, or if Almalexia originally wrote
them for the theater. The Homilies were a group of children’s fables, often
performed collectively. Sometimes smaller excerpts were performed. The Homilies
are some of the only Indoril works to include Triunes Vivec and Sotha Sil. This
is because artistic depictions of the Tribunal were viewed in poor taste.
Naturally, Almalexia’s own writing was an exception. Still, the Homilies were
performed with no actors for Vivec and Sotha Sil. When the other actors were to
interact with one of the living gods, they would address a blank space while a
narrator described the dialogue in speaksigns. Despite this, the Homilies of
Blessed Almalexia was the greatest success of Indoril playwriting.

One playwright (whose name has been expunged from all archives) courageously
endeavored to adapt the 36 Sermons of Vivec for the stage. This was poorly
received and nobody has attempted this again. Critics argued that the Sermons
were not meant for live performance and that the effect was “profane.”

Even the folklore which preceded ALMSIVI was altered into Tribunalist
propaganda. This is not to be interpreted negatively—the aim was not to convert,
but to celebrate Tribunal worship among believers. Indoril actors and
playwrights took their stories for granted. Instead, they devoted their artistic
talents to creating a beautiful vignette onstage. Today we reflect on the
Indoril Period as the height of Dunmeri theatrical accomplishment.
