Dear Yneslian Brethren,

Our race never was great believers in the Tamrielic Empire, but even we could
not have predicted it’s downfall. Yes, I shall repeat that word: downfall. The
Septim Dynasty of Tamriel is no more and with it a new era has been declared. Of
course, this information hasn’t been released to the Imperial territories due to
how we already have a tenuous relationship with the Tamrielics as it is. ‘The
island natives might stage a revolt!’ they yell at the top of their lungs in the
council chamber. Pfft, sometimes it is hard to remember that we as a race are
younger than these foreigner fools.

Nevertheless, I believe that our Council needs to know exactly how events
conspired in Tamriel and how the bloodline of the Emperors ended. In fact, this
event can easily be linked to the previous letters I have sent in the last
decade or so.

Do you remember the Imperial Simulacrum of 3E 389? It began when Jagar Tharn,
Imperial Battlemage to Emperor Uriel Septim VII, betrayed his lord by sending
him into one of the Nineteen Voids – the Deadlands – of Oblivion. Tharn did took
on his guise and ruled the Empire for ten years until the hero known as the
Eternal Champion destroyed him. Inter-Provincial Wars were waged under his reign
as old hatreds were reignited, even in the Imperial territories. These were not
coincidences! Jagar Tharn was a chief member of an organization known as the
Mythic Dawn, worshippers (the fools) of MEHAGON, who the Tamrielics call
Mehrunes Dagon. As we Echmer know, MEHAGON is obsessed with destroying Nirn.
This is due to a metamorphosis event unique to this kalpic lifecycle, as he was
responsible for many of the concepts existing in our world from previous
existences. To destroy us is to recreate himself.

The tool used to send the Emperor to the Deadlands was the Staff of Chaos, a
mystical item tied directly to the land itself. It is so powerful because it
draws power directly from this land’s Stones, weakening the Towers they upheld.
This is a conspiracy stretching back to the Middle Dawn. The Dagonites (Mythic
Dawn) successfully infected the aurbical structure with a deadly virus. The
scattering and re-gathering of the Staff was a trap of MEHAGON that the
Tamrielic fools fell prey to.

Next was the reassembling of the Anumidium, whose Tower-hood is to negate all
else until nothing remains. The Dagonites wished to use it to further the goal
of their master, but they did not anticipate TOSH fracturing upon his activation
(is it coincidence that the brass atronach powered by the soul of his dead twin
breaks him every time it breathes life?). Anumidium was cast outside of time,
but it is not gone and will eventually return. No good came out of the Warp in
the West.

Events in the province of Morrowind only further made way for MEHAGON’s invasion
of Tamriel. With Red Mountain – the second-strongest Tower – destabilized
completely and the Heart of ALORKH banished from Tamriel (read: not Nirn) the
aurbical-web was now weak enough for MEHAGON to pierce through the veil.
Dagonites manipulated the events between ALMSIVI and the Nerevarine, and
expertly at that.

With Walk-Brass and Red-Tower out of commission and the Staff of Chaos leeching
power from the rest while it remained hidden underneath the White-Gold Tower
(our Ayleid cousins did this on purpose to regain dominance, but were too hasty
in their folly), the Dagonites were able to open up the Oblivion Gates across
Tamriel to destroy the remaining Towers (by doing this MEHAGON would be able to
destroy all of Nirn without opposition). Some even opened on our island, but we
were able to hold our own even we lost much in the process.

The reason why the Mythic Dawn assassinated the Emperor wasn’t to deactivate the
Dragonfires, it was to get at the Amulet of Kings. If he was able to destroy the
Stone of White-Gold than he would be able to rip his way into Mundus in his true
form without restriction. But he wasn’t (in fact, none of us) expected Uriel of
having an illegitimate son or the intervention of the hero known as the Hero of
Kvatch. The destruction of White-Gold wasn’t able to happen as quickly as
MEHAGON wanted it too, and it almost seemed that young Martin Septim would be
able to negate the ATEDA’s intentions.

So MEHAGON focused his forces on finding and destroying the Towers of the other
provinces in order to succeed, but met heavy resistance. The Argonians of Black
Marsh (whose Tower is unknown to me) completely devastated his forces. The Men
of Skyrim were able to drive the Lesser ATEDA back, but lost many cities in the
attempt. And Valenwood, High Rock, and Elsweyr fought furiously. But the
Summerset Isles fell against the rush of MEHAGON’s forces (who realized that
they weren’t able to defeat the other provinces, so united in this massive
attack) and destroyed the Crystal Tower. Shocking, I know.

With this act, MEHAGON could now enter Mundus without proper ritualization. But
by this time Martin and the Hero of Kvatch had already made it to the Imperial
City to relight the Dragonfires. In order to stop them, MEHAGON walked through
the waters to wreak havoc. With him being here, the traditional barriers between
planes was broken in its entirety. Martin had an idea, however; by smashing the
Amulet of Kings in the Temple of the One the dragon souls contained within fused
with his own and he became a manifestation of TOSH. This manifestation fought
against MEHAGON and banished him from Mundus, before transforming into stone
statue that still stands in the ruined Temple. And with that, the Oblivion
Crisis ended.

Unbeknownst to the ruined Empire, however, what happened in the Temple of the
One was a mistake. By sealing the barriers between Mundus and Oblivion, the Last
Septim deactivated the most powerful Tower. The Aurbis is now at its absolute
weakest in the first time in millennia.

This was the hidden plot of MEHAGON and it was truly magnificent. I hope this is
beneficial to all of the researchers at home, my Council.

Forever Yours,

Sirius

Dear Consul,

The information you have presented to us is both disturbing and enlightening.
Thankfully, we were able to protect the Pleonastic Spire from the invading
Lesser ATEDA and halt MEHAGON’s plot. While our kind holds no true attachment to
the Aurbis, to come to an end such as that one would have been undeniably
degrading. MEHAGON is, with all due respect to the ATEDA, a bumbling idiot with
somewhat good intentions who is easy to manipulate.

We hope that High Chancellor Ocato (or is he Potentate Ocato, now that the
Septims have been effectively wiped out?) is able to hold the Empire together in
these trouble times. Hopefully your guidance will be beneficial to him, along
with the other members of the Elder Council.

Something that still troubles is however…are all the Dagonites gone? The fact
that Gates were able to open on Yneslea tells us that some of these cultists
were able to infiltrate our home. We will have to lead excursions into the
cities to uncover any remaining Mythic Dawn and execute them for crimes against
our government.

Nevertheless, please keep us informed of more events that reveal themselves in
the future as you always have.

Yours Forever,

The Council of Dull Chimes
