There was a City. A City of vacant streets. Its outline alone was visible,
engulfed as the City was in a thick and seemingly impenetrable fog. Light did
not stray far from its beacons, for they stood divided from one another;
scattered throughout the streets, and hidden within the windowless spires. A
soundless lightning alone stirred the composition. »A comforting yet treatorous
valley; hiding all but the very apex of the storm«, remarked Aem, gazing down
from atop the Tower of Ae. »But I fear no storm, and my spires shall know no
fear either. A spireless moor I would dream of, vacant and unwilling, barren and
unwanting, fearless and empty. A moor I dream, a moor for Aem.« A moor it was.
An endless moor of one. With ageless trees bending to a timeless wind. »A moor I
see, a moor for Aem«. Yet in The Moor of Ae, the fog still rolled. Still it
engulfed all in front and all behind. »Open and barren, eternal yet almost
invisible, it was hidden from Aem.« Aem now at last knew of the fog. Aem the
wanderer, Aem of the Now. Aem who fell in Love within the moor, as he knew for
the first time what before he merely suspected; the outline of his always-new
Moor of Ae.

Aem first knew Love for Aem. From that moment of First Falling, he knew that he
was made lasting, for he knew of not to last. Aem dreamt of the fog now. Of the
mistery, and of the secret mother of his dream. »Wander I do, yet the fog does
not consume me.” Aem in the fog, Aem the Lasting. “Do I dare stand again
unmoving? I shall dare to search the fog of Ae. I shall do so from within this
Moor of Ae«. And for the first time, the fog of Ae alone was seen. No longer was
it a defining barrier, but a mother to Aem and the moor. Mother, Stranger,
daughter; Ae all. So Aem knew what the fog was, and his wandering would be no
more. The Moor of Ae was no more. The Wheel was no more. The Tower was no more.
Now there was only Ae. Ae all Aem. Aem Anew.
