## Introduction

The Anuielectorate has, on the date date of Tirdas, second of Hearthfire,
formally sanctioned the creation of the Dominion Solar Vault Facility. The
purpose of this document is therefore threefold. Firstly, it is to be a charter
outlining the goals of the Solar Vault Facility and what steps will be taken to
reach them. Secondly, it will provide an overview of the various operations we
intend to start immediately on the opening of the facility. Thirdly, it will
serve as a reminder of the reasoning behind this decision should any objection
arise from the Anuielectorate in the future.

## I. On The Goals and Missions of the Solar Vault Facility

The Solar Vault Facility’s central goal is to research and create a means for
the Altmer to escape the Material Prison once and for all. To this end, we shall
employ a broad variety of specialists including metaphysical engineers, mages of
the highest caliber, Mirror Logicians, and of course agents trained in counter
espionage, espionage, and assassination.

The Facility is designed with several state of the art laboratories designed for
magical research of any sort, including volatile subjects such as Metaphysical
Displacement and Tonal Architecture. As an extension of this, it can also serve
as a prison and vault to contain a variety of specimens and artifacts that may
be dangerous. There will also be specialized facilities designed for the
production of Tower Scrolls by any means necessary.

Primary communications shall be over memospore to prevent leakage of classified
information. The first and greatest defence of this facility is the fact that it
does not exist. We have hidden it from Hermaeus Mora himself. Any unauthorized
reader of this document shall be immediately terminated. Any Anuielectorate
member discovered breaking secrecy shall be immediately terminated. Etc.

## II. An Overview of The Operations To Begin Immediately

We do not wish to waste time after the opening. As we already have the skills
and several artifacts we need to begin, we will immediately start several
operations.

OPERATION AMNESIA: We have hired the foremost experts in the field of Mnemonic
Sorcery to research the possibility of erasing Mankind from Memory. It is our
hope that TAL(OS) will be weakened by this enough for us to move forward with
our other projects.

OPERATION AURIMAG: After the incident with the rogue operative Ancano, one of
our agents within the Psijic Order managed to successfully spirit away the Eye
of Magnus. The implications of this statement are obvious. History has shown
what can be done with the organs of the et’Ada through the endeavors of Vivec
and the Dwemer. A variety of projects have been proposed, but the most promising
of these is Aurimag.

Some background is required to understand. The Mirror Logicians inform us that
the threat of the Numidium grows greater every day. The PSJJ champion would no
doubt erase us in a Doom-Drum beat should it return. Therefore, it has been
proposed that we create a golem of our own as a champion of the Dominion. The
cyclop creature will be powered by the Eye of Magnus. Leading theory suggests
that an effective counter against the Numidium’s reductionist power would be the
ability of infinite creation, which would well be within the power of such a
being. It may also serve as a viable replacement for Crystal-Like-Law in terms
of apotheosis, as well as an excellent weapon.

This project has unfortunately been stalled by the absence of the Staff of
Magnus. It would be dangerous to create such a being without any control over
it, so it must wait until our operatives have completed their search. In the
meantime, the Eye will serve as a power source for the facility.

OPERATION SILENT SOUND: Some of our most ancient texts reveal the abilities and
characteristic of the early Aldmer. These have been hidden to prevent any
information leaking to the Empire, but the sources exist nonetheless. Historical
research indicates that the Aldmer were able to communicate telepathically as an
inherent ability. We hope to regain this ability by whatever means are
necessary. Leading theory suggests several possibilities, including Nymic
Entanglement and Memospore-AE Transfusion. The risks are high, so we will
attempt it with Bosmer traitors first to check whether this results in hivemind
behavior. If so, it may serve as a viable means of controlling the population.

These are the opening operations we will perform. Several others are already in
the works, but in the interest of space we will leave them for other documents.

## III. The Reason For The Solar Vault Facility

As you in the Anuielectorate know, the Merish races are facing more trials than
ever before. The Third Era was a disaster, and the majority was the Temporal
Myth’s fault. The Oblivion Crisis destroyed Crystal-Like-Law. Thousands of years
of tradition, lost in a single moment.

Men have ruled over Mer for too long. PSJJ has corrupted the Dunmer. The Bosmer
hide in their trees, and the Khajiit are too busy being high on the Deceiver’s
corpse to notice anything. It is our responsibility to set things right.

We are descended from the Spirits, and so shall we ascend to the heavens again.
That is why the Solar Vault exist. For a little while longer, we will hide. We
will bide our time and collect our power. Then, we will be taken away in the
arms of Auriel, never to feel the sufferings of mortality again. Think on these
things before you question this program.

## Conclusion

The Solar Vault Facility will be the fortress of the true Mer. Our goals are not
merely abstract, but concrete and achievable. We have already prepared
operations for this purpose. The Thalmor are ascendant.
