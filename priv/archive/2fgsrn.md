…and as the ninth shout was heard from the lungs of the sons and daughters of
Night Gate, Arkay heeded their plea for salvation and sent one of his children,
who took the form of a steel-clad warrior.

“Sons and daughters of the Pale. Fear no more, for Arkay has heard you pleas for
help. Reveal to me who is troubling the town, and I shall vanquish the foe in my
Father’s name.”

“O, Son of Arkay, look no further than the ruins of the Dwemer to the north of
here, for the Daedra of Oblivion that occupy there threaten to sack this town as
they have to others. Snowhawk has fallen; as have Heljarchen and Amol. Son of
the holiest of the Eight and One, vanquish the evil before Night Gate is lost as
well.”

And the warrior, not wanting to fail his Father, charged to the Dwarven Lift
that fell down to the city of Blackreach and slew the foul demons of the
Deadlands. Scamp after scamp fell to his blade as did the reptilian daedroth
that held the Jarl of Night Gate in his clutches.

The battle seemed to have reached its conclusion until Arkay sent his son a
vision; that he must brave the depths of Oblivion and close the gate that
threatened the town.

“Son of Arkay, you have done so much for this town. It is a thankless task you
are to perform to somewhere you hold no allegiances to.”

“Ah, but my Jarl, I hold allegiances to all men and women; whoever they may be.
I may pass to sit at my Father’s side during my mission, and if I do, remember
this; as long as you love my Father and give him praise, he will bless you with
great fortune. Stay true to the Nine, and my Father will give you his blessing
as you enter Sovngarde.”

A tear rolled down the Jarl’s face, and the whole town watched as the hero
entered the Gate to Oblivion.

For seven days and seven nights, the Jarl of Nigh Gate awaited the hero’s
return. No daedra had dared enter Shor’s Skyrim, and the people of Night Gate
thanked the Divines for the protection.

On the ninth day, an almighty roar shook Night Gate to it’s foundations. The
survivors of the earthquake look north to the gate of hell to see it’s fires
burnt no more.

They dared to see the ebon hole where the smell of death lingered. The Jarl held
aloft a skull stripped of flesh, that had been sat inside an amulet of Arkay.

“People of Night Gate! In my hand I hold the remains of our hero. Let us not let
his sacrifice be in vain. We shall rebuild our town, and it shall be grander
than the City of Cyrods itself. Praise be to Arkay, Praise be to the Eight and
One!!” A chorus of shouts were heard that shook the very souls of the daedra
that still roamed the Starry Heart.

“Let it be knownst that from this day forth, Night Gate shall become Arkay’s
town and his Son shall be the patron of the town. This day shall be a day when
every year we celebrate the joys of life and pray to Arkay that he gifts us a
long life upon this land.”

A hole was cut into the mountain where the Oblivion Gate had once stood, and the
Son’s skull was placed upon an altar, with the amulet placed nearby.
