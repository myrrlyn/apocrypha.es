Unlike the other Imperial territories like Roscrea, Esrionet, and Cathnoquey,
the islands that make up the 3rd Imperial Territory was brought into the
Empire’s domain by treaty rather than force. This Treaty – known as The Truce in
the East – was signed in 3E 279, a year after the discovery of Yneslea by
scouting vessels.

The Twelvemonth War began when the Legion made landfall the Ambient Littoral
region on Yne and encountered a community of Echmeri Exul on the surface. When
the natives attempted to make contact, a patrol slaughtered them ruthlessly and
the survivors fled belowground to the more sophisticated Urbs. The Council of
Dull Chimes immediately mobilized the Penta Wards and declared war on the
Empire. By then, however, many aboveground villages had already fallen to the
surprised and now hostile legionnaires – the death toll including the elderly,
women, and children. This drove the normally nonviolent Echmer into a frenzy,
and they began to deploy their war automatons to attack the Empire.

At first, it seemed that the Echmer would win by their superior knowledge of the
terrain and their massive war machines. However, the Empire soon discovered
their fatal weakness: their misunderstanding and disregard for magicka as well
as their zero amount of information on the Tamrielic races. Taking advantage of
this, the Empire turned the tide against the natives and surprised them even
further by breaking into the Dweech and taking control of their capital Urb,
Oexra’numsaz. To avoid the destruction of their city or the deaths of their
Troika (who sit on three of the seats in their Council), the Echmer proposed a
suspension of hostilities to negotiate with the Empire.

Uriel Septim V himself traveled to the islands to sign the treaty and legend has
it that the Echmer hero-god HRAHNDEYL manifested to speak with him (many
scholars take this as evidence that Uriel V was much like his ancestor Tiber,
who met with Lord Vivec of Morrowind for the legendary Armistice) about the
terms of acquisition. It is not a secret that many of the Echmer were taken
aback and enraged at one of their more beloved entities making peace talks with
the enemy, which is why The Truce in the East is still generally hated by the
Echmeri populace to this very day.

One of the main ideas of the Treaty was to allow Yneslea to have a large degree
of self-governance while also making it a territory of the Empire under Uriel’s
rule, resulting in the Emperor deciding to focus on both its economic and
military power. First Uriel V took full control over Yneslea’s trading business,
making it a major base of operations for the East Empire Company. He also placed
a massive garrison – Fort Musicmoth – on the islands, as well as restricting the
mobilizing of the Echmeri army and the production of their war automatons.

In return the Council of Dull Chimes maintained its status as the primarily
authority of the Yneslian islands, with the ancient Penta Wards and the Troika
staying in power. The Dweech itself became all but inaccessible to the Empire,
with only Oexra’numsaz being open to Tamrielic visitors. No Imperial monarch was
proclaimed for the islands, although representatives of the Empire were sent to
live in the aforementioned Urb. An Echmer Consul became the 25th seat of the
Elder Council and an embassy was established in Cyrodiil. The religious
practices of the Echmer were realized as a faith in the Empire and were not to
be encroached on; finally, Echmer researches were to remain outside of Imperial
control.

The Penta Wards all had mixed reactions, but nevertheless agreed to the Treaty.
The Coalescent Efflux went along coolly, probably not interested at all in the
proceedings. The Shattering Fusion was at first hostile, being the bulk of the
army, but submitted when it saw the normally distant and cold Neglectful
Acceptance sign without question. The Hidden Perception followed HRAHNDEYL’s
lead, and the Confined Abyss finally signed the Treaty after the Emperor swore
that the Imperial Battlemages would apologize for their embarrassment.

The Treaty led to the islands Yne and Slea (along with the massive underground
cavern system known as the Dweech, although it was entirely self-governed) being
recognized as separate Imperial administrative districts. These islands would
remain largely untouched by the Empire until the year 425, when they were opened
up to colonization. Eight years later the three small islands to the north known
as Hrahn’s Isles were also opened for settlement.
