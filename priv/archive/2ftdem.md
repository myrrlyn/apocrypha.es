## The World’s World

The Aurbis that we know of exists of several cycles not recorded, that stretch
back into times immemorial that have ceased to exist. Our Aurbis, the current
one, is nothing but the machinations of an even greater Aurbis that no longer
exists but we are a subset of it despite that. Even we do not truly understand
what this means, but we know of it.

The Greater Aurbis and Our Aurbis is separated by the nothingness which is the
VOID which in itself was nothing. VOID is VOID unto itself and it will continue
to be so. In this VOID a world, like but unlike ours, arose and life flourished.
Eventually two beings on this world came to become concepts and recognized
themselves as part of the VOID, and renamed themselves IS and IS NOT as they
ventured throughout it. Once again the VOID was filled, and in their wanderings
IS and IS NOT discovered another: MAYBE. As common of beings of their sort, both
IS and IS NOT were intrigued by MAYBE. Eventually, IS and MAYBE joined and IS
NOT was forced to redraw into the VOID. But IS NOT returned, destroying MAYBE
but only after she birthed twelve new concepts that became worlds separate from
their own. IS expelled IS NOT from the VOID before drawing into himself,
becoming his own world.

For many years the Twelve Worlds flourished until IS NOT found a way to reenter
the VOID, where he smashed the Twelve Worlds into almost nonexistence. IS unmade
himself as a world, and fought IS NOT until both of them were permanently
expelled from the VOID for all time where IS created of himself a new broken
world. Two of the surviving Twelve Worlds, HST and EHNFY, are drawn into this
broken world. Our Aurbis, the Current One, begins in the broken world.

OUR IS (PSJJJJ) and OUR IS NOT (HHMMM), subsets of the original IS and IS NOT,
become the Outer Realms known as OUR VOID and AETHERIUS. From these Realms come
forth the ATEDA. Those that sing the kinesis of PSJJJJ and find themselves
residing in it become the DRA and those that sing the stasis of HHMMM and find
themselves inside of it become the AEDR; these are roles that are
interchangeable, for they are imperfect beings and do not know their own role.

On ATEDA, ALORKH, learns of the Greater Aurbis but specifically MAYBE by looking
on Our Aurbis from the Side, learning MAYBE and becoming consumed by MAYBE. Thus
he decides to rebuild MAYBE, for every Aurbis that has, is, and will exist must
have MAYBE in it. He asks his fellow ATEDA for help; it is no secret that some
do and some don’t, for these are fickle beings and do not know their own minds.

GANUS and the GE begin construction on MAYBE, which was envisioned by ALORKH,
and TOSH presides over the endeavor. The DRA decide not to help, become
enraptured by MAYBE when it is completed. The AEDR are left to build MAYBE,
which they do. Some of them become the frame of the HEART OF MAYBE, which is
then settled with parts of the HST and EHNFY. The AEDR are tied to MAYBE and the
HEART OF MAYBE forevermore, which is not always so.

NRN is the HEART OF MAYBE and those that know the true meaning of this, which is
Three, can be truly gone from this world.

This is HOW WE CAME TO BE. And IT REPEATS.

MAYBE.

## From The Bowels of Nirn’s Womb

We do not know when we were created or why we were created, but we do know that
our kind has dwelled beneath the surface of our isles in total darkness since
before the final echoes of time stopped shaking the milieu. It was in this
darkness that we first began using the weakest form of reflected sound, which
allowed us to see in only two tones of color we came to call ‘the black’ and
‘the white’.

And then one day the Begetters came and entered our tunnels and caverns with
great instruments of noise. Back then our people were very small and were
frightened by the Begetters and their contrivances. The Begetters themselves
seemed fascinated by us, and especially liked our use of reflected sound. But
they were largely unconcerned about us, and we were ignored during those times
while they focused on other pursuits.

Right now you are probably wondering how we were able to understand their
speech, for we had never communicated with other creatures of their ilk before.
Our scholars believe that is because our ears are able to hear and discern
levels of sounds that other creatures can’t. I believe that too. But as the
Begetters began to build into our dark home, our ancient elders decided that we
would learn from them. The Begetters were still not concerned by us and so they
let our people fly amongst them as they created new contraptions. Soon, some of
our people were able to learn and speak their language, which surprised the
Begetters. After that, things changed. We became the Begetters servants and
workers, bringing them such objects as metal and ore to help them in their
research and in return they taught us how to read and write and how to perform
calculations.

But most importantly, they taught us about sounds.

Small sounds. Big sounds. Loud and quiet sounds. Sounds that went dead when
struck and sounds that reverberated throughout the air. We liked the sounds, not
only because they helped us see but also because they helped us learn more. We
liked the sounds. They made us comfortable in our simple existence.

Our masters also talked about greater beings, who they scorned for reasons that
piqued our interest. When we felt we could get away with it, we would read their
notes about them and wonder why they held such hatred for these beings, but we
never learned the answer. To this very day we have still yet to learn the
answer.

And then everything changed for us again, because one day we awoke to melt the
ore and start on our calculations when we noticed something.

The Begetters were gone. Vanished into thin air.

We continued working on the tasks they left for us, of course. They did not like
it when we slacked off in our work and we had all thought that they were simply
discussing more ideas in the Atrium, for that was one of several areas we were
not allowed to enter when the Begetters were alive. But then the following day
rose again to meet us and they still had not returned. And the next. And the
next.

Months went by.

Years.

Eventually, our people grew lost. We did not know what to do anymore. But then
our ancient elders spoke to us that we should forget the Begetters and claim
their cities and contraptions as our own. They told us that our masters had left
to continue research that they did not need us for, and at those words our
people became saddened because we were once again the useless creatures we were
before the Begetters came. But then they said that now we could research our own
things now; we could read the notes that our masters did not want us to read,
and improve on them. Essentially, we would become the masters. And so we did.

At least we tried too. We were not used to working together without supervision,
and soon descended into bloody war. Many of our people died during those violent
times, and to this day we do not crave violence because of them. Eventually, we
stopped our fighting and united as one race. Together, we finally began to do
what we had to do to make our people great.

We first melted down all of the Begetters constructs and remade them into other
images we preferred. Then we began rebuilding all of the cities on our isles,
making them more like the caverns and open spaces for flight. We destroyed most
of the Begetters light sources for we did not need them due to our use of
reflected sound. We made excursions to the surface to get more ore and materials
and created our own written and spoken language. We even used the race of
goblins above as a workforce, similar to how the Begetters used us so many years
ago.

We noticed that our work had changed us, both physically and mentally. No longer
were we the small, flying, furry creatures we were born as. We were
something…different…now. We had started to wear clothing like our Begetters used
to. We had created a government, replacing our ancient elders with the Troika
and High Hypothesians, among other titles. Sound had become the very essence of
our being, but it was no longer similar to the sound of the old masters. One of
our own even ascended into immortality, becoming sound and tying our race
permanently to the concept. All threats that came to us, we defeated.

And then one day you came.

There were a multitude of you. Tall ones. Ones with pointy ears only dwarfed by
our own and with a multitude of different skin tones. Ones covered in a lot of
fur or a little fur and ones covered in smooth ridges. You scared us, surprised
us. And when we attempted to talk to you, like we did the Begetters so long
ago…you attacked us. Once again our people was forced to fight, this time for
our very survival. At the one day, the fighting stopped. Our once quiet and
small world had now become large, because we were now a part of you too. And one
day your leader asked us who we were. And we responded.

We are the Echmer.

And this is our story.
