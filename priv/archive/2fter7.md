Circa 2E 583

While I frown down on the open and hostile arguments of the young Phrastus of
Elinhir and Lady Cinnabar Taneth, I must admit this work was inspired by them. I
was reading “Subtropical Cyrodiil” shortly after returning from my researches in
Valenwood concerning Daedric artifacts when I was called to Vvardenfell
immediately by the Great Moot.

Upon landing on the island territory of Morrowind I met with a member of House
Indoril named Falos. As soon as I saw the giant bat head impaled on the spear
beside him, I already knew what the problem was. Having read my book Echkin of
the Wrothgarian Mountains, Falos knew what the bat creatures were and how to
handle them without complaint. However, that wasn’t the reason why he requested
my presence here.

“These Echkin are different Eis,” he said bluntly. “And I want to know why.”

I questioned his statement. How in the world could they be different? Falos led
me to a rather large cage which housed what seemed to be a giant bat, except it
was different from any Echkin I had ever seen before. With bright red eyes, a
chitinous outer shell, and an ash coloring, I was taken aback by the creature.

“This is not an Echkin,” I stated firmly, but even I didn’t believe my own
words. This was without a doubt a giant bat, just one of a variety never
encountered before until this year.

According to Falos, his men encountered these Echkin when driving off a group of
annoying cliff racers from one of their camps. As the flying beasts flew past a
cave wall, a dozen giant bats flew out of the crevice and attacked them! A
brutal battle for the sky soon emerged, and the Echkin emerged victorious. They
beasts then turned their sights on the Dunmer below and swooped in for the kill,
only to be slayed and captured by Falos and his squad.

Never before had the Dark Elves encountered giant bats on the island, not even
in the ancient times when the Dwemer still walked below the ash. But being me, I
had my own list of theories already developing that I soon put to the test. I
stayed for seven months on Vvardenfell, studying cave systems and the giant bat
specimen. The results of these observations can be found below:

The Echkin in Morrowind must have become separated by the Echkin in either High
Rock or Skyrim (presumably the latter, due to its close proximity) due to some
sort of incident. These migrations were probably caused by underground cavern
systems being caved-in, isolating groups of the monsters from other parts of
Tamriel. Eventually these Echkin traveled to Vvardenfell, where they stayed
hidden in their tunnels feeding off the insects and other creatures sharing the
space with them. Their open hostilities were probably the result of the cliff
racers encroaching on what they seem to see as their territory, thus causing
them to rise above ground to attack the Morrowind native.

(This educated guess comes from Falos’s account, where the Echkin didn’t feast
on the cliff racer remains and instead preferred to kill them instead. Clearly a
show of dominance between the two creatures.)

So, the question on their being in Morrowind and their recent discovery is
answered. But what about their bizarre appearance compared to their northern and
western cousins?

Well if I understand my Tower Lore correctly, Red Mountain (as is White-Gold, as
is Crystal-Like-Law, as is Falinesti, as is the Throat of the World) is
constructed on one of the joint-points of Nirn and is thus a conduit of palpable
reality. These Towers are able to conform and utilize said reality by the
command of its creators or current masters. Thus, it is possible for the
environment of a particular province that is host to a Tower to be controlled
and changed depending on the mentality of the dominant race in the region. As
Lady Cinnabar put it in her book, Cyrodiil under the care of the Ayleids was a
jungle and Cyrodiil under the care of the Nedes (who disposed of the Heartland
Elves in the legendary Alessian Rebellion) became a temperate forestland.

What I’m composing is much more intricate and must be expanded sometime in the
future (probably by myself): but what if the Towers are capable of not only
changing flora, but fauna as well?

A good example for this would be Trolls. Although all of the subspecies of the
monster have the same regenerative ability as well as the three eyes, they
differ in both appearance and mannerism based on geographic location. In Skyrim,
the Frost Troll has a white pelt and a resistance to cold, preferring to dwell
in the icy mountains and caves in the province. In Cyrodiil, the Heartland Troll
has a murky greenish-black pelt and is much more openly hostile, living in caves
in the hills or in the plains far from civilized areas. In Valenwood, the Wood
Troll has a bright greenish-brown coat to blend in with the trees, which it both
lives in and also uses as a form of camouflage. By applying Tower Lore to this
theory, then it is quite possible in saying that the different subspecies of
Trolls are caused by the mystical properties of that region’s Tower.

So in my opinion, the Echkin of Vvardenfell originally looked like their distant
brethren in the Wrothgarian Mountains before migrating here in some earlier era,
presumably the First. It was here that the giant bats were caught under the
influence of Red Mountain and its Chimer masters, and slowly overtime took on
the appearance they have today. It could even be worth noting that the mystical
change of the Chimer into the Dunmer might also have a powerful effect on Red
Mountain, resulting in the surrounding flora and fauna to change to better suit
the new appearance and habits of their masters. However, I would be climbing
down into the realm of speculation and how I hate speculation.

Now I head back to Eastmarch, my new temporary base of operations as soon as
Cyrodiil becomes safe again to visit. Perhaps I shall do a book on the Echkin of
Skyrim whenever I’m ordered to or when I’m bored and have nothing else to do.
Nothing says I’m finished with a research topic like completing the set of
essays about it.
