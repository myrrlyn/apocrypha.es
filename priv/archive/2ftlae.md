## The Birth of Hunger and the Orgy that inspired Death

In the Darkened days of the beginning days, when All were shades of Black and
White, and the Eagle of Time issued forth to see the Mother of Night and they
comprised the New Era, The Grey Existence, Time bade Grey to issue forth.And
Space saw the Ideas and gave them position, but they refused to merely exist in
one place. The Waves of their fickle existence orbited the Waves of their Truest
Name, and so the Planes formed. but the possibility of their Existence Waves
were edgeless, and the Valence Shells of their Existence were no longer bound to
their truest names, and they were taken and traded and stolen, and the Edgeless
Planes twisted and formed the Molecule of the Aurbus, and it was called the
Wheel, and there was two Laws among them, Hunger and fulfillment, pull and push,
balance. And among the Planes was a Idea that twisted throughout, and that Idea
was Hunger, and it hid in the shroud of Night, for Oblivion is the safety of
Ambition from the Now Dead Laws. Space drifted into the Darkest Darkness, the
Void, and looked upon the Grey Place, and He did not behold the seat of Time,
and the Shroud of Night, but rather he saw the Molecule of All Existence, and
was saddened for he could not see himself in the orgy, though he was there. So
Space went to the Grey, and spoke of what he saw, and in the cacophony of
connection he knew not who said what, nor what even he thought. Hunger sent a
spark of Existence to space, who uptook it, and made it his own, and Space grew
Hungry. and Space longed for the Connection of all existence, for he did not see
his I, so he did not behold All, and he could not say We, the All and the I. And
Space in his hunger went to the seat of Time, and the Serpent ate, and he
consumed the Coldest Ones, and hid them in his Bones, and he defecated the
Nuclei of the Truest Names into Oblivion, and they lingered, floating there as
Planets. And Space came to the Scribe, and The Serpent began to eat, and the
Serpent ate the tongue of the Scribe, and bound the contents of his stomach to
it, and he ate the eyes of the Scribe, but the Serpent grew to fat, and he fell
into the sea of Night, and the Serpent was sundered in twain by the amount he
had eaten, and his Truest Name was split and floated above his vomit, and his
heart, and the tongue, and the Laws of the Cold Ones fell into the Singularity
of his Hunger, and Space was dead, and his Soul lingered over this New Planet,
and it still hungered for the completion of the Orgy that is All, and I and We.

## Hunger The Killer of Kings

In the days of the Era Zero, when Mortals first walked, The Dead Ones pressed
upon the New Planet, and there Laws were made truth, and the Mortals did as they
were told, and the Mortals built New Laws to crown their civilizations. And in
those civilizations luck gave some more than others, and the towers of those
civilizations became stratified, and there were rich and poor. And Hunger went
to the rich and made them forget necessity, and they ate from the hands of the
poor, and the rich grew fat, and they would gnaw upon the bones of all that was
below them, and they would grow so fat that their skin began to rip, and tear
and they were sundered, at their heart, or at their stomach, and they would keel
over, blue, or they would stumble and the contents of their bellies would
continue, and they would pop, and their organs would spill forth, and their
chyme would issue forth and spread at their impact. And others drank the spoils
of fruit, and they grew different from their wine, and they drank up vineyards
worth of wine, and they lost themselves, and they grew blind, and they perished
from as their insides became like the hide of scared combatants.

And Hunger would visit the handsome, and bade them to share their lust, and they
fucked until they were raw, and until they ran out of willing lovers, and they
went to those that would be bought, and they owned their bodies, and they fucked
those whores until they ran out of money, and then they would turn to those that
were beneath them, the poor and the captured. but Lust grew bored of all the
fucking, and he went to the young Mortals, and gave them the gifts of obsession,
and some grew hungry of feet, and some grew hungry to lash those around them,
and some grew hungry of pain, and they would be whipped until their bones showed
through, and then they would have their bones chewed on, until the chewers teeth
crumbled, and some grew hungry for their mothers and fathers, and for the
children, and for blood. And Hunger delighted in the kinks, and the orgiastic
pain. And Hunger blessed others with great features and feats. And some women
were given great members, and some were taught to produce magics from seed and
moans, and some were taught to pleasure with the swimming trouts, and others
could produce rivers where most men make drops.

And Ambition visited the poor, and bade them to set their sights high, and
Hunger laughed as the poor were stolen from in the name of Law, that the rich
might grow fat, and Ambition grew to completion as the rich were distracted with
their whores and wine, and did not notice the anger of the peasants and
proletariat, and the workers overthrew the fat kings, only to turn to the same
whores and bottles. And they became what they hated.

And Hunger drowns nations in semen, and hunger turns spouse on spouse, and all
Mortals cower at the shadow of Hunger.

_He is Hunger, He is Lust, He is Ambition, He is Sanguine, Fear Him, appease
Him._
