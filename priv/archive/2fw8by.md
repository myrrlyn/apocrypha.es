## [The Tsaesci Blood Pheasants]

![a pheasant](./2fw8by/IWAi88p.jpg)

As the name would suggest, the Tsaesci Blood Pheasant’s origins lie in the lower
mountain ranges of the nation of Tsaesci, located in the continent known as
Akavir, due east of Tamriel. Brought over to the Starry Heart by the Akaviri
Dragonguard in the First Era, the pheasants are now considered an invasive
species which, in turn, has led to the now traditional cull by the children of
the Eastern Nibenay on the first Morndas of First Seed.

## Appearence

Tsaesci Blood Pheasants look similar to the other fowl one would see in
Cyrodiil, save for the male’s unique colouring. Where the females wear the same
light brown plumage as the other fowls, the male’s topside is dark ash with
white shafts, with the breast of the bird being greenish-white, with the
unmistakable splatter of crimson upon its belly and tail feathers. Why the
pheasant has this unusal pattern is still unknown to scholars, but it is
theorised that one of the pheasant’s main predators, the Thrice-Tusked Boar,
will leave the bird undisturbed if it feels that it’s potential meal is has been
spoilt.

During the mating seasons, the skin around the males eyes will turn from a dark
shade of brown to a vibrant blood red shade, which is then used to woo potential
partners, of which the male will have many.

## Distribution and Habitat

Although the Tsaesci Blood Pheasants are more likely to be found on the
Cyrodillic side of the Valus Mountains, they are spread out all across the
Starry Heart; from the Wrothgarian Mountains in High Rock, to the Red Mountain
in Morrowind. During the summer months, they have been known to travel as far
south as Pyandonea, and it is thought that the Fuschian Peacocks of Pyandonea
are the result of the Tsaesci Blood Pheasants interbreeding with the native bird
populace of the isle.

The nest of the Tsaesci Blood Pheasants are most peculiar when compared with
other birds. Whether others will construct theirs out of twigs and leaves, the
birds in this tome collect the bones of it’s fallen friends amd build their
nests in the hedgerows near a collection of Conifer Trees. Scholars of the
Imperial Bestiary Society have experimented with the Tsaesci Blood Pheasants to
see if they would build a nest out of other animal bones, but the bones of their
own kind seem to hold a special connection to them.

If only we could somehow communicate with these amazing creatures, and discover
what untold secrets they hold. The limitless possibilities send shivers down my
spine.
