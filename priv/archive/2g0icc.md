When the world was split, geography was broken into the east west dichotomy and
the north south dichotomy. Latitudinal forces aligned with the temporal fields
of history and prophecy, and longitudinal forces aligned with the mystical
fields of fire and frost. Yokuda drifted into the mists of the distant past
while Akavir ventured further into the rising sun of the coming times. Old
Ehlnofey broke off to the south of Tamriel and Atmora drifted far off into the
north.

Many records remain from the golden age of the Aldmer, who inscribed their
knowledge in books and guarded them in libraries. The Giants had a different
method of recording information, a great deal of which was unfortunately left
behind during the abandonment of Atmora. Their nomadic lifestyle prevented books
from becoming a reliable method of instructing generations to come, so they
developed a rich painted language that utilized both pictograms and a simple
alphabet.

The pictogram symbols usually depict animals, while the alphabet is composed
mostly of interconnected circles and swirls, in sharp contrast to the harsh
clawed alphabet of Draconic. The literate members of a tribe would write
records, stories, poems, jokes, warnings, migration patterns, and insults on
rocks, trees, mountain faces, and even each other and the mammoths of the tribe.
Today, the script painted by the giants of Skyrim is a local language derived
from the original Atmoran, but there are no living giants who would be able to
read or decipher the ancient paintings of the Merethic Era or the early First
Era.

Where Aldmeri myths from this time are strongly numerological, the Giant myths
that have been preserved are much more strongly symbolical. It is from these
myths that a large part of ancient Nordic zoolatry stems. Atmorans of this time
worshipped a large pantheon of gods, but they had an especially a deep reverence
for Kyne. The mythical marriage of Kyne to Shor was one of the reasons the
Giants offered the Wandering Ehlnofey sanctuary after the Ehlnofey War.

Another aspect of Giant culture which is represented in Nordic society, even
more so than zoolatry, is the culture of hospitality. In Skyrim, the guest-host
contract is a sacred bond. Not even thousands of years of border skirmishes
could get the Nords to abandon that virtue. When Dunmer passed in droves over
the border, fleeing the catastrophes of Vvardenfell and the Arnesian War, the
Nords opened their gates and offered them shelter and protection, regardless of
their faith or political leanings. Today, the Jarls of Eastern Skyrim still
uphold their oath of hospitality, in letter if not in spirit. The only people
barred from the city are those known to habitually violate the Nordic guest-host
contract (Khajiit.) The Windhelm mandate forcing Argonians to reside on the
docks doesn’t stem from Nordic prejudice, but rather incidents of violence
between Argonian citizens and the Dunmer refugee population.

There is much to be learned from the gentle wanderers of Skyrim. Although I have
no doubt that the race of Giants will persevere, the dark times we’re living in
have brought ruination to many of their camps and tribes. If we want to preserve
their stories, and moreover bring them to the world of readers, we must act
soon. Any relationship with a tribe of giants must be built up slowly, over a
fair period of months. Gifts of painted cows and goats go a long way. If they
seem threatened by you, back away immediately. They’ll warm up to you and even
protect you from wolves and bears if you act like a member of the tribe for a
time.
