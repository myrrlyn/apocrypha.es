The smoking traditions in the west of the Cyrod reflect its people: Stout and
strong, yet surprisingly cosmopolitan, with strong influences from Skyrim and
Resdaynia in the north and east, and exotic imports from Hammerfell, High Rock,
and Elseweyr in the west. Indeed, around County Anvil, the tobacco aficionado
can find smokable pleasures to fit nearly any taste, however tastes become more
conservative as one travels closer Skingrad and Bruma. For the purposes of this
treatise, we will avoid discussion of the vast number of imports, and focus on
the local favorites.

Local favorites, however, are misleadingly cosmopolitan as well: From Anvil to
the Jeralls, the preferred favorite way of smoking is in massive,
freehand-carved pipes. These pipes are made of Briarwood from High Rock, carved
by master carvers in Skyrim, and loaded with tobacco grown and processed in
Argonia, High Rock, Topal Bay, and Hammerfell.

Among the poor working class and farmers, smaller, simpler pipes are favored.
The cheapest of these are semi-disposal and carved from corncob or Morrowind
Corkbulb. Individuals with slightly more money to spend in the pursuit of
nicotine pleasures may carry more permanent, simple pipes made of low-grade
briarwood.

The tobacco favored in Colovian pipe-smoking varies widely: Cavendish is a
variety of tobacco produced in High Rock from fine Topal or Blacklight leaf
tobacco, pressure-cooked with added sugars to lend it a sweet, mellow, aromatic
flavor. Others may favor the smoky, full-bodied flavor of tobaccos produced in
Hammerfell, with Rihad and Taneth being the primary producers, these tobaccos
are cured by hanging the leaves over fire-pits stoked with aromatic hardwoods
and exotic spice. The number and character of these blends is far to vast to
list here, but suffice it to say, pipe tobaccos in Colovia can be found to suit
any taste.

Nargile water-pipes, imported from Morrowind, are popular among the higher-class
individuals throughout the Jeralls and as far east as Cheydinhal. The Jurak
paste smoked in these pipes is a high-septim item, the finest varieties imported
directly from Vvardenfell, although cheaper, locally-produced inferior varieties
are available. The most popular, a blend called Ald Bal Mora, is produced by a
House Hlaalu subsidiary in Balmora and features Argonian blackleaf ground into a
paste, then treated with attar of roses, minced comberries, pomegranate juice,
and Cardomom pods, then pressed between cedar boards. This aromatic blend is as
quintessentially Dunmer as jurak can be, yet enjoys tremendous popularity in the
Cyrod, among both the common peoples and the landed elite. It is said that Uriel
Septim VII himself has quite a fondness for this brand, importing large
quantities for his own personal use. Perhaps more than any other product, this
brand has become something of a symbol of Dunmeri-Cyrodiilic cultural exchange.

Cigars enjoy a degree of popularity in Colovia, particularly among sailors and
legionaries, likely owing much to the ease of keeping. A soldier has little room
in his kit for such elaborate luxuries as loose tobacco and smoking apparatuses.
These are produced largely in the Topal bay area, of locally-grown leaf, and
bear little similarity to the crude Cheapees popular in that region, rather,
these are expensive, artisan-rolled smokes. Indeed, a box of cigars is
considered a high-value gift through Colovia, and a mark of class. Even more
expensive cigars are produced in coastal Argonia, and are considered the highest
quality available in all of Tamriel. Stros M’Kai has gained a foothold in the
market as well, producing cigars that rival the Nibenese in quality, but with a
unique, light and spicy leaf that packs a lot of flavor.
