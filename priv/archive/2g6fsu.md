Although the Bosmeri Green Pact has severely stunted the popularity of tobacco
and other fine smokables within the Valenwood, the Bosmer have developed a
wholly unique smoking tradition in spite of it.

Imported tobacco and smoking devices are a popular option all around the border,
at least among younger, less conservative mer. Typically these options reflect
whatever is popular across the border: Redguard and Colovian options in the
north, Khajiiti in the east, and imports from Summerset and Pyandonea in the
west. Bosmeri smokers in these regions typically can’t afford to be
discriminating, as tobacco leaf, even imported, is still considered something of
a black market item in many areas.

The traditional smoking tradition of the Bosmer involves the use of long,
richly-carved bone pipes. These pipes are deeply personal items, usually carved
from the thighbones of a particularly auspicious ancestor or respected enemy.
These pipes are considered heirloom items and often passed from parent to child
over many generations. It is believed by some Bosmer that these pipes have a
sort of spirit in them, infused from the original donor bone and amplified with
imprint of generations of use. Bosmer will often smoke when insight or guidance
is needed, silently puffing in a sort of meditative, trance like state, during
which a form of divination is practiced as the smoker reads portents in the
twisting curls of smoke. These pipes are rarely seen outside of Valenwood and
are highly sought-after collector’s items, frequently bringing in thousands of
Septims at auction. Occasionally, when important heirloom pipes fall into the
hands of outsiders, the families that formerly possessed them will go to great
lengths to secure their return, whether that means raising vast sums of money or
pursuing less savory means. There are multiple documented cases of thieves
guilds being contracted to acquire these items, and at least one known case
where the Dark Brotherhood was (successfully) employed to secure the return of
an heirloom pipe.

Younger Bosmer who have not yet earned, inherited, or crafted one of these
important pipes can often be seen smoking simpler, animal-bone pipes, or ones
crafted from horn, antler, or glass.

These pipes are almost never used to smoke tobacco, even the imported variety,
to do such is seen as a nearly blasphemous act, and is likely to get one’s pipe
re-possessed by family elder with such authority. Rather, the Bosmer have
aquired a taste for a rather unique blend of insects, grubs, and caterpillars,
plucked from the aromatic plants they feed on, suffocated in a leather bag,
dried in a hearth, then packed in the pipe and smoked in much the same fashion
as tobacco leaves. Special gardens are kept for this purpose, where bugs
normally considered pestilent are purposefully introduced. These bugs will take
on a degree of flavor from the plants they consume, and the range of flavors
produced in blending can vary widely. Psychotropic and Entheogenic plants are
often kept, and their effects carry over somewhat into the insect smoke.

Uncompelled by the statutes of the Green Pact, the Imga take great delight in
smoking tobacco, typically through long pipes of Altmer make (or, more often,
pale imitations thereof). The Imga grow their own tobacco, a breed called lo-to,
which is grown in marshy conditions and pressure-fermented in hollow wooden logs
at high temperatures. Lo-to is a dark, powerfully flavored leaf with a nicotine
content high enough to make most humans physically ill. The Imga take this as
just another indicator that they are the superior race.
