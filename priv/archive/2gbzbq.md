For the final portion of our study of the Smoking habits of the peoples of
Tamriel, we arrive at my home province, Morrowind. The Dunmer are among the
oldest smokers in Tamriel, with traditions that can be traced back to
pre-Velothi times. This aged tradition, coupled with cultural exchange, has led
to a rich and varied tradition in which the Dunmer do what we do best: absorbing
things from others and refining and perfecting them to suit our tastes.

I would be remiss without first mentioning the queen of pipes, the Nargile. A
waterpipe similar to the Khajiiti Huqqa, but of much more refined elegance. The
Nargile consists of a blown glass bottle and a metal stem, with a leather hose
for smoking and a clay bowl to hold the Jurak. The bottle is filled halfway with
water, and then the stem is placed in and affixed with the hose. The clay bowl
is filled with jurak, a paste made from sugared tobacco, fruit, and spices, and
then a small clay plate is placed atop the jurak, upon which large chunks of
red-hot charcoal are laid.

Among the Redoran and Telvanni houses, these pipes are richly decorated in a way
that reflects Dunmeri sensibilities,often incorporating natural, flowing
asymmetric forms in their design. Figural forms of Daedra, Tribunes, or
important ancestors are frequently incorporated into the shape of the pipe. To
these people, the smoking of the pipe is a casual social affair, shared among
family and close friends in the playing of games or quiet conversation.

Both the Hlaalu and Indoril favor Nargile with more conservative, symmetric,
understated designs. These are often made with stems of cast brass or turned
wood and tend to feature deep engravings of a more geometric or botanical form.
For the people of these houses, the Nargile’s social role takes on a higher
purpose, often a pipe is shared during business transactions, usually with the
selling party offering his finest Jurak in order to ingratiate himself with his
guest and ensure a polite transaction.

House Dres favors Nargile of finely worked brass and precious metals, often with
rich filigrees and finely carved details. These pipes are often the most
ostentatious of all smoking instruments, encrusted with precious stones and
minute embellishment. Dres landowners can frequently be seen lounging on the
patios of their villas, eating fresh fruit and puffing away while the slaves
toil in the fields.

The Ashland tribes favor Nargile as well, though their pipes are often of more
rough construction, typically with bottles made of corkbulb and stems fashioned
of hollow insect legs. These pipes will sometimes feature the skull of an
important ancestor in the design. Sharing a pipe has an important social
function among the Ashlanders, and the preparation of the pipe has taken on an
almost ritual status. Given the relative scarcity of clean water in the
Ashlands, it is customary for visitors to each provide a small portion of their
own water in filling the bottle, their own tobacco in loading the bowl, and
their own charcoal in lighting it. In this way, the smoke is a seen as a more
communal experience, with everyone sharing and partaking together.

The Jurak used in the Dunmeri Nargile is a mixture of very finely-chopped
tobacco (usually several types with complementary flavors), minced fruit,
perfumed oils, insect pheromones, molasses, honey, and aromatic herbs and
spices. This produces a black, gritty paste roughly the consistency of good
moist potting soil. The end result is usually sweetly flavored with an intense,
spicy, and complicated mix of flavors.

Every house has their own style of Jurak, with Hlaalu preferring a sweeter, more
playful smoke with a heavy influence from fruit. Redoran Juraks tend to contain
heavy earthy flavors of Saffron and medicinal herbs. Telvanni enjoy strong,
spicy flavors with an emphasis on Cardamom and Sandalwood. Indoril use a lot of
cedar, sage, and lemongrass in their blends. Finally, the Dunmer of House Dres
prefer a more tobacco-forward flavor, with the spice and fruit flavors taking a
complementary role to the strong, peppery tobacco. It is rumored that Lord Vivec
himself favors Jurak of the Redoran style, and in recent years it has become
fashionable among young Redoran pilgrims to leave a small amount of Tobacco at
his temple door when visiting the shrine.

The Temple priests will often use Nargile in their off-hours to relax and
discuss theology. These pipes are typically of Indoril make, with pipemakers of
that house frequently donating their Nargile as a sign of deference to temple
authority. Temple priests will also smoke long handheld bugshell pipes during
Sermons or lectures, usually loaded with Khlou, a uniquely Dunmeri mixture of
fine Argonian blackleaf tobacco and Hackle-lo leaf, which has been infused with
Pomegranate juice and pressure-fermented, giving the tobacco blend a mild, sweet
flavor.

Khlou has become somewhat popular outside of the temple during the Third Era,
with its energizing and invigorating effects making it popular among laborers.
Plantation owners have also caught on and will sometimes “gift” large volumes of
the blend to their slaves, as a perceived reward for hard work. The reward is,
in fact, a double-edged blade, as the smoke’s metabolic effect allows the slaves
to work longer, harder hours before tiring.

The Vehks’hadoon are a somewhat obscure sect of wandering ascetics devoted to
the worship of Lord Vivec and the understanding of his sermons. These Mer wander
Vvardenfell, and own little in the way of worldly possessions, dressing simply
in scarves and loincloths, and travel in bands of 6-10 mer, preaching the
sermons and living only off of the food that is offered to them, or what they
can scavenge from the land. The reason for their inclusion in this treatise is
their practice of smoking Jubeedi, a mixture of powerful psychotropic herbs. The
Jubeedi is smoked through a pipe made from the thighbones of deceased
Vehks’hadoon, carved into the shape of a spear or phallus, the bowl of which is
invariably carved into the shape of a merish vulva. The Jubeedi is lit from a
brazier of sacred fire which must be kept burning at all times. Should the
sacred fire go out, the band must immediately make a pilgrimage to Vivec city to
relight it. In the canalworks of the St. Olms Canton is a tiny shrine, the only
Vehks’hadoon temple, where sits the sacred brazier, burning with fire gifted to
the sect by Lord Vivec hirself, from hir own burning head. This fire has not
gone out since it was first lit in the early second era.

The effects of Jubeedi are fast and long lasting, causing the smoker to fall
almost immediately into a torporous stupor, in which they experience vivid lucid
dreams. The Vehks’hadoon believe this state of mind to be the closest a mortal
can achieve to understanding how the Lord Tribune hirself sees the world, and
that through regular imbibement of the drug, they themselves can become closer
to Lord Vivec.
