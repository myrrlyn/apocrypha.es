  Credit where it’s due, this was very heavily inspired by /u/julian_baubauhaus
  and his thread [here][0]. In Beyond Skyrim, this report will be found on the
  body of a dead courier. It grew out of a desire of mine to see the factions of
  the Civil War better fleshed out, as well as give the player a reason not to
  butcher every Legionnaire they see in Cyrodiil for trying to execute them.

FOR THE INWARD SEEING EYE ONLY

SKYRIM REPORT - INSPECTOR ‘CLAUDIUS’, 16^th^ LAST SEED, 4E201

Hail,

I hope this report receives you in good health. By the Divines, you’re going to
be feeling good when you’ve finished reading it.

As I’m sure you’re aware, I was assigned to the Skyrim task as a personal
attaché of General Tullius, and to monitor the increasingly warm Cold War
between the Empire and the Domnion. And it is getting… well, _warm_, especially
since Ambassador Elenwen’s own reassignment to the North after the Markarth
Incident.

I’m going to assume you’re familiar with the official version of the Civil War
in Skyrim – I understand _‘The Mudcrab’_ can’t get enough of it – but events up
here have finally taken a positive turn. General Tullius has (just an hour
before this documents was drafted) captured the Bear of the North himself!
Ulfric Stormcloak and a cadre of supporters were trying to sway the Orphan Rock
clan of witches in Falkreath into treason against the Empire, when they were
tempted by a bait force of legionnaires. To their great credit the men were able
to draw the Stormcloaks close enough to the border with Cyrodiil to allow a much
larger force to incapacitate the traitor and his men. They are now being
escorted under heavy guard to Helgen, an Imperial stronghold in the area.

My own investigations into the character of Ulfic Stormcloak himself have turned
up some very interesting tidbits. We’d been aware for a long time of his status
as a potential asset of the Thalmor, but if he ever operated in their interests,
one thing is clear; the Thalmor had _utterly_ lost control of him. This uprising
beyond mere agitation and distraction from the Empire’s southern borders, and
into the realms of true, full scale secession. Elf soldiers and agents rarely
make it out of Stormcloak held territory in anything approaching one piece, and
as far as I can tell the leadership of the natives had refuted all direct
communication with the Thalmor or their embassy. This is not to say they aren’t
receiving any outside support; I’ve provided an attached list of fourteen
companies and organisations I suspect of providing arms, armor or funds to the
Stormcloaks, many of which are registered under Altmer (and Imperial) names. But
Ulfric appears to have purged himself and his organisation of overt Elvish
influences some time ago – whatever he was fighting for in the end, he bloody
meant it.

It appears inevitable that Elenwen will try some last minute, desperate attempt
to keep Ulfric alive and this war going; as of writing, she has unsuccessfully
attempted to take command of the prisoner detail herself, and has demanded to
speak to Tullius again upon their arrival at Helgen. Of course, after passing
into Thalmor hands, the Stormcloaks will make a ‘miraculous’ escape attempt, and
the war will rage on. Tullius, for his part, has treated any threats (diplomatic
or otherwise) with all the contempt they deserve. Two seemingly unaffiliated
individuals were caught in the ambush and interred with the rebels, a horse
thief and a traveller from over the border. They are being treated as potential
inside agents or jailbreakers – after all, their timing seems a little too
convenient for anyone’s tastes, and this time the General is determined not to
take any chances.

Which brings us to our last point – the summary execution of Ulfric Stormcloak,
his supporters, and any suspected enemy agents upon their escort to Helgen. No
trials, no protests, no escape.

Short, yes, brutal, absolutely, illegal, quite possibly. But frankly, I – we –
just want this damn war over. The men of the IV Legion want to go home. And
every minute Ulfric stays alive, not only prolongs the bloodshed, it strengthens
the Thalmor. It makes it more likely Elenwen, the horse thief, or the traveller
will enact an escape plan. It means more dead men, women and children. It’s in
everyone’s best interests that every prisoner captured meets their end at Helgen
to avoid a long, protracted war. I am willing to personally vouch for Tullius if
you feel this is beyond his remit to end the uprising.

I will be sending this message with a messenger of the General, while I
accompany him to Helgen to see the end of all this. You’ll find the Bear of the
North’s head following a few days later, with my full report. I look forward to
my debriefing back home.

Long live the Emperor!

Agent ‘Claudius’
