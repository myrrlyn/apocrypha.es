After the Aldmeri Dominion’s sequestering, the first person to enter the lands
of Yokuda-once-lost was a Dunmer criminal named Wabbi the Liar. A diminutive
thief of slight reputation, Wabbi earned his nickname from his notoriously poor
relationship with the truth. When the publican of a thief-centric ale-hole
spotted him with an odd pocket full of glimmering clink, he asked the
bright-haired Liar where he’d stolen it. Rumor and legend state that the
conversation resembled the following:

“Off a water-rotted corpse. A Redguard lady, that.”

“Didn’t have you labeled as a grave-botherer, Wabbi. You pullin’ it?” the
publican asked.

“S’truth, I promise. Ancient and well-guarded, she was. By a chastity belt of
Altmer sailors as long as my prick but half as wide,” the Dunmer winked.

“So what is it, then?” The publican leaned closer to see what the thief was
concealing in his hands. “Looks like a frog.”

“Magic frog,” the thief corrected him.

“Magic…”

“Yeh.”

“…Frog.”

“Yeh.” The Dunmer leaned closer, his bright red eyes gleaming. “I gives it a
squeeze, everyone in the bath’ll go Tom.”

“What, in the head? Or pukin’?”

“Both, I reckon.”

“Who’s Adam you half that from?” The publican was growing impatient by this
point, convinced that Wabbi was living up to his nickname once again.

“No one’s, honest! Found it!”

“Pull the other one, lad, it’s got bells on.” But before the bartender could
move back to serving his more honest clientele, Wabbi gave in.

“Alright, alright,” he grumbled, reaching back into his pocket for another item.
“Feast yer minces on this dolly number.”

When the publican saw the glittering wheel, his shout was so loud it silenced
the bar. All eyes turned to Wabbi and his golden treasure, and no salt-worthy
man in that room had not heard of the Baron’s Wheel that spun quickly and killed
slowly.

Wabbi’s hand twitched, and the tiny soap-colored frog croaked, and every man
within earshot fell to the ground, groaning and retching from a violent,
stabbing headache. Noses bleeding, they clutched the backs of their heads as
though their spines were growing too long for their necks.

“Alright, gardens!” Wabbi shouted. “Sit back on your kingdoms or I gives this
toad another watford, hear me?” With a leap he stood on the creaking bar top,
toad in one hand, golden wheel in the other. “Believe me, today is not the day
you want to remember as the day you braced your surreys. No, friends, today is
the day you find out about a peasy little lemon just wet and waiting for your
three-card-tricks!”

Pacing the length of the bar top, Wabbi began to explain how he had managed to
achieve the impossible. He hadn’t just breached the Aldmeri Dominion’s
barricade, he’d bypassed it entirely, having found a way to reach the shores of
Yokuda without ever crossing the naval sequestration. Though it required
numerous dire sacrifices to Clavicus Vile and a particularly difficult argument
with Azura, a few more infiltrations were possible.

Within a half-decade, the scavengers of Yokuda were operating full-time. But
“Wabbi’s Route” was not the only way to reach those scattered isles.
