**I want to thank you kindly for your hospitality and your time. This Whiterun
Ale is delightful. For my readers back home in Anvil County, would you briefly
introduce yourself?**

“Aye. I am Villads Grey-Mane. I’m a blacksmith.”

**Sir, that is a wonderfully adroit introduction, but don’t you think you sell
yourself a bit short? You are a legendary master-craftsman of Clan Grey-Mane.
Your steel is world famous.**

_At this point my host merely shrugs and takes a sip of Whiterun Ale_

**I can tell your humility is genuine, sir, so I shan’t shower you with praise.
First off, tell us a little bit about your family history.**

“The Grey-Manes? We came over on that ship up on the hill, near Dragonsreach.
The Jorrvaskr. Me ancestors fought alongside Jeek of the River and founded
Whiterun Hold. The Grey-Manes were craftsmen back in Atmora and we’re still
Craftsmen here. I don’t obsess over that stuff meself, laddie. I’m just a simple
maker of arms and armor.”

**The Jorrvaskr and the Companions are world famous. What does it mean to you to
be a Companion?**

“Look, fella. That’s an annoying assumption to make, yer ken? I ain’t actually a
Companion myself. I just make their stuff ‘n keep it in good shape. Pretty much
always been a Grey-Mane workin’ fer the Companions. It’s a tradition. Passed
down to me from my ‘da, and from his ‘da to him on back to the beginning.”

**Let’s talk about that beginning you mentioned. I read a Brief History of
Whiterun Hold, and it mentions local oral traditions on the Skyforge. Is it true
that the Forge was already here when the Nords arrived?**

“That’s not business fer outsiders like yer, laddie. No offense. I find yer
tolerable for a Heartlander.”

_At this point in the interview, I pulled back part of my cloak to reveal my
Amulet of Kyne. His eyes widened a bit, and he nodded._

“Colovian, then. Aye. Some of yer still keep to the old Gods. The proper Gods. I
can tell yer a little bit about me beliefs, then. Sure. Yeah, we didn’t build
the Forge. Truth is the Daughters of Kyne built it, back before Man nor Elf sat
foot in this part ‘o the world. They’ve always looked out fer us, you know. The
old Gods. A lot ‘o yer Heartlanders worship money or damned bulls or some
nonsense but not us. We know our Gods are real and they look out fer us. Kyne
most of all. She breathed life into our forms. She gave us the Voice to crush
our enemies, and yeah, she had the beautiful Forge made in her image, and
infused with her Divine blood.”

**So is it the blessing of Kyne that infuses your Skyforge Steel with such
particularly fine qualities?**

“Eh…not me Forge, laddie. It belongs to the Mother o’ Storms. I just keep the
fires lit for ‘er while we await the Final Battle, yer ken? But yeah. It’s ‘er
blessin’ that infuses me steel arms and armor with such power. That an’ a
thousand years o’ Smithin’ tradition passed down through me family. I can’t take
credit for either. I’m just a humble servant of the people o’ Skyrim.”

**Your loyalties are to Skyrim, then? To the High King?**

“My loyalties are to me family first, the Hold second, the Jarl third, Mother
Skyrim fourth, and yer Imperials least of all. I reckon the taxes ain’t that bad
lately, though.”

**You didn’t mention Smithing as a passion of yours, there.**

“Smithin’ is what I do, laddie. It’s all I know. It’s not so much that I love it
as I don’t have a choice. I’m the eldest male of Clan Grey-Mane, and by long
tradition we man the Skyforge. That’s about it.”

**What of the rumors of civil unrest, and resentment of the Akaviri Potentate’s
policies? Does this increase business at the Skyforge?**

“By all the Gods if that ain’t a cynical an’ insultin’ question. Look. I find
yer tolerable, and it’s clear yer an outsider and yer ways ain’t ours, so I
won’t run yer through, but listen. I’m only gonna say this once, laddie. I’m not
runnin’ a damned business. I make steel for the Companions. I do it to support
me family, and the people who serve Skyrim. They fight fer honor and glory, and
the protection of our people. They ain’t mercenaries. You’ll wanna go to that
den o’ thieves called Riften an’ look up the Fighters Guild if yer wanna find a
bunch o’ thugs who fight an’ kill for money.”

**What’s the importance of the Sword in Nordic culture?**

“Well that was an abrupt change of tone. The Sword, eh? Short sword? Long sword?
Greatsword?”

**Long sword.**

“Ah. Thought so. Weapon o’ Kings, that. Shor’s weapon, matter o’ fact. Did yer
know that? ‘Course not. They don’t teach that in yer fancy universities. Truth
is, with the ‘ception of the longsword, a weapon’s a weapon, boy. They all cut
an’ kill an’ smash an’ maim. Longsword’s a bit more than that. It’s an
Ancestor.”

**An Ancestor you say?**

“Sure, sure. Didn’t yer know? Steel is made by mixin’ Iron with another
compound. Carbon, yer educated types call it. Lotta people use Coal er somethin’
like that. Here in Skyrim, when we make a Longsword, we always use the bones of
an Ancestor in ‘em. My sword has my ‘da’s shin bone in it. Did yer know that?
Well yer do now. Back in the old, old days the mightiest Kings and Thanes used
Dragon bones in the process. The Dragons were our strongest, mightiest
Ancestors. That’s the honest truth. Betcher didn’t know that either. But listen
to me. I’m an old man who had too much to drink. Are we about done here yet?”

**Sure. One more question, if you don’t mind. What’s your best tip for someone
who wants to be a Master Smith, like you?**

“Heh. Don’t. If yer gotta be a smith, just be the best yer can. Don’t copy an
old fool like me. Don’t think yer steel’s ever gonna match what Mother Kyne
gifts me with, either. It can’t and it don’t have to, laddie. Yer can kill some
poor fool with the cheapest iron or bronze long sword if yer sever the right
artery. Best sword in the world ain’t much in the hands of a piss-poor
swordsman. Maybe yer should interview a swordsman next?”

**I plan on it, actually. I thank you for your time, good sir.**

“Aye. I wish I could say the same. Now if yer excuse me, I have some hard
drinkin’ to attend to.”
