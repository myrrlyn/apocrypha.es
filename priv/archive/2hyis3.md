Greetings soldiers and welcome to volume four of the Imperial Field Guide. In
this volume we will be covering the Redguards. Their homeland of Hammerfell is
the most recent province to leave the Empire after refusing to halt attacks on
the Thalmor who had occupied their southern coasts. Although the Redguards were
once part of our glorious Empire, they no longer call themselves our allies.
They are bitter and say that we “abandoned” them after the Great War and that we
could have defeated the Thalmor if we had more spine and now look upon the
Empire with disdain. Although unlikely, we must be prepared for a conflict with
Hammerfell if they decide to take action on the wrongs they feel we have
committed towards them. As master bladesmen and warriors we must not
underestimate the threat they could pose even without the aid of allies.

Once again, we will begin with the armor of the Redguard warriors. Although some
Redguards prefer heavier armors, most prefer their garments long and billowing,
often light or pale in color, and literally topped off with head shading covers.
Most Redguard warriors, especially those native to Hammerfell, prefer lighter
and more agile attires, often with sandals or other breathable footwear. When
heavy armor is donned, it is forged to cling tightly to the body to insure some
degree of agility. It is not uncommon to see these armors embedded with
gemstones and jewels from the Alik’r desert. Redguard weaponry shares the same
level of beauty as their robes and armors, often boasting gems set into a
sword’s handle or a staff’s grip. The heavier the blade, the more intricate the
carvings become, often harkening back to Yokudan traditions of the sword saint.
Redguard swords are light to hold as they favor quickness over weight in their
curved swords. Blunt weapons are largely unpopular amongst the Redguard people,
though they are still forged mostly for younger generation who are more out of
touch with ancient Yokudan traditions. The scimitar is the most prominent weapon
used, and is almost like an extension of the body to most Redguard warriors.

The Redguard warriors are some of the finest on all of Nirn, boasting almost
unfathomable individual skill with a blade, out sparring even the finest of
Imperial swordmasters. The majority of Redguard fighters wield scimitars; curved
swords made to slash their way through flesh like air. Although these Redguard
bladesmen are nearly unparalleled in single combat, they lack discipline and
order on the battlefield. The fierce pride and independence of these desert
people leaves them often serving their own interest and taking to their
commanders orders like a Bosmer takes to cutting timber. Many of the Redguard
warriors will outmatch the common legionnaire in single combat, yet be defeated
as a whole due to lack of strategy and discipline. If you stray from your
comrades and are faced with fighting one of these swordsman man to man, you are
more likely to survive by retreating back to your unit than attempting to fight
them head on. Do not break ranks and do not stray from your allies, for your
coordination is your best weapon against these desert dwellers.

The Redguard people make excellent scouts and skirmishers thanks to their
natural agility and athleticism. They do not favor large battles but instead
numerous small conflicts in which enemy coordination and strategy mean less than
each warrior’s individual skill. The desert is their home and they defend it
more fiercely than a bear defends its den. Do not stray too far into the
sweltering sands of Hammerfell, for if thirst does not kill you, Redguard
warriors surely will. Avoid open ground where your forces can be split and
instead attempt to engage in smaller, more enclosed areas where your forces will
be able to force the swordsmen to face your shield wall instead of individual
legionaries. Along with the tactical advantages, smaller spaces heavily
disfavors scimitars and other slashing weapons and instead favors weapons
capable of swift stabbing motions, putting our legions equipment at an
advantage.

The Redguards frown upon the use of conventional magics such as the spells cast
by the Altmer or Bretons and instead practice more specialized magics. We know
these fearsome warriors as Sword-Singers, but the Redguard people refer to them
as Ansei. These warriors spend years of their lives perfecting the art of
forming a Shehai, or a sword forged from the singer’s own spirit. These Yokudan
warriors were some of the first to settle what is now known as Hammerfell and
were legendary in skill. Luckily for us, the Way of the Sword has nearly been
lost, with very few Singers left able to form a substantial enough Shehai.
Although they may be few in number, we must respect the Ansei for their combat
prowess and intense spiritual fortitude.

The Redguards are a proud people, exceptional in combat, mind, and body. Their
warrior culture demands that the soldiers of the legion respect their skill of
the blade and fearlessness in battle. They are proud. Too proud. They lack the
disposition needed to perform grand maneuvers and complicated formations. Our
legions must stand together as an unbreakable wall of metal, never faltering in
discipline and unity. Keep your shields up and your shoulders to your fellow
legionaries’. Stray from your legion and you will be cut down without doubt. Our
legions’ strength does not come from the strength of each warrior. The strength
of the legion is the legionnaire, and the strength of the legionnaire is the
legion. Remember this as you stain the sands of Hammerfell red with the blood of
your enemies.

The allegiance of Hammerfell remains to be seen and will soon be revealed in the
coming years. We can be certain that they are indeed enemy to the Thalmor and
the Aldmeri Dominion. With luck they will aid us if there comes another war with
the Thalmor, but we can never be too sure. We are prepared to defend our Empire
from any threat, anywhere in Tamriel and Hammerfell is no exception.
