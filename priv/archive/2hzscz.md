So you want to be an Akaneer, eh?

A noble calling if there ever was one, prospect! The Order of the Broken Wyrm is
always looking for new candidates to support the Jillian Efforts, Whether it be
through piloting the Voidships, Temporal Reconnaissance, or even things as basic
as Minute-minding, which you yourself have shown an interest in.

And who wouldn’t? Minute-minding is a gratifying field to find employment in,
and is a service to all the denizens of the Mundus who are temporally minded,
unlike a certain set of ungrateful trees. Your 12 cycle crash course in
Minute-minding will acquaint you with all the basics in building the various
Minute-minding devices used in the Jillian Efforts! Some of the things you will
be learning are:

1. Chronocule degradation theory
2. Applications of Aetherial Dispersion
3. Margin of Error Training
4. The Importance of Redundancy
5. And many more!

We look forward to seeing you Prospect!

For the Jillian Effort!

_Signed by the Chief Recruiter, Order of the Broken Wyrm, 9e Cycle 122_
