In this essay I’m going to explore the relationship firstly between concepts and
divinity (using Arkay as the perfect example), secondly between concepts and the
Thu’um, and third between the Thu’um and divinity.

Part 1: Concepts and Divinity

As we all know, each TES deity has a sphere of influence which defines the way
they interact with other TES characters. Kyne is nature, the sky, etc., and
causes storms. Mehrunes Dagon is destruction, so he destroys stuff. And so on.
This is reminiscent of the various gods of various real life mythologies:
Poseidon rules over the sea, Thor is the god of thunder and all that.

However, in TESlore, it goes deeper than that. All things in TESlore are aspects
of a higher being, called the Amaranth, and the various deities are embodiments
of the most important concepts at play in the Amaranth’s mind. These beings have
the power (creatia) to shape the dream in the image of their sphere, and also
have an intrinsic understanding of the concept that matches the Amaranth’s
vision for it (knowledge). This knowledge, power, and the purpose of making the
knowledge a reality using their power, is most of what makes their identity
(AE). Most of these concepts always existed, and therefore most of these beings
always existed. Sometimes, however, an important new idea is formed, leaving a
sphere open. Whoever picks up that knowledge may pick up the AE of a new god.

Here I turn to the example of [Arkay][0]. As stated here and in Varieties of
Faith in the Empire, Arkay is not regarded as primordial; instead, being a god
of mortality, he aptly possesses origins as a mortal. Like Arkay himself, the
sphere of life and death is not primordial. Before Convention, all beings were
et’Ada, or primordial ada (immortal concept-beings whose ranks include Aedra and
Daedra). When Mundus was created and the mortal coil began, however, the
important idea of life and death was created as well. In this story, we observe
Ark’ay the man picking up the knowledge necessary to take up the AE of Arkay the
god. It is not insignificant that he was on his deathbed, and that he did not
have enough time to fully complete his work: one thing necessary for the Arkay
the god to know is that mortals desire immortality and fear death because they
feel that they have not done all of the things they want to do. One cannot walk
a path without knowing or learning how to walk the path, and one cannot truly
know how to walk the path without walking the path. Life and death became
manifest through Arkay because he was the one who understood it well enough to
represent it in the Amaranth’s mind.

The idea of duality is important enough for a god to fill it since duality
defines CHIM, and Vivec rose to the position “God of Duality” not just with the
Heart of Lorkhan but with his understanding and practice of duality as well.
When Shor’s sphere had no one to represent it, Talos took up that mantle.
Mannimarco became the embodiment of undeath, and used Numidium to make it such
that undeath as Mannimarco was important enough to warrant apotheosis (the
Numidium’s tonal architecture capabilities include giving people godhood by
shifting the Dream to include their divinity as a reality).

**When these ideas become as important as the primordial divine-tier ones, the
beings to master these ideas become as important as the primordial divine tier
ones.**

Part 2: Concepts and the Thu’um

This one is fairly simple. You learn what fire is on the metaphysical level, and
you become capable of insisting on fire. Your willpower, which relates to Anuic
self insistence, drives the reaction. Your own creatia is the battery, since the
Thu’um does not pull from your magicka reserves. Your knowledge pertaining to
fire sets the Tone of a YOL TOOR SHUL to work correctly.

**In short, you have to know a concept to insist upon it, just as the gods have
to know their concepts in order to embody them.**

Part 3: The Thu’um and Divinity

Herein lies the crux of it: when a deity Shouts, they are pulling from knowledge
of their sphere so as to enact their sphere: concept-made-real, which is the
whole point of the Thu’um. And concept-made-real is the point of ada as well, as
each ada and all they do is the realization of the concepts pertaining to their
sphere. Moreover, the Thu’um carries a link to divinity in that it does not use
magicka: gods do not borrow power from Magnus, instead using their own, and use
of the Thu’um satisfies this. When Kyne shouts storms into the world, she uses
her own power and knowledge. The Thu’um, then, is how Kyne operates; it is the
expression of her power and her sphere and how her divine concepts are made
manifest. She shares this with other notable beings: the rest of Nordic pantheon
(including Alduin and his dragons), Talos, Akatosh, the Last Dragonborn, Reman,
and in its own way the Numidium (more on that later). It’s not just the language
of dragons, it’s the language of the gods of Man.

The greatest example is Talos. [Here][1], the loss of his Voice is compared to
the loss of Shor’s Heart, and even cited as an example of AE alignment. Shor’s
Heart was the source of his power, how he made his ideas manifest, and so it is
with Tiber’s Throat.

In short, the Thu’um is the way Man-aligned deities exert divine-tier magical
power. When a Greybeard shouts, he is changing the world in the exact same way
that many gods do, albeit probably on a smaller scale. And an important detail
of a Man-aligned deity (with the exception of the Yokudan pantheon) is that he
or she uses the Thu’um as a crucial way of realizing their sphere.

If your AE is the embodiment of a certain concept, if you know it in and out,
and if you use your own power to make it manifest in the world (particularly
using the Thu’um)? You’re walking the way gods walk. More on that later.

**TL;DR: The Thu’um is godspeak magic closely tied to divinity.**
