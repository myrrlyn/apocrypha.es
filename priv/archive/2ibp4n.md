My interpretation of Nirn:

1. Before Amaranth, there were 12 worlds, and out of these eventually was born
   Lorkhan. He proposed a plan, and the beings of that universe conspired to
   make Nirn.

2. Auriel, even, believed the plan. He called for the beings to convene outside
   of time to create this world. We don’t know exactly what Lorkhan's plan was.
   We know it represented something very different from how things worked at the
   time. We know it the gods bought into it. We know that many consider it to be
   a trick.

3. They convened outside time so that the new world could take its course
   independent of them. Convention, then, is a ritual. It is the Tower.
   Lord/Thief/Mage. It’s not Ada-Mantia, it’s Aurbis. This ritual was Amaranth.
   This is how Anu's dream was born.

4. **There was never an actual Convention!!** The history of Nirn _is_
   Convention. Convention is a myth, an allegory that describes what Nirn is.
   Within that story are a thousand variations. In one variation, everything is
   governed by story spinners, tales of great creatures, spirits bound up as
   trees and forces of nature. In another variation, the spirits build their own
   tower, their ambitions set on an earlier time. Some variations feature the
   presences of mischief makers, Daedric Lords touching spirits and making cats
   of them. But all these infinite variations are contained in the story of
   Convention itself. The are Convention itself.

5. Auriel saw in this multifaceted Nirn weak mortal spirits that could not
   endure it. This was Lorkhan's trick, in a way. This was Nirn collapsing and
   the end of the 12 worlds. He tried to hold it together. His echoes – the
   elves – in their _collective_ story represent Auriel trying to fight or build
   or craft His way to a solution to this chaotic heat death of the universe
   caused by man.

6. But He lost Altmora to the men. In other words, the men fought their way
   outside of the influence of elves.

7. They chased elves to Old Ehlnofey – Tamriel – the men returned to vex the
   elves.

8. The men split the land into many, the provinces. They facilitated the Dance
   of Towers. Where the elves were trying to consolidate Nirn, man frustrated
   this tower-building effort. Tamriel became 8 and 1 provinces, 8 and 1
   variations of the Convention story physically bound together.

9. All the while, as man marched across the land during the age of Myth, the
   ghost of Lorkhan – his impending presence – followed behind them.

10. Finally, at the ends of the land, at the Heart itself, Lorkhan was to claim
    his heart. It was kept away from him in a fortress, the “City of the Strong
    Shield". Then: “Finally Trinimac, Auriel's greatest knight, knocked Lorkhan
    down in front of his army and reached in with more than hands to take his
    Heart. He was undone. The Men dragged Lorkhan's body away and swore blood
    vengeance on the heirs of Auriel for all time.”

11. The elves of Resdayn, the Dwemer-as-Trinimac, stopped Lorkhan's advance.
    They removed his reclaimed heart from him, and then were betrayed.

12. So, within Tamriel's own sordid history is the story of Convention. They are
    one and the same. Or, history is a subgradient of the myth of Convention.

EDIT: If you don’t like the Dwemer/Trinimac theory, then substitute “Ayleids”
for Dwemer. Only now Red Mountain is a variation, or gradient of the greater
struggle of elf against man. Thus, it’s the “Ayleids” who have yet to finish the
story, as nu-hatta's little conspirators. Same difference.
