…the land of Cyrodd had grown somber over the years, and so the passing of fair
Ami-El was met with much weeping and quiet, uncomfortable thought towards the
future, though the land had a capable and worthy heir. For many nights, the Lord
and the Lady (for Ami-El had truly been both for her people) would not appear in
the sky, so that it appeared even the stars mourned her passing. As was custom,
the Ruby of Empire was left to adorn the body in vigil within the Temple. The
late Empress had no true family save her grief-stricken son, so her vigil was
attended only by the Temple elite, a handful of nobles, and a mysterious Kothri
tribeswoman who arrived just days after Ami-El’s departure to the scaled side of
Akatosh. Marukh the Prophet prostrated himself in prayer before the corpse and
the Stone for 5 days and 6 night before abruptly departing, his face twisted
with solitary illuminations and mind-splitting insights, barely contained. He
departed the city soon after, and would not return again.

The coronation was a grand international affair, a ceremonious and deeply
religious event. Praise, prayers and ceremonies honoring the Dragon and the
Mother of Empire lasted for several hours. Memorial and praise to the
accomplishments of fair Ami-El followed, then the prince, with great solemnity,
claimed the Ruby of Empire from her cold breast, and annointed himself Emperor.
Kings, dukes, and lords from all kingdoms and clans of the Heartland pledged
fealty to Gorieus as he mounted the Ruby Throne.

Of foreign attendance were the Beast of Anequina, the Nordic High King and his
heir-apparent, the Chimer general Nerevar, and Dumac the Dwemer-King, both of
strange and heathen Resdaynia in the distant East, all come to pay their
respects. Half of Nirn’s provinces bowed that day to the glory and honor of
Empire.

Each lord in turn approached and offered tribute to the new Emperor. Fierce
Senche war-mounts, exotic and incredible raw materials, \[untranslatable\], fine
moth silks, and ancient tomes and sagas were gifted between the more mundane
offerings of wines, spices, gold and loyalty.

That night, the Serpent chased the Apprentice across the sky as the emperor
slept in his new chambers at the top of the White Tower. Few saw the portent,
and fewer still understood it, but the Kothri tribeswoman departed swiftly, and
her tribe….
