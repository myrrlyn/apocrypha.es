VOLUME XIV IN DAEDRA WORSHIP ACROSS TAMRIEL

Compared to the other sixteen Daedric Lords, Peryite is one of the lesser known
and more enigmatic Princes revered in Tamriel. His followers tend to keep to
themselves within isolated locations, and few actual depictions of the Prince
exists. Many of the writings about him are also fragmented or esoteric in
nature, making him one of the many “known mysteries” of Oblivion.

Peryite is – along with Nocturnal, Clavicus Vile, and Vaermina – one of the few
Daedric Princes who isn’t found in any of the traditional Tamrielic pantheons.
And even amongst those three Daedra his worship is much more hidden, whereas
theirs is popular and well-known. Despite this cults established in his name can
be found in every province of Tamriel if one knows where to look.

Also known by the monikers of Taskmaster, Blighted Lord, Conjurer of Contagions
and Caretaker of Cures, Peryite is the Daedra Prince of Tasks, Pestilence,
Cleansing, Hierarchy, and the Natural Order (Balance). He is also in charge of
keeping the Lesser Denizens of Oblivion in line and in their place, making him
unique amongst his fellow Princes as he seems to be the only one who invests
time monitoring the incalculable planes of Oblivion – including the ones
controlled by the other Daedra Lords. Because of this he is often unconcerned
with (or simply does not care much about) the Mundus and the small events that
occur within it; however, he often makes his presence known to mortals in more
subtle-yet-powerful ways and only becomes interested in Nirn when grand events
occur or when a mortal invokes him directly.

When he does materialize on Nirn he almost always takes on the form of a green
four-limbed dragon, serpentine in appearance and unlike the fabled dragons of
Skyrim and Akavir. He may also take on the form of infectious vermin, an eerie
alchemist of unspecified race, a winged snake, or a calming voice inside your
mind. His emblem is that of a limbed snake with wings, which is believed to
symbolize harmony between the heavens and the earth.

Whereas some of the other Princes neonymics (the names they created/chose for
mortals to refer to them as) are translatable (for example, “Molag Bal” means
“Fire Stone” in Ehlnofex as well as the Mer dialects that evolved from it), it
is still a mystery why the Taskmaster chose Peryite as his. It is similar in
nature to the Ayleid word *pyrite* (“harmony”) and the Nedic word *pryit* (“to
seep”). The word *peryite* (“balance corrupting”) itself is a Nordic word,
dating back to the First Era around the creation of the Alessian Empire and very
similar to *pyrite* and *pryit*. Because of this some theorists suggest that
“Peryite” is an accidental amalgamation of those words created by Nordic
travelers who spoke with both races during their early interactions with the
Heartlands. Eventually the new word became the standard name for the Prince
after men’s permanence in Cyrodiil was secured so that negotiations with the
First Empire of the Nords would run smoothly. However, that is all speculation
and Peryite himself seems to treat the name as if it is just as ancient as he
is. Of course, like the rest of the Daedra Princes, the Taskmaster’s protonymic
is unknown.

Although it is widely known that the Daedric Princes have no true understanding
of the concepts of “good” and “evil” Peryite (along with his brethren Boethiah,
Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Vaermina) is considered to be genuinely
destructive on purpose and takes pleasure in the suffering he inflicts on
mortals. Many consider this label to be somewhat inaccurate when considering the
nature of Peryite’s ur-sphere, balance. He makes sure that all opposing forces
in a system also have opposing forces moving against them, as well as making
sure that everything in said system has a purpose. He embodies both the good and
the bad about every individual thing in the Aurbis and therefore always chooses
to play both sides of an argument during dealings; many of his blessings are
also curses due to his constant duality. Because of this Peryite is considered
one of the most malicious and deadly Princes, owing to the fact that he is fully
aware about the sadistic things he does to mortals but commits them anyway. The
truth behind the matter is simply that the Blighted Lord has a great chance at
harming you as well as helping you during dealings with him.

The earliest mention of Peryite in Tamrielic traditions appears in the ancient
Nedic text known as *Draconis Peryedeythos*, which is still being translated by
scholars today. He is considered to have been a major patron deity of the Nedes
during the Merethic & First Eras by theoreticians, whose texts paint him in the
light of a god of life, death, and (most importantly) time in regards to balance
and history. Because of this he was considered a fickly deity who was both
creator and destroyer, the dreaded and the revered. All of the Nedes in Cyrodiil
(subgroups like the Keptu and the Kothringi also held him in high esteem, but
were known to have supplanted his worship with other gods) made prayer to
Peryite constantly.

It was only until the Ayleids began to systemically enslave the Nedes that
public worship of the Taskmaster began in the merish races. Due to his enigmatic
behavior and standard Elven doctrine of Aedra worship, Peryite was virtually
unknown to the Aldmer and their descendants. Exposure to Nedic religion resulted
in the Ayleids learning about and then incorporating the Blighted Lord into
their mythos. He became a symbol of their government and the city-states in
general, but many Ayleid Daedraphiles began to deeply revere him. Entire cities
like the infamous Ceylasel became devoted to Peryite. However, when Alessia
began praying for the Taskmaster to help her people against the cruel mer he
offered little existence. Eventually Alessia began to pray to another draconic
god, Auri-El, and his brood in the Ayleid Pantheon for assistance in
overthrowing the slave-masters. The Divines heard her prayers and took pity on
the girl, sending her three visions as well as the help of the Ada Morihaus the
Man-Bull. Alessia was able to free herself and launched the infamous Alessian
Slave Rebellion.

The more Aedra-aligned Ayleid lords and their kingdoms allied with the Nede
uprising and its newfound Nordic supporters to help defeat their Daedra
worshipping brethren in what is known as the Narfinsel Schism. Cities dedicated
to the Princes were razed and destroyed; some even disappeared from the land
entirely. In the end, the Nedes won against their former masters and drove all
of the hostile Ayleids out of Cyrodiil. With the installation of the Eight
Divines (a fusion of the Aldmeri and Nordic pantheons) and the subsequent public
banning of Daedra Worship, Akatosh Time-Father became the new dragon god of the
Nedic people and Peryite was displaced. Despite this, many Taskmaster cults
persisted throughout ancient Cyrodiil (some scholars even suggest that the
statues of Akatosh that can be found throughout the Heartlands were based on
early depictions of Peryite) and eventually found themselves in the other eight
provinces.

In Skyrim, the Nords regarded Peryite as a nature demon and harbinger of death.
In their legends he is the one that first brought sickness to the land of snow
and made it harder for them to grow food. This seems appropriate for the Nords,
who often harbor fear and resentment against dragons (see: Alduin). However,
dragons are also seen as symbols of power and authority in the Fatherland and
thus the Nordic cults respected the more orderly aspects of Peryite. Draconic
totems created in honor of Peryite were fusions of the remnants of the Dragon
Cult and Nibenese customs from Cyrodiil, and were especially profound in the
Reach. According to fable, Peryite transformed a disrespectful worshipper who
forsook him for the goddess Kyne into a sickly tree in that region and till this
day it remains a constant reminder to those that would wish to betray the
Taskmaster. The tree then became his chief shrine in Skyrim.

Peryite’s worship found its way to High Rock through the Reachmen, a group of
tribal Bretons that have plagued both Skyrim and High Rock for centuries.
Capturing and intermingling with Peryite cultists resulted in the already Daedra
worshippers to incorporate him into their evil pantheon of dark demons and hedge
spirits as *Paerite*. He became a spirit associated with curing agents and deadly
alchemic brews. Paerite also allegedly helped them create what is to believe to
be some sort of “plague magic” to waste away their enemies. The more civilized
Bretons began to revile the Taskmaster for these reasons, but he remains a
popular deity amongst the healers, witches, and warlocks and is often referred
to as the “Alchemist’s God” in their province.

Interestingly, Peryite seems to have always been involved in the region of
Hammerfell. The Keptu there viewed him as a kindly demon, and there have always
been speculation that the Blighted Lord is connected with the estranged Rourken
Clan of the Dwemer. When the Yokudans came forth in their Ra Gada Wave they
began to mindlessly slaughter all the folk that lived in ancient Hammerfell to
make way for their fleeing people. As a result Nedic-style Peryite worship was
all but stamped out. However, the Redguards brought with them their own pantheon
and cultural practices. In Yokudan faith Peryite is known as *Pe’erite*, the god
of Banes and Cleansing. In myth he was the one that taught the Redguards how to
kill scorpions and use their venom for poison and how to use cacti as a healing
agent; in short, he taught them the basics of alchemy. This cemented him as both
a god of healers and warriors, but a minor one in both areas.

Similar to the Nords of Skyrim, the Bosmer of Valenwood view Peryite as an
equally malevolent and benevolent nature spirit. In the jungle nation he is
referred to as *Rite* (which translates into “The Pear-You-Eat”) and is a much
more obscure deity that seems to be on a much higher cosmic order. Rite is
closely associated with Y’ffre the Spirit of the Now, and ancient Bosmeri
legends indicate he embodies the civilized Merish traits and the more bestial
habits of the Wood Elves. His niche of the Natural Order is held in high esteem
in his Valenwood cults, and his sphere of pestilence is interestingly neglected.
As “Warden of the Ooze”, he judges whether a Bosmer maintains their form or
sinks back into the formlessness of the Dawn Era. Ayleid refugees from Cyrodiil
also brought their *Pyrite* to Valenwood when the Wood Elves gave them shelter
from the Alessians, but his worship only prevailed in their cities and died out
when they did.

Fleeing Ayleids also brought Pyrite to the Summerset Isles when they attempted –
and succeeded – to integrate back into Altmer society. Due to the High Elves
disdain for Daedra worship, his cults are minimal in the isles (especially due
to how they believe his draconic image is a mockery of Auri-El’s majesty).
However, the more open-minded Altmer view him as a “Societal God” who’s in
charge of their incredible caste system.

The Khajiit of Elsweyr were introduced to Peryite worship (in his aspect of
Rite) by their neighbors the Bosmer at some unknown time in the past, but many
suggest that is during the Merethic Era. In Khajiiti legend his name is *Perjit*
in Ta’agra’iss, one of the many children of Fadomai and Ahnurr’s second litter.
He is the Herbal Cat for “who can smell the differences between healing spices
and poisonous plants better than a cat?”. A minor deity, Perjit seems to be a
god of both alchemy and cookery. He is also tied to the making of skooma out of
moon sugar, resulting in him being interestingly connected to
Sheggorath/Sheogorath (and therefore insanity). Khajiit believe that cooks and
alchemists are often driven crazy by their work, which can be stressful and
tedious.

Although the Argonians as a whole do not worship neither Aedra or Daedra
(instead choosing to revere the spore-trees known as the Hist and the great
nothingness called Sithis) the individuals that assimilate themselves into the
other provinces are fully capable of doing so. Instead, Peryite worship instead
was centralized in Kothringi and Barsaebic Ayleid beliefs. However, with the
extinction of both of those races the worship of the Taskmaster has become
scarce in the province.

The Dunmer of Morrowind have an interesting view on Peryite. He was one of the
ancient spirits that accompanied the Chimer during the Velothi Exodus, but was
always a more lesser known (albeit still respected) deity compared to Boethiah,
Azura, and Mephala. When the Tribunal came to power during the First Era, they
gave counsel and admonishment to the Daedric Princes. Some (like the Three Good
Daedra) complied with the will of the Living Gods, while others (like the House
of Troubles) rebelled. Peryite, admiring but at the same feeling disrespected by
the Dunmeri people, simply chose not to redraw from the Land of the Dark Elves
entirely. Of course over the years several Peryite cults have settled in
mainland Morrowind and on the island of Vvardenfell (even building Daedric
shrines to him) due to the natives open-mindedness towards Daedra, but they
almost immediately dissolved due to the Taskmaster’s intentional and complete
disregard for the region.

But out of all the provinces that revere the Blighted Lord, Cyrodiil has done it
the longest and is the originator of it. As earlier in this book, the native
Nedes worshipped the Daedric Prince as one of the chief deities in their
animalistic pantheon, *Pryit*. Their ancient texts state that Pryit is one of
the oldest gods, forming immediately after the Time God (mannish Akatosh or
merish Auri-El) came into existence to help balance the Aurbis. Because of this
the Nedes viewed Pryit as a much more important entity who often took on a
draconic image to show his connection to time. His worship only began to wane
during the Alessian Rebellion and the beginning of the Alessian Empire, due to
Akatosh becoming the chief god of the Eight Divines. Daedric cults began to be
persecuted throughout Cyrodiil, but many Nedes refused to give up their worship
of the Taskmaster. As the modern Imperial race began to emerge, veneration of
the Prince of Pestilence altered between the cultures of Colovia and Nibenay.
The Colovians viewed Peryite as more of a god of order and workers, harsh and
strict. The Nibenese viewed Peryite in a nicer light as a god of alchemy and
scholars. Regardless, reverence for the Taskmaster suffered during the time of
the Alessian Order due to their advocation of monotheism and the anti-Daedra
message of the Eight Divines forced his worshippers to live in areas of
seclusion. Those that explore the Heartlands however may come across some of the
rare statues of Peryite in the wilderness, abandoned and in disrepair.

Certain vampire clans revere Peryite as a patron throughout Tamriel. This is
undeniably true for the Whet Fang of Argonia, who are one of the more elusive
and powerful clans. This stretches back to Merethic Era legends where it is
stated that Peryite was enraged at Molag Bal for creating vampirism, which
upsets the balance between mortal life and death. In an attempt to eradicate the
condition, he cursed the spreading vampirism. Only the Whet Fang bloodline were
affected by the curse, creating the vampire strain *Serratus Peryiphim*, also
known as *Serratus Peryiphim Sanguis*. In the end, Peryite took ultimate
vengeance upon Molag Bal by diluting the vampiric condition from a magical
infliction into a parasitic disease of which he has taken control. Peryite is
also said to have some rivalry with Hircine, who also disturbed the balance
between man and beast with lycanthropy.

It is unknown if the other peoples of Tamriel (the Imga, Orcs, etc.) venerate
Peryite in some form or fashion. It is often speculated that the Sload of Thras
recognize and make dealings with him, with one such dealing being the disastrous
Thrassian Plague (this, however, has yet to be confirmed).

A common – but major – misconception is that Peryite is one of the weakest of
the Daedric Princes. There is no true way to calculate the power of a god,
especially the infinite strength and total immortality of the Daedra. But in
some regards he can be seen as weak; for example, compared to the other sixteen
Princes he seems ultimately unconcerned with Nirn. As stated earlier, however,
his attentions are invested in making sure the Daedric common folk are doing
what they are supposed to be doing. Despite this, he still makes time to observe
mortals in the Mundus and spread his influence in both beneficial and hurtful
ways. It is said that Peryite is constantly watching every being in the Aurbis,
making sure that they are doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing.
Those that have been able to communicate with the Blighted Lord and remain in a
communicative state have said that he always greets the individual politely
before telling them that he has been observing them for some time. Because of
this, he is often able to pick out individuals to perform certain tasks for him.

Persecutors of Peryite worshippers are often priests of Akatosh, Arkay, and
Zenithar, and the Taskmaster does seem to hold some contempt for those three
Aedra. Peryite-Akatosh aggression dates back to the beginning of the First Era.
The Taskmaster’s spheres of pestilence and cleansing often interfere with
Arkay’s control of life and death. And Zenithar’s domain of work and commerce
overlap with Peryite’s need for tasks and balance. His rivals in Oblivion
include Molag Bal, Hircine, Mephala and Vaermina, the former two for the reasons
mentioned earlier in this volume and the latter two for reasons still unknown to
mortals. And the holy god-knight Ebonarm hates all Daedra.

Peryite’s holdings in Oblivion is known as the Pits (or Peryite’s Pits), which
has always been inaccessible to living mortals since recorded history. The only
knowledge of them comes from the accounts of other Daedra and the spirits of the
dead that resided there, for you have to be deceased in order to enter the Pits.
The Pits are described as a craggy, rocky wasteland of a dark-grey hue and an
eternally nighttime sky. But the most interesting thing about the realm is that
the ground is littered with thousands of holes, each one built specifically for
a certain purpose. Waterfalls of pure water and infectious ooze flow equally
throughout the realm and green lightning strikes frequently. Few vegetation
grows in the ground, but those that do are unique. The realm itself is prone to
violent dust storms that can rip flesh from bone as well as healing rain. Most
inhabitants of the realm reside in the many pits, leaving the surface to the
more bestial Daedra. Peryite himself exists in all areas of his realm, his body
curving in and out of tunnels linking the pits together. The majority of his
body – including his forearms and head – resides in the Palace of Parity, his
center of power in the Pits.

Unlike the other Daedric Princes, Peryite does not employ Dremora in his service
as he finds them rowdy and disrespectful. Instead the unique Daedra known as
Vavasours perform the duties the aforementioned Dremora, and are bound to his
will and his will only for eternity. There are both male and female Vavasours,
with both sexes being of a height of seven feet, slim build, and wearing light
green medium armor of an unknown fluid-like substance. Their skin is an eerie
pale, their eyes bright yellow with no pupils, and their hair a dark green,
resulting in them being more humanoid than most Daedra. Vavasours are in charge
of maintaining order throughout the infinite parts of Peryite’s realm and work
the vassals (mortal worshippers or lesser Daedra who perform mundane tasks) in
the pits. Another type of unique Daedra supposedly encountered in the Pits is
the Plague Atronach, which are loyal only to Peryite.

Something interesting to note is that Peryite is in default control of an
unknown number of Daedric planes, as he orders all of the lowest orders of
Oblivion. Some of these he has incorporated into his realm or simply conquered,
like the Blighted Nexus, home plane of the Plague Atronachs. He has also formed
planes in Oblivion either for his followers or out of his anger (which is
something to behold, for the Blighted Lord is always described as calm and
calculating), like the Oozing Mire.

Peryite’s summoning day is the 9th of Rain’s Hand, the time of the year where
his influence is strongest on Nirn. It is said that on this day he first spread
disease throughout Tamriel, shortening the unnaturally long lives of man, mer,
and beastfolk. Illness and vermin become rampant throughout Tamriel as the
Taskmaster draws closer to the Mundus. In order to summon him one needs vampire
dust, a flawless ruby, a silver ingot, a deathbell flower, and of course either
a shrine to the Prince of Pestilence or a sigil of his power. However, it is
said that those who are deathly ill or able to contact Peryite at any time of
the year and some areas of Nirn surge with his energy.

The end of this volume will now speak of Spellbreaker, Peryite’s signature
artifact and one of the most ancient relics of Tamriel. Superficially a tower
shield of Dwemeri make, it is invested with vast portions of the Taskmaster’s
power. The shield has the ability to block both melee and magical attacks,
befitting its true master’s sphere. It played a crucial war during the battle
between the Rourken Clan and the Archmage Shalidor before it became the shield
of heroes. Some say that the Rourken built it for Peryite after he sent a
wasting plague to the Dwemer for some insult. Others believe that he stole the
shield once the Dwemer disappeared from this world. And some of the wilder
theories state that Shalidor was a champion of the Taskmaster, who tricked the
Rourken into creating the shield and the battle started when they learned of
this betrayal. Regardless, it is one of the most sought after Daedric artifacts
amongst warriors and mages both. Interestingly, however, it hasn’t been seen in
Tamriel for many years. Perhaps Peryite has withdrawn it for use temporary, as
his attentions stray elsewhere.
