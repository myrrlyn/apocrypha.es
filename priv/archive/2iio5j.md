Ysgramor was born in the fertile lands of Atmora, the son of a wealthy wasabi
plantation owner, he spent his youth learning to hunt, to build great structures
of stone, to sail ships, and the many oral traditions of the men of Atmora, both
the skaldic arts and the Gifts of Kyne. When he was a young man he piloted pack
whales, carrying wasabi shipments above the rainforests that covered much of the
continent at the time, where he learned the arts of the axe and shield to defend
his caravans. His father inducted him into the Dragon Cult as a young man, and
he quickly became influential as an aristocrat. He inherited his father’s
plantation at the young age of two hundred and seven, where he soon had two
sons, Yngol and Ylgar. It was when his sons had become men all their own when
the Sea Serpents attacked Atmora in their first concerted effort, the
nullification of the first wave of Serpents cost the whole of Atmora five
hundred years, this loss of years caused a split in the population of Atmora,
those who were angered at the loss of so many years argued that men should not
sacrifice so much, that it was Ald that caused Alduin to hunt the Seas, and so
Ald and his mer should sacrifice their ages to combat the Devourer; that parties
should be sent to capture elves to sacrifice to nullify the Hungers of Shor, but
those sympathetic to the Cult of the Coming Dragon Savior and its Dragon Priests
knew that the only option was to continue the nullifications until the plans of
the Eastern Prophet could be fulfilled. The bickering only lasted a few months
before the first winter came to Atmora, and the next spring the rainforests had
become forests filled with oaks and firs, affected by autumn. And Ysgramor’s
wasabi no longer grew. Ysgramor, fearing the loss of his wealth, and the further
destruction of Atmora, visited the Dragon Priests.

“Konahrik, please, my farms are all dried, and my servants will go hungry,
surely you can do something, surely you do not mean for us to sit as our years
are stolen by Orkey and used to kill the Serpents, surely you do not mean for
Atmora to age until it is forever aged and we all starve.” Spoke Ysgramor as he
paced about the office of the High Priest.

“Ysgramor, old friend, you know as well as I do that we must wait for the
Shorson to Starfall, and for the Winged one to return, for they will usher in
the Dragons, who will consume the Serpents and Eagles. Have faith in the
Prophet, the Tiger whose Voice was stronger that all others. By his Kiai please
have patience…”

“Patience! For what? I am doomed already, what will I have in a year’s time? My
wasabi does not grow, and all other crops are too cheap to sustain my distance
from the cities. Do not tell me to be patient as I face starvation, at least
give me some promise of food, and of further life, then I will calm, then I will
have patience in my faith to the Dragon!”

“Fine then, I have need of a scouting party on Mereth, where well will make our
Dragon come forth, where we will do battle with the Eagles and Serpents, I will
send you there. Gather your servants and family, I will distract the Maw of
Shor, that you may cross the Sea of Ghosts safely, send scryings of any news you
learn, but do not anger the mer, for I have no use for a dead friend an ocean
away. I will tell the unbelievers that you are going to capture elves for
sacrifice, that I may make peace on this continent.”

And so Ysgramor gathered his servants and sons in the city of Jylkurfyk, where
many ships awaited him. And as they sailed out they saw the great navy preparing
the distraction, and that night Atmora lost five hundred more years, and six
thousand men perished, and Ysgramor yet lived. Ysgramor landed on Mereth where
he set up a small camp, and began scouting this strange new place. He saw elven
strongholds made of ice, and at their cores were swirling magics, which
contained the age of the surrounding land, and the lives of human slaves. And
the scouts saw Serpents clash into the ice of these strongholds, and they dashed
themselves upon the walls and were negated. And Ysgramor contacted giants and
befriended them and taught them of the Dragon Cult, and of the Bull and of the
Shorson, and he snuck into the city and spoke with the slaves, who called
themselves Nedes, and learned about the elves, and Ysgramor learned of written
language, and he recorded all he knew in this new medium. And all was well with
Ysgramor when he began to cough fire, after much scrying by the wizards they had
realized that something deep in the earth was calling out to them. And so
Ysgramor had the area excavated and he built a city out of the stone brought
forth, and that city was named Saarthal. And they eventually uncovered a sphere
covered in runes. And Dumb Old Giant was chosen to approach the sphere, and he
was enveloped by the thing, and greeted by a vision of an elven woman who asked
him what he wanted of her, and he asked who she was.

“I am Kinmune, how can I help you?”

“what are you?”

“I am Kinmune, or Kinetically-Interlinked Nirnian Multi-User Exoform a limited
sentience deep-pressure capable thot-box.”

“Where are you from?”

“I am from the breath rigs of Kynareth.”

“Kyne?”

“PROCESSING… Yes Kyne, the Atmoran name, is a suitable name for the Plane(t) on
which I was stationed around.”

“Do you know then of the Bull and of the Shorson?”

“PROCESSING… the Bull may refer to the &lt;error redacted information&gt; myth
of Morihaus, and Shorson refers to the Shezzarines. Which do you seek
information on?”

“The Starfall’n!”

“PROCESSING… &lt;error temporal anomaly&gt;&lt;attempting data refresh&gt; …

entity confusion&gt; &lt;error 637 Akasoul&gt;&lt;error 524 Shezarine&gt; …
KINMUNE recommends unrepulsing the impossipoint designated PELINAL to Nirn to
reestablish Space-Time.”

“umm. What?”

“Just say yes you Big Dumb Giant.”

“Eh, Why Not.”

“&lt;Charging unrepuling beam&gt;&lt;firing beam&gt;&lt;impossipoint
falling&gt;”

“Can I go now?”

“WARNING, interface with KINMUNE causes loss of Liquid State Memory,
disconnection will shed Animus and cause Big Dumbness.”

“Umm. Okay… Bye.”

“Sorry. Goodbye.”

And at that the giant left the machine and pissed his pants.

“Big Dumb!” shouted Ysgramor, who had become good friends with the giant over
the months on Mereth, ran to his friend as he collapsed. “What happened?” “I
talk to pretty lady, she make Starman come, bye bye friend…” talked Big Dumb as
he slipped into a Big Dumb Coma. At the sight of his friend’s undoing Ysgramor
ordered his men to destroy the sphere. After a week of shouts, and the use of
relics and wasabi enchanted weapons, and wasabi eating contests, and after
stealing Dwemeri machines and putting them into random configurations, the men
trapped Kinmune under Saarthal. And after one more week a light appeared over
Saarthal. And the Elven King Auriel sent his Snow Elven army to take Saarthal
after the Censurs visited him and told of a Temporal Anomaly in the human
settlement. And the Elven army attacked Saarthal suddenly in the night, and
Eagles came and swallowed up many men.

And Ysgramor in his anger over the loss of Big Dumb fought bravely. And as the
battle raged on the light grew closer and closer, and the fighting slowed as all
looked up to see a naked man falling from the sky. And when he was about two
hundred feet from the ground he was swallowed by an Eagle, who perched on the
battlements and chortled at the men below, “Behold men, We have swallowed your
Shouldn’t Be Here frie…” and halfway through the word friend a beam of light
shot from the chest of the Eagle and the man jumped from its stomach, and before
he landed on the ground he had killed six more Eagles. And the Crazed Man yelled
to Ysgramor telling him to run for reinforcements, and to bring him his armor.

And Ysgramor ran, and his sons followed, and they returned to Atmora, and they
saw many Serpents fly towards Mereth, to fight the Eagles. And Ysgramor and sons
arrived in Atmora. And they wept, for the once rainforested fatherland was now
covered in snow, and pines sprouted all around. And Ysgramor went into the city
of Jylkurfyk, and told of the elves and of the return of the Starfallen, and was
quickly ushered into the Temple.

“Ysgramor, surely you are a bringer of the Savior, Oh Ysgramor, you shall bear
the title of a Dragon, Ysmir, come. Come. We must speak with haste.” Said the
High Priest. “We must strike back at the elves, we must gather, and fight, and
make way for the Dragon!” yelled Ysgramor. “Yes! Yes! Ysgramor, take the gift of
the Tiger, for he gave us an armory, one piece from each Totemic Star, and give
these gifts to the Shorson. Go Priests, gather who little we have left, take my
Mask, my Identity and hide it in Mereth outside of time, for I will stay behind
and make way. I will use Orkey one last time, and Atmora will use her last years
to make way for you, go, and Ice will cover this place, and all of time will
pass here, and we will freeze in place. Go and know you cannot return.” Spoke
the High Priest. And so the Atmorans gathered in Jylkurfyk, and of those left in
Atmora the strong boarded boats, and set off, and they numbered five hundred
captains, five hundred ships. And they left behind many sick, and young, and
babes, and old. And halfway through the voyage Atmora gave her last years, and
the Sea upheaved, and many of the Eagles fell into the sea, and the Serpents
fled to the deep, and a storm brewed, and when the ships landed Ysgramor grew
angry, for his sons had not arrived, and were separated by the storm, and so
Ysgramor sailed out alone, and he saw ship Darumzu, and knew Ylgar and his wife
Adrimk were safe, and he sailed longer, until he knew his son lied below, and he
shouted at the sea, until the ocean waters oozed and congealed in ectoplasm, and
the sea ghosts whipped up, and Ysgramor demanded his son’s body, and Yrgramor
delivered his son to the shores of Mereth, where he built a barrow for his son,
and Ysgramor and his companions attacked the elves where they found them, and
Pelinal visited Ysgramor and took his armor, and took leave. And Ysgramor
gathered his captains and lead war against the elves, and they destroyed the
cities of the elves, and freed the Nedes and destroyed the Age Magics, and with
each Age bubble burst a wave of Existence came upon the Serpents and repelled
them, and the waves of existence overloaded the Eagles and Skyrim was cleared of
the foul Beasts for hundreds of years, but the Atmorans lost their old age, and
the ages of men from then on numbered but one hundred. And the Atmorans settled
Skyrim, and they bore children with the Nedes, and birthed the Nords, and drove
the elves from Skyrim. And man built his first empire on Tamriel. And they
praised the Akatusk, and they praised the Starfallen, and they praised Ysmir,
and Ysgramor, and Shor, and awaited the return of the Bull, and awaited the
return of the Shorson now called Pelinal.
