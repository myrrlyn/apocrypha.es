First Emissary Elenwen,

I fear we have a disturbing situation that has arisen in light of the dragon
attack on Helgen. While the attack prevented the execution of Ulfric Stormcloak
and will help to further our goals as the civil war continues, I’m afraid there
is another matter. No doubt all of the Skyrim shook when the Greybeards called
the name “Dovahkiin” It has been several weeks since this event took place, but
now it seems our perceptions of these so called “Dragonborn” may have been
premature. If I may quote our esteemed leadership in Alinor, “The Ysmir line is
dead and so is His stranglehold on the mythic.” This has seemed to have been the
case in wake of the ending of the Oblivion Crisis and with the Septim line
ended. All this extended from Talos, the pretender, who was called Ysmir by the
Greybeards if the stories and boasts of bards are to believed. We are now trying
to purge him from the mythic, in doing so we erase Doom Drum’s iniquity and all
of his traces. The recent call of the Greybeards has shaken this faith. Our best
sources had reported to me that the Greybeards call was directed at a prisoner
who escaped execution in Helgen. Who this individual is we have yet to
ascertain, but what follows is the most disturbing news. The prisoner answered
the Greybeard summons and proceeded in their initiation. We have it on good
authority that the Greybeards have accepted this individual and have hailed them
as Ysmir! This was not foreseen and represents the greatest living threat to our
plans to date. Ysmir represents a symbol hope for the races of Man. It is
essential that we locate this individual and terminate them with extreme
prejudice. There is no doubt that they will start growing in power, and their
connection to Talos and Doom Drum is undeniable. I will continue to monitor this
situation and send you all available information so that we might dispatch them.
