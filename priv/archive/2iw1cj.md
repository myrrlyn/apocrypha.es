First Emissary Elenwen,

More information has arisen on the individual we now know as the Dragonborn, or
Ysmir. As if it wasn’t enough that they were officially hailed by the
Greybeards, it now appears that they are collaborating if not working for the
remanets of the Blades. While the Blades no longer exist in anything but name, a
few members of this heretical order have escaped justice and appear to be hiding
in Skyrim. This cult aligned itself more closely with Talos later in the Third
Era but suffered after they lost funding and support from an Emperor who was not
dragonborn, and whom they did not officially support themselves. Their meddling
in our affairs was another reason they were hunted down with such gusto here in
the Dominion before the Great War. I digress though, this subject is well known
to you, First Emissary. (Also I will see to it personally that those guards who
were not killed during the raid on your soiree will be punished severely for
their negligence for allowing the Blades to infiltrate our Embassy, we also
mourn the passing of 3rd Emissary Rulindil.)

However the new information that has been brought back is frustrating. It
appears that our Justicars dispatched to the Ratway failed to capture the Blade
member Esbern before he escaped with the Dragonborn. We have now lost track of
both of these fugitives after they escaped from Riften. It is at your discretion
but I recommend your agent Shavari wait in Riften in case the Dragonborn is
foolish enough to return. We rue this loss for the moment because Esbern was
possibly our best source of information on the return of the dragons. For the
time being we will keep piecing together the available lore from Cloud Ruler
Temple. We will also not cease in our efforts to hunt for these heretics.
Information from our various sources and prisoners also hint that former Blade
Delphine may be behind these recent coups against us, I will send her dossier
with this letter in case you wish to review it. In the meantime I will spare no
expense in terminating these threats.

—Erraille 4th Emissary
