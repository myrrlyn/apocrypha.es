_From the Office of Alandro Sul, Warking of New Resdayn_

The TRAITOR still walks and lives and breathes.

He poisons another world with his lies while our one lays dying.

He left to selfishly build himself an empire, to impose his will on others, to
run away from the SHAME and EVIL that he committed beneath Red Mountain.

Now as the Corprus Horde creeps further towards Mournhold, we are left with no
other choice. The Psjiics have agreed to lend us their power for they see that
the Corprus Horde cannot be stopped. We will travel to the OTHER world, the
other Possibility. We will find the TRAITOR and we will destroy him.

Alandro Sul, No Longer Warking In This World stared in disbelief at the scene
before him. They were too late. The Psjiic mumbled Hard Mathematics to himself
even as the Tribunal walked towards them, newly Ascended.

“I thought we were supposed to come here before the event!” yelled Alandro,
looking at the Psjiic.

“I…impossible..I must have..no, I made it very clear…we” mumbled the Psjiic.

_A God can do many things, mage_ spoke Vivec, his voice a sickening majesty.

**YOUR CALCULATIONS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO CHANGE** spoke Sotha Sil

“Too late as always, Alandro” spoke Almalexia.

Alandro felt a cold rage overtake him and he drew Keening from its scabbard,
running past the Tribunal towards the Heart. Surprisingly, they parted and made
way for Alandro, who, despite the strange actions from the Tribunal managed to
keep on running.

Alandro drew Sunder and jumped at the Heart, ready to deliver justice. He came
close to the heart, Keening barely a few inches away from it but he stood there.
In the air. Floating like a fly in molasses.

Vivec appeared before him and gently lowered him until he was laying
spread-eagled on the ground, unable to move. Alandro heard the scream of the
Psjiic, suddenly cut short.

_What would your dear friend Nerevar think? Is this your way to avenge his
death?_ spoke Vivec in a mocking, paternalistic tone.

Vivec placed his hand on Alandros forehead and Alandro saw what had happened in
this Possibility. He saw Dagoth Ur deliver the killing blow. He saw Almalexia
weep crocodile tears in front of the Chimer, telling them the news of the
Nerevars death. He saw Vivec’s sickening smile as he held the Nerevars body
close.

Alandro screamed in a supreme gesture of futile rage.

Oh my poor, poor husband spoke Almalexia

**I AM TRULY SORRY IT HAD TO COME TO THIS** spoke Sotha Sil

_I will grant you a mercy, Alandro. I will spare your life. But before I let you
go…_

Vivec crumbled Wraithguard, Keening and Sunder right before Alandros eyes,
collecting the dust in his hands. He blew and Alandro felt a cool wind pass over
him.

Alandro awoke, coughing and spluttering. Ash had coated his throat and the
inside of his nose. He crawled to a small lake and dunked his head. He emerged
and looked out around him. Nothing but grey, ashen wastes. He saw a small hill
and on it were two Ashlanders, clad in long robes, watching him from a distance.
