First Emissary Elenwen,

I have dire news, the rumors that the Dragonborn has journeyed to Solstheim have
been proven true. Ancarion and his expedition team have gone dark, they were
sent to the island in the hopes of learning the secrets of forging stalhrim from
the Skaal by any means necessary. The last word we received from Ancarion was
that they had abducted the Skaal’s blacksmith and was interrogating him for the
information. After this, nothing, we have not heard word from them for several
weeks. Along with trying to obtain the smithing secrets, they were also our only
eyes and ears on Solstheim. I have not been able to muster the forces to travel
to the island due to its remoteness and our previous lack of significant
interest.

This was a mistake though, and our folly was allowing the Dragonborn to travel
there in the first place. They have now returned to Skyrim proper and I fear
that they have grown even more powerful. We have only heard whispers and
unsubstantiated rumors but from what Ancarion elaborated in his missives was
that the whole island had come under the influence of one called Miraak. Though
Ancarion had little idea of who this figure was, it didn’t interfere with his
mission and he heeded it little attention. We should have had more substantial
forces in place on the island as soon as we learned the Dragonborn had sought
passage. From what little information I can piece together, I believe the
Dragonborn traveled there to confront this Miraak. Now how this transpired is
not known to me, after the last missives from the expedition team, we have only
rumors and conjecture to stand on.

What is known to us now is that the Dragonborn has returned and they are flushed
with new power. My scouts report watching them use their Voice to literally bend
the will of a group of bandits so that they immediately turned on their
comrades. It appears he can also now be seen as the aspect of a dragon, this is
troublesome sign because Nordic myth has similar stories of people not being
able to look upon Ysmir without seeing a dragon. There is no doubt now that the
Dragonborn is literally Ysmir come again. The final and most disturbing reports
are the sightings of the Dragonborn enter battle with a dragon, but instead of
killing the wyrm, use their Voice to tame the beast and then ride upon it! First
Emissary, my faith has been shaken that we can now stop Ysmir, he has slew
dozens of dragons and gains power with each one, now he has returned with the
power to literally bend and reshape the very rock to his will. I beseech you, we
have failed up to this point, and now I fear it is too late to stop this rising
tide.

A Letter to all Thalmor Justicars,

The position of 3rd Emissary is vacant once again, I will select worthy
candidates from among you. Erraille has been sent back to Alinor for punishment
and re education. A reminder to you all, do not fail me.

By my hand and seal,

Elenwen
