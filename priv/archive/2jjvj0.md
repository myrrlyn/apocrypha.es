For the eyes of the Thalmor and our allies.

It’s obvious something catastrophic has happened. Yesterday, around noon, an
event happened that has never been observed anywhere in Tamriel. If you did not
witness the initial incident, we all witnessed the after effect. The sun itself
was blotted out by a reddish orb that seemed to block all light. The land was
cast into a darkness that persisted until around seven in the evening. The sky
then cleared and returned to its usual state. The importance of this event
cannot be overstated. Someone has found the power to literally block the power
of Magnus from reaching Nirn. This is an immense power and cannot be tolerated
in anyone else’s hands. From our available information at this time, we believe
this is related to the sudden rise of the Volkihar vampire clan. This seems to
fit the events, who else benefits more from a world that is shielded from the
magic’s of Aetherius? Our agents also report a sudden increase in vampire
attacks on towns and in the countryside as the darkness set in.

Our lore masters have brought to our attention an ancient prophecy (originating
from the Elder Scrolls) that the vampires may have learned of and may be acting
to complete it. The so called “Tyranny of the Sun” hints at a time when the sun
itself will be blotted out and the land be plunged into darkness, this seems to
describe the event that transpired yesterday. Our mages have asked themselves,
what could be used to achieve such an potent and lasting effect? They think they
have the answer: Auriel’s Bow. With its connection to Aetherius and Auriel its
the only known weapon that could be used, or corrupted, to achieve the darkness
that covered the land yesterday.

Now some of our informants and Justicars have reported seeing another unusual
happenstance; the sun seeming to literally flare up and send down rays of light
to strike areas in Skyrim. No one as of yet has been able to see what those rays
were striking or what was causing it, but we have a suspicion that this darkness
and sudden gouts of light are connected. These are my orders to all agents,
informants and Justicars. Seek out the source of these events, find any rumor of
Auriel’s Bow within the land and if possible, located the person or group
holding it. If not, find whatever device is being used. These orders override
any current assignments you have. I demand immediate results.

By my hand and seal,

Elenwen

P.S.

Focus your attention on the Volkihar vampire clan and the Dawnguard, one of
those factions is bound to have the knowledge of these events, though they are
likely the perpetrators of it. Finally locate the Dragonborn, I have a suspicion
they’re tied up in this in someway.
