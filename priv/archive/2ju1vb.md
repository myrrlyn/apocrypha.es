Despite being damned by the same Prince, the werevultures of Vilewood are very
peculiar when compared to their other brethren.

They can achieve flight, but in a manner much different than that of a werebat.
During the transformation, the arms of the creatures grow nearly twice as long
and are supported with thick, sinewy muscle. All the digits of the hand, except
thumbs, fuse together as well. The bones hollow out and become more porous in
composition, reducing a great deal of weight, but increasing fragility; making
them worth little other than being alchemy or used as adornments, although, a
beak punch-dagger would fetch a shiny piece of gold in any khajiiti bazaar.

Despite being more delicate, they are more than capable of defending themselves.
To be as intimidating as possible, they will ruffle their feathers and spread
their large wings while letting out a guttural, almost demonic hiss. If the
attacker isn’t driven off, the werevulture will launch itself up and attack with
a razor-sharp beak and slashing talons. Should one ever attack, the best defense
is to crush the bones of the beast with a crippling blow from a warhammer or
mace, preferably to the wings or skull.

Unlike most other werebeasts; this variety doesn’t actively hunt on their own,
but in fact seeks out the dead to eat, without prejudice. Often times, they will
reveal any leftovers from another one of Hircine’s pets. Werevultures can digest
any organic matter, even a carcass tainted with basilisk venom. These habits
have imbued the creatures with the very essence of death, down to the flesh
itself. Even the dust off of the feathers can have adverse effects on one’s
stamina and lungs, as well as contain a myriad of diseases. Because of this, one
should always have a potion or healer nearby when field dressing a carcass.

This toxicity is what makes a werevulture carcass such a highly sought after
commodity by witch hunters and alchemists alike. Bones and feathers are often
ground up into a highly flammable and noxious powder, but the most valuable
parts of the beasts are the innards. Once dressed, the guts are removed and
allowed to ferment for one of the deadliest and most concentrated poisons of
Tamriel. It is believed that a single arrowhead dipped in the concoction can
kill a wood mammoth before sundown.
