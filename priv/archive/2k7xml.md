An Altmer sits at the counter. He is old, impossibly so; he could have lived to
have seen the Mythic with his own eyes. Or eye, at any rate. No eye stares forth
from his wrinkled right socket, the organ clearly being torn out in some violent
altercation. His wrinkled hands tremble as he sips his drink.

**Who are you?**

_A builder, of sorts. I prefer the term “architect”._

**What is it that you do here?**

_Drink. A lot. You start needing it when you’re as old as I am._

**Doesn’t that seem like a waste of time?**

_It doesn’t. What should I do - find a trade? Earn coins stamped with the faces
of worthless emperors? An honest worker’s just as bad as I am; he just won’t
admit it to himself, that’s all._

**What’s this about emperors?**

_Kings. Emperors. All of them, fools. They think they have power. I gave their
kind_ real _power aeons before they were torn from their mothers’ wombs, and
they squander it. Bury it underneath gold, borders and titles. Bah! If they
understood the power they had,_ truly _understood, they would cast all their
crowns and house crests into the deepest depths of the sea!_

**When was your last job?**

_Oh, that was ages ago. A king commissioned this wildly ambitious project - you
should have seen how enthusiastic he was. Got me all starry-eyed, too._

\[He takes a swig\]

_What an idiot I was. I’ll never do that again._

**What went wrong?**

_It was…a collaborative effort, at its core. A lot of hands were involved. Some
of them got misdirected. Cocky. Now it’s fallen into disrepair, and no-one
remembers the point of the whole thing anymore. No-one except me._

_It’s still standing, you know. The more I look at it, the worse I feel. I think
it’s high time someone tore it down. You young people have so many ideas
nowadays; why not use one of those?_

**What would you suggest?**

_A few young folks have good ideas from time to time, but they always end up
falling short somehow. I knew a lad in Vvardenfell…ugh, I had such high hopes
for him, but in the end he was too caught up in the local politics. People, you
know?_

_Another one, a kid from High Rock, showed more promise. As of what became of_
him*,well…*

\[He stares at the gold coins on the counter and chuckles\]
