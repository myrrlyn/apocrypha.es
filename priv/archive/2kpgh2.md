  Here’s my report on the Legion in Skyrim. Hopefully I fixed the mistakes I
  made in the Stormcloak report, but if you see any more feel free to point them
  out.

It is clear to all Justiciars and agents of the Aldmeri Dominion that this peace
between ourselves and the Third Empire is nothing more than the calm before the
storm, and a storm is coming. It is obvious that we hold the upper hand in this
peace. The Dominion was able to dictate terms to the Empire nearly identical to
those we demanded at the start of the Great War. However, we do face an
obstacle, that is the Imperial Legion. In the war we were able to smash through
their defenses due to the surprise we achieved early on in our invasion. What we
did not anticipate was how they were able to solidify and stiffen their lines in
Cyrodiil after we had taken the Imperial City. Then Lord Naarifin’s tactical
error of remaining in the city as he held his ground in the city as it was
slowly surrounded. It is clear that under a competent leader, as Titus Mede II
annoyingly proved himself to be, the Legion is still a force to be reckoned
with. Now Justicars in Skyrim will be dealing with the Fourth Legion under the
command of General Tullius.

The Fourth Legion like all Imperial Legions number about 5,000 men along with
their auxiliary units. Their ranks consist of mainly Imperials and Nords, there
are groups Redguards and Bretons in their ranks with even fewer elves. Many Orcs
are also part of the Legion and are held in high regard for their fighting
prowess. High Elf traitors are being specially marked, not only those among the
Legion but in Skyrim’s populace as well. Local recruiting has ensured that they
are at nominal strength, however that is their extent and they have received
very few reinforcements from Cyrodiil. They are trying to keep as many legions
on their border, they won’t be taken by surprise a second time. Their
headquarters is in Castle Dour in Solitude, where the General is usually to be
found. Now Thalmor agents have free reign throughout Legion command posts and
camps, and it is encouraged that you grace them with your presence from time to
time, to remind them of who is true power here. Relations with the Legion
leadership here in Skyrim are cordial at best, but both know that will not last
long. The Thalmor also retain the right to sit in on any treaties or agreements
the Empire make to make sure that the conditions of the White Gold Concordat are
upheld. The Empire grudgingly allows our Justiciars and agents to move within
their borders to root out the Talos heresy, it also affords the Thalmor
opportunities to gather intelligence on their troop movements, concentrations,
size and command structure. The Empire, of course, has no such overt measures of
reconnaissance within the borders of the Dominion. (Discussion on the Penitus
Oculatus forthcoming.)

The Legion has troops stationed in several holds including Haafingar,
Hjaalmarch, the Reach, and Falkreath. Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun has refused the
right of the Legion to quarter troops within the city, yet he also refuses to
acknowledge Ulfric’s claim to High King of Skyrim. Therefore our operations
within the hold of Whiterun are less overt. We know that in the holds that
support the Stormcloaks such the Pale, Winterhold, the Rift and Eastmarch the
Legion has several hidden camps, these are usually commanded by a Legate and are
relatively small in size. The continuing civil war benefits our agenda as
discussed at length in the report on the Stormcloaks, it must be reiterated that
we must take every measure in order to ensure that this civil war continues on
as long as possible. In keeping the Fourth Legion pinned down in Skyrim, we are
ensuring that the resources and manpower of the Empire are drained as they fight
their own subjects, distracted from their real threat.

As a broad overview, the Imperial Legions are the Dominion’s biggest obstacle in
our long term goals. That being said the loss of Hammerfell as an Imperial
province has weakened the Legion as most Redguards are embittered against the
Empires “abandonment” of them at the end of the Great War. The civil war in
Skyrim is exactly what we need to occupy the Legion and distract it from our
borders, although its likely that many eyes are still upon us in Cyrodiil. The
Dominion will not have the same element of surprise it did when we launch our
invasion in 4E 171, although our leadership in Alinor is no doubt reading new
plans that will allow us to strike again with the same surprise and cunning.

To conclude, the Thalmor have the upper hand over the Empire and its legions at
the moment. Due to the conditions of the Concordant we are able to move within
their lands with impunity and root out Talos worship, while gathering
intelligence and observations. We can continue to exploit this advantage until
the very last moment when I’m sure we shall have even bigger parts to play
within the provinces we are assigned to.

Status: Maintain the illusion of peace for the time being, gather information on
troop locations and sizes, ensure that Legion is tied down fighting the rebels
for as long as possible. Emissary Level Approval.

By my hand and seal,
