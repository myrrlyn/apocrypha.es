  These reports are winding down and I’ve saved some of my favorites for last.
  If there are any corrections I need to make just let me know. Thanks for
  everyone’s continued feedback.

  Special thanks to /u/Blackfyre87 for letting me pull references from his post
  on the Penitus Oculatus, that can be read [here](./2k413j).

After the Dominions execution of all Blades agents with our borders and then
their official disbandment at the end of the Great War, the Empire did not go on
without an intelligence organization for long. The Penitus Oculatus (which means
the Inner Eyes) formed shortly after the Oblivion Crisis as the Blades abandoned
their role as the protectors of the Emperor as the Dragonborn line came to an
end. The Penitus Oculatus, a purely Imperial organization, took over as the
Emperor’s bodyguard and protectors. They have over time added responsibilities,
and this will be discussed in length later.

Agents of the Penitus Oculatus are selected for their unwavering loyalty and
their devotion to duty. They are also known as “Specters” a shortening of their
title of Inspectors in Cyrodiil. (Perhaps they think they’re frightening
someone?) It is said their recruitment process is an especially brutal one as
initiates are asked to perform some immoral task in a test of loyalty to the
Empire. This is of course an attempt to weed out any who would falter or
hesitate in the face of adversity. Obviously these agents must be loyal to the
Emperor above all else. Their agents are spotted easily due to their uniforms
that stand out from the regular Legion armor, however not all of their agents
don this mantle.

Here in Skyrim their is only one known Penitus Oculatus command post at Dragon
Bridge southwest of Solitude. Their leader is a Commander Maro, whose own son is
serving under him (This should be exploited if the situation arises.) It appears
that the Penitus’s presence was due to a planned visit by the Emperor to Skyrim
for the wedding of a relative, this appears to have been cancelled and yet the
agents remain. However there is a suspicion that they are doing much more than
simply waiting to protect the emperor. Penitus Oculatus agents are also
infiltrators and perform counter-intelligence for the Empire. They are also
assassins and are known to kill those who are deemed a threat to the Empire.
Common opinion holds that they are hamstrung by Imperial policy in a way that
the Blades were not. I do not believe that this is the case, I have a feeling
this is only a rumor spread by the Oculatus themselves in an attempt to throw us
off their trail. They operate in secret and should be observed carefully.
There’s no doubt that their is an intelligence war transpiring between the
Thalmor and the Oculatus. We have reason to believe that they are operating
actively within Hammerfell after the signing of the Second Treaty of Stros M’Kai
in 4E 180. Their machinations appear to be extensive as they are attempting to
prod both the Forebears and the Crown factions within Hammerfell to some end we
have not ascertained yet. We also have reason to believe that their agents have
infiltrated the Dominion proper, although these must be very low scale and small
teams to have avoided our detection for sometime.

Even here in Skyrim they leave their mark. Many in the holds that support the
Stormcloaks whisper about the Imperial spies that must be in their midst, theres
no doubt the Oculatus is involved in this in some way or control the entire
network. Ulfric’s capture at Darkwater Crossing and quickly prepared execution
at Helgen reeks of their influence. I believe that Justiciars should move away
from using the Skyrim’s political ruling class for intelligence, they are too
inept to realize a proxy war is waging as they speak, we should seek other
means. The Oculatus also appears to be keening watching what is left of the Dark
Brotherhood here in Skyrim and we should allow them to operate freely against
them, our agents are spread thin as it is. We would be wise to identify each of
Penitus Oculatus agents here in Skyrim and observe their movements and whom they
talk to. Though they must have learned a lesson from the demise of the Blades,
they have proven to be very crafty and are our main rival here in Skyrim whom I
can say without hesitation, we are at war with. It has been hard to tell if they
have carried out any direct action against us due to the general chaos of the
civil war and the return of the dragons, but we shall operate against them just
as effectively and let them know who they are attempting to trifle with.

Status: **Highest** threat level, identify their agents in the province and
gather intelligence against them, prepare execution operations that can be
carried out at a moments notice. Emissary Level Approval

By my hand and seal,
