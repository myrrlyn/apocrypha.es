- To: Vindicator-General Aicantar Arana
- Turdas, 5th of Sun’s Dusk, 4E20X

Vindicator-General Aicantar Arana,

The Embassy will be prepared as order, it would be a honor and a pleasure to
entertain the Vindicator-General and your entourage here in our Embassy.

Although I must confess, this yearly review has been implemented much sooner
than usual. While our operations in Skyrim may not be moving at the pace that
the leadership in Alinor would wish, there are many variables that must be taken
into account. I hope that in your wisdom, the situation will become clear after
you visit the province.

Your humble Emissary,

Ambassador Elenwen Jororin
