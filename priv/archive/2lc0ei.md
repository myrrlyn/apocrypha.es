- To the Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold
- Middas, 9th of Sun’s Dusk, 4E 20X

Arch-Mage,

While this letter may come as a surprise, I do hope you keep your mind open with
regard to what I have to say. The Thieves Guild wishes to broker an agreement,
an alliance if you will with your college. As you may be aware, all of Skyrim
has heard about your discovery at Saarthal.

Surely you have read the same signs I have. The Thalmor will stop at nothing to
ensure they are the dominate power throughout Tamriel and will no endure any
loose ends or competition – including the teaching of arcane arts. Join with the
Thieves Guild and we can ensure Skyrim is protected against the Thalmor and
their plots and schemes. With your help, we can gain much in the way of defense,
and if we dare – attack. I look forward to your response.

Your partner in crime,

Guild Master of the Thieves Guild
