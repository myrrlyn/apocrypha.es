After the assassination of a certain Colovian baron approximately one year ago
to date, I was personally tasked with the investigation. Not an investigation
into the assassination, but further, into what may be active probing of the
Empire’s defenses by the Sea Elf kingdom. I opened several unsolved cases of
assassination across the empire for clues that may hint at Pyandonean
involvement, and have found a scarce handful of possibilities. Unsurprisingly,
all victims but our late Baron are Summerset High Elfs. I speculate that the
motivation behind our outlier lies in the fact that the baron intended to
finance a trade venture that may have benefited Pyandonean rivals on Summerset
somehow.

While perhaps comforting to think that the Sea Elfs are not deviating from their
usual modus operandi, of continual harassment of Summerset affairs, they have
not directly threatened the Empire outside of Summerset since Orgnum laid with
Potema Septim in the second century of the Third Era. Since Pyandonea is
inherently isolated from the rest of Nirn, only a scant handful of High Elf
sailors have ever laid eyes upon it. Its internal politics have only been
vaguely gleaned from the surface by their foreign policies, its language. Only
one ship has been within the veil of mist that surrounds Pyandonea and returned
from it, a Summerset Warship that, along with countless others, was ambushed in
those deadly seas. It is not wrong to say that Pyandonea is a great unknown to
the Empire. More is known of the planes of Oblivion. For these reasons I decided
early on that I must venture to this exotic land personally, and take an account
of this people and land. For the Empire and The Emperor; Tiber’s Eye sailed
south, the second ship ever to return from Pyandonea.

Tiber’s Eye was constructed in the Topal Bay, in the port of Leyawiin, custom
built to meet the harsh demands that would inevitably be placed upon it, under
the advisement of a number of commissioned High Elf and Redgaurd Shipwrights. It
is a wide vessel, that sits low in the water. Its hull, deep and sharply shaped,
is clad with steel, at great expense. They say that the waters around Pyandonea
are especially treacherous, not necessarily by rocks or sandbars, but by dense
forests of kelp that tangle oars, snag on wooden hulls, and hide deadly sea
serpents in their depths. The steel was intended to protect the vessel from
either threat, presenting a smooth, polished surface that no creature or plant
could grasp. The ship is also exclusively propelled by it’s sails for the same
reasons. Finally, it is crewed by High Elf veterans of Pyandonean conflicts, and
expert Redgaurd sailors who have been manning trade missions around the
treacherous waters of Yokuda for years. The danger inherent in this mission, to
them, was routine.

We set our sails for Pyandonea in Autumn, intending to brave foul weather for
the first part of the journey, and arrive in Pyandonea in Winter, when the
climate may be hopefully less hostile. We braved the unbelievable rain and winds
of southern ocean storms that made men remember the deaths of those that went
before, but soon the days grew shorter as the seasons shifted, and the storms
and the heat gave way to somewhat more pleasant temperatures, and long nights,
though not as long as they might have been, in Tamriel.

The First sign of our destination was the mythical veil of mist the surrounds
and defends. It appeared from a distance to be rolling clouds far on the
horizon, but as we approached we realized it was far closer than thought, and
far lower. When the ship penetrated the fog, it was like the rest of the world
ceased to be. All frames of reference vanished, and it was difficult to know if
the ship was moving at all some times. It is known that the Veil is carried in a
great circle around Pyandonea, but the wind is a slow and gentle one. Still, we
strove to ensure that we sailed perpendicular to the wind, keeping it always to
our left. The sea seemed to be a shade more green here as we approached
Pyandonea, but the change had been so slow and subtle over the course of the
venture it was difficult to know if it wasn’t imagined. It was here that we saw
our first sea-serpent, a dark shadow that moved beneath the waters, lingering,
and watching.

Eventually after days feeling lost beyond hope, the sun rose brightly over
Tiber’s Eye, and the wall was behind us, and ahead, the most all at once
beautiful and imposing sight I’d ever witnessed. The Coastline of Pyandonea is a
jagged maze of stone. It has no real shore to speak of, as much as it has sheer
cliff faces of ocean battered stone stretching dozens of feet above sea level,
and upon the plateaus, layers of further plateaus, with their own sheer walls
towering up. all of the Pyandonean islands are like this, great layer-cakes of
stone, and atop each layer of the plateaus, dense, wild jungle, as impenetrable
and dark as the night sky, but outwardly showing plants of every color, and
every shape. And among the trees and skyward stretching stone, white whips of
mist and cloud mingle with the jungle canopy. It rains upon the island almost as
often as it does not, even in winter.

The waters around the coast were crystalline in their clarity, one could look
down and see the shapes of great beasts swimming beneath the waters, or the
immense long leaves of kelp plants like thousands of towers stretching up from
the murk below. Having little choice in the matter, we anchored Tiber’s Eye some
hundred or so yards from the cliffs and I, along with a small support team, left
the ship aboard a dinghy, while the crew was left to survive off fishing and
what stockpile was left. Scaling the cliff walls of Pyandonea was a feat all its
own terrifying, and by the time we finally set our feet on the solid ground, my
left hand was near useless from pain. Our medic supplied me with an herbal tea
that left me sedate, but pain free, as the support team set up our camp. My
first notes on Pyandonea were written in that camp, in a tarp tent, under gentle
but unceasing rain and the harassment of stinging insects.
