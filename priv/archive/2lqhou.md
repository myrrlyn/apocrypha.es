Four. There are four. _\[I/We/Self\]_ understand it now. It is not too late to
stop it.

The Elder Scrolls _\[have/contain/operate\]_ a plan. All that has happened, or
will happen, is part of **the Scenario**. The clockwork heart of Nirn ticks out
the Scenario. The Actors, be us Man, Mer, or _\[Daedra/Demon/True\]_, play out
our _\[Roles/Lives/Violence\]_ per the Scenario. But we know this to be
_\[Incorrect/Wrong/True\]_. The Scenario has changed, many times, but
_\[I/we/self\]_ cannot fully _\[see/comprehend/know\]_ it, as our role changes
with it.

It is this final change that is terminal. Our role now is to die. This Scenario
is not our own, and we do not Know it. The Wheels of Lull are being overwritten
with the will of Sybandis, and Nirn’s heart ceases to tick.

But the four. The Signals. They are Aware, but unlike the Mechanisms, they are
_\[conscious/alive/thinking\]_. They act to fulfil their goals. They are not
Actors, and we are but insects to them. If there are the four that exist, there
must be the four that do not, for the constant zero must be maintained.

How blind we _\[children/inhabitants/slaves\]_ of the Aurbis are. How we should
have seen the awakening of Sybandis. We stand upon a dying world, not even
comprehending how to save it. We are not Aware.

_\[I/We/Self\]_ will attempt to _\[calm/slow/realize\]_. I commit too quickly to
the spore.

There is that which exists, in a _\[real/corporeal/temporal\]_ sense. There is
that which does not. That which is here, in the Aurbis with us, and that which
is not. The four, the Signals, are Present. _\[Walk-Brass/Numidium/The End\]_ is
here among us. The other four, the Mechanisms, are not. They do not exist. You
are _\[reading/seeing/violating\]_ scrolls that are not here among us.

Among the Present, there are the Direct, and the Indirect. They may be Active,
or Subversive.

Among the Absent, there is the Constant, and the Variable. It may be True, or
False.

These are Things. Things may be Direct or Indirect and Active or Subversive.
Things may be Constant or Variable and True or False.

**Things must not be Direct-True! It is _\[incorrect/wrong/terrible\]_! We must
not repeat this _\[mistake/tragedy/horror\]_! _\[Home/Origin/█████\]_ does not
Exist! It is not a Thing! _\[I/We/Self\]_ will not speak of non-Things! Anu must
not remember!**

_\[I/We/Self\]_ will attempt to _\[calm/slow/realize\]_. I commit too
emotionally to the spore.

Actors know. It is written into our being. But the four and four **Know**. They
are party to information beyond mere Actors. A Signal knows. A Mechanism knows.

These Things have names. It is not _\[forbidden/dangerous/terrifying\]_ to speak
these names. Speaking these names will not risk
_\[sublimation/erasure/apocalypse\]_.

The Present Direct Active is called **the Brute**. Pelinal. Ysgramor.
_\[Walk-Brass/Numidium/The End\]_. Aurbis knows well its touch. It uses
_\[violence/death/erasure\]_ to enact change in the Scenario. It Knows violence,
and uses it indiscriminately. Pelinal’s might. Ysgramor’s companions. The
_\[Musical/Tonal/Mathematical\]_ _\[Erasure/Negation/Sublimation\]_ weapon
wielded by _\[Walk-Brass/Numidium/The End\]_. It will use its Knowledge of
violence to kill and destroy obstacles to the world’s new fate and force the
Scenario to change.

The Present Direct Subversive is called **the Betrayer**. _\[KINMUNE/Erasure/The
Adversary\]_. Ayrenn. Lorkhan. It Knows the mind. It works through influence,
changing Actors and their roles to change the Scenario. _\[KINMUNE/Erasure/The
Adversary\]_ _\[is/will/was\]_ making fools of us all, and Nirn
_\[is/will/was\]_ dying. I should speak no more. The Betrayer will use its
Knowledge of the mind to make Actors slaves to their new fate and force the
Scenario to change.

The Present Indirect Active is called **he Preacher**. Heimskr.
██████████████████. Kagrenac. The Preacher has Knowledge of truth. Pure truth
spoken to an Actor will never be understood, but the strongest Actors may choose
to act on it, and take their new assigned role. The Preacher changes the
Scenario from within, by denying it Actors until it changes. It will speak truth
with its Knowledge until the Scenario is forced to follow its Actors.

The Present Indirect Subversive is called **the Liar**. M’aiq. M’aiq. M’aiq.
There is only one of the Liar, but it is several. Its singularity is a lie. Its
multitude is a lie. The Liar exists only to reign in other Signals, and the
Actors controlled by Mechanisms. It Knows many things. It will impress upon
those it targets their restraint by the Scenario. It will try to take from them
their ability to change it. The Liar has _\[killed/erased/damned\]_ us.

I hear the grinding of the Wheels of Lull. _\[Walk-Brass/Numidium/The End\]_
stands near me. It is the only light as I commit to the spore. The sun
_\[is/was/will be\]_ no more. It destroys the agents of _\[KINMUNE/Erasure/The
Adversary\]_ who try to stop me from _\[telling/warning/educating\]_ those of
Superkalpic turns that follow. _\[KINMUNE/Erasure/The Adversary\]_ tries to stop
me. I am not afriad. **Let the bitch try.**

_\[I/We/Self\]_ will attempt to _\[calm/slow/realize\]_. I commit too spitefully
to the spore.

The Absent Constant True is **the Prophecy**. The Elder Scrolls contain the
Prophecy, as written in the ticking of the hearts of Nirn and Sybandis. You may
hold an Elder Scroll, but it is not Here. It is the Prophecy that has
_\[damned/erased/tortured\]_ us, for in stealing the creatia from Nirn, Sybandis
has imposed its heart upon the Prophecy, and in turn upon the Scenario. Time is
no more, as Akatosh chokes upon his own flesh. There is no place for Time in
this Scenario, and the Prophecy determines the Scenario as much as possible,
lest it be determined instead.

The Absent Constant False is **the Backdoor**. The principles behind the
Constant Zero Delineation Algorythm. The Dreamsleeve’s physics, which we exploit
to defy the kalpic cycle and mundane time and distance. The recognition of the
_\[Tower/Royalty/CHIM\]_ and power over reality it entails. The Scenario does
not leave us without _\[tools/salvation/freedom\]_. No matter how the Prophecy
tries, it cannot completely overcome the Backdoor. There is no place for Time in
this scenario, but the local C0DA I have erected provides a sense of linearity.
When Sybandis collapses, these notes will be _\[preserved/safe/existant\]_ in
the non-existence of the Dreamsleeve. We are clever Actors, we
_\[children/inhabitants/slaves\]_ of the Aurbis.

The Absent Variable True is **the System**. The mechanisms of linear and
non-linear time. The _\[world/existence/being\]_ upon which the Kalpic and
Superkalpic cycles rotate. The Memory possessed by we Actors, by the Signals,
and by the Mechanisms. This is the process by which the Scenario plays out. All
that is _\[exists/lives/dies\]_ by the functioning of the System. Sybandis did
not possess the System. This is our only _\[momentary/small/weak\]_ salvation,
as its heart must learn the System to usurp it. _\[KINMUNE/Erasure/The
Adversary\]_ teaches it. The Wheels of Lull grind ever louder.

The Absent Variable False is **the Virus**. It should not be. It must not be.
But I see now that it is. I have long suspected the Hist of being Signals. They
are not. They do not exist within the System. They wield only avatars, their
trees are but fingers of a singular whole that exists outside of The Aurbis.
When Sybandis collapses the whole of the Aurbis in its flailings, the Hist will
merely grow again. They are foreign. I suspect now that they are not the only
one. That entities outside of the Aurbis possess similar avatars. That several
of our greatest heroes have been alien, processes injected into the System to
subvert the Prophecy and Scenario. It is the only way the Virus can function,
through such injections into the System. It may, in fact, be the origin of some
Signals. A troubling thought.

I am unsure how that makes me feel, to know that I may be the puppet of an
uncaring god, perhaps from _\[Home/Origin/█████\]_ as Anu…

_\[I/We/Self\]_ will attempt to _\[calm/slow/realize\]_. I commit too fearfully
to the spore.

_\[Home/Origin/█████\]_ does not exist. But the Wheels of Lull slow. The world
will not stop shaking, and _\[Walk-Brass/Numidium/The End\]_ has fallen. Soon, I
will not exist. I will never have existed. Perhaps _\[I/we/self\]_ will see this
place from which our existence hails…

I _\[commit/give/sacrifice\]_ this spore to the Dreamsleeve. May it save another
Aurbis from our fate.
