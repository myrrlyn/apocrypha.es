Werebears are found along the north of Tamriel. Namely, Morrowind, Skyrim and
High Rock. They used to be found primarily in Skyrim. They have migrated
primarily to Solstheim and High Rock, but small populations can be find in
Skyrim and even as far south as northern Cyrodiil These lycanthropes are not
influenced by the moons and hunt primarily during the day. They’re generally
solitary creatures and this is reflected in their hunting strategy, as it is not
based on teamwork; often you will only find werebears in groups when they need
safety in numbers. This is especially important for lycanthropes when
lycanthropy is hunted like it is in Tamriel. Canis root can deter werebears and
it is recommended to use it if you believe there is one nearby. However, it is
still important to be very careful, as canis root will not prevent a
particularly determined werebear from attacking. They are also far from
stealthy, but make up for this with their strength and size.

**TL;DR: Werebears are like bears**

## Beast Form

These beasts are very dangerous. Their teeth and claw attacks are more than
enough to rip through steel armour. Their massive paws alone could act like a
mace. As I said before, they rarely fight in groups and tend to be solitary
hunters. They can move comfortably on many different kinds of terrain, including
in water or in large, sturdy trees. A werebear in water is uncommon, however, as
their habitat tends to have very cold waters. They are far from the fastest of
werebeasts, but if one starts chasing after you, you’ll have better luck praying
to a mudcrab for help than running away to safety

**TL;DR: Werebears are big and scary**

## Normal Form

You can tell someone is a werebear by their unusually hairy body. Although hair
can potentially be found on their entire body, it is particularly abundant on
the places that one would normally develop hair during puberty. Their bones are
much stronger than usual and can withstand much heavier blows than any normal
person could. Their teeth and nails tend to be much stronger as well, and can be
a serious threat. They don’t tend to be particularly aggressive but can be
extremely defensive. When approaching a werebear in their normal form, do not
underestimate them. Even though they are far from as strong as they would be
when transformed, they are still likely much stronger than you. For example, a
bosmer werebear would be about equal to an orc in a fist fight.

**TL;DR Even in their normal form, they’re big and scary**
