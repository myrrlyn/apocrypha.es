```verse
Farewell sweet leaves,
farewell sweet trees,
leaves glistening in the winds.
Farewell Falinesti
the city that walks
the city that roams free.
Farewell blue streams of Valenwood
running wild through the Green.
Farewell sweet Jagga,
Imga and Orc,
here under the trees.
My story has been spun,
it has come to a close
for Y’ffre has told that it must be,
here under the Green.
