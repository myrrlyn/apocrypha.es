After our extensive research into Ragnvald and Otar the Mad I have become
increasingly interested in finding the final resting places of the remaining
Dragon Priests in Skyrim. My primary goal is to find all of highest ranking
Priests who were granted masks from their dragon overlords. The ones that I have
been able to identify have lead me to believe that this inner circle forsook
their original names and took new names given by the dragons or took the name of
the mask. Now after a couple of months of research I have found the location of
another Priest but his resting place leaves me with as many questions as Otar
did.

I identified the priest known as Krosis, and his resting place. I have been able
to slowly translate the dragon language thanks largely to [book][0] written by
Hela Thrice-Versed. I will offer you the translations that I have been able to
uncover in the coming reports. Surprisingly every tome and oral tradition I
looked into pointed to the mountain top of Shearpoint. Located east of Whiterun
on the southern fringe of the Pale, Shearpoint is a solitary peak on the end of
a short chain of mountains stretching towards Windhelm. Upon arriving at the
sight my colleagues and I were surprised to find no ruin or temple, only a
solitary black wall, undoubtedly one of the “word walls” so many adventurers and
scholars had spoken of. I have done my best to translate it from dragonic to
Tamrielic.

Modir the Far raised (this) stone(in his) brother’s memory, Oskarthe Fool, whose
voice was weak and not (the) mighty shout of his clan.

It seems as if the ancient Nords erected these walls as monuments to fallen
family, comrades or friends. I also reason that given the Dragon Cults place as
the ruling body of Skyrim during the Merethic Era, they certainly would have had
to have the dragons or their priests permission and blessing to raise such a
monument. What was interesting was that I felt the same sensations that others
have described when observing the walls. I felt that certain words contained a
sort of, power. They seemed to call out, as if almost waiting to be read by one
who could understand and make use of whatever power is contained. It seemed that
this knowledge would not be obtained for free though.

At the foot of this wall, lay a single black coffin. The lid looked as though it
had been thrown open by a mighty force, inside lay the remains of a set of
armor, ash, and what appeared to be the mask of a Dragon Priest. It was greenish
in appearance and the face engraved seemed to posses a neutral, almost haughty
features. I was sure I had located the priest, Krosis. As far as I can
translate, Krosis seems to mean “Sorrow” in Tamrielic. This would be
characteristic of the tales and legends I have learned of these priests. That
they were men of powerful will and terrible powers. Yet the burial place of
Krosis troubled me. He was not interred in an elaborate tomb or temple, I have
seen lesser men buried here in Skyrim with more pomp and circumstance. So the
obvious question is why was he to be found out in the open, on top of this
unassuming mountain? We were not so lucky as to find an epic poems as we did
with Otar, so my fellow scholars and I have debated several theories.

The simplest explanation is that Krosis chose this spot himself. Being a dragon
priest it assured that his word was law and only his authority only surpassed by
that of the dragons themselves. Many seemed to be obsessed with prolonging their
lives through unnatural means and would want to maintain their bodies in order
to possibly rise again. Perhaps he was simply being pragmatic in choosing a
remote unadorned location in order to protect his body so he could rise again in
service of the dragons. (Note: It seems that he attempted to after the return of
the dragons, but mercifully some force or hero put a stop to it.) Perhaps this
stop atop Shearpoint held special significance to him and that is why he chose
the spot for himself. Given the Nords affinity for calling themselves, “children
of the sky” it was perhaps symbolic to him to be buried in the open air, not far
from the Throat of the World where the Nords believe life was first breathed
into them.

Another theory we have debated is that he was ordered (or punished) by the
dragons to be buried in this area. One thought is that Krosis may have sworn an
oath to protect a certain area his subjects lived, or that he was bound to this
area by some promise or oath. Alternatively, being one of the highest ranking
dragon priests, it would only be acceptable that he should be buried in a
mausoleum of fitting grandeur. Being denied such a right would be no doubt be
extremely shameful to an undoubtedly proud and perhaps arrogant ruler. Forcing
him to be buried like a commoner on a lonely mountain would be a suitable
punishment for whatever crime or act he may have committed. Given how the Dragon
War ended we can only speculate but perhaps Krosis was unable to control his
subjects or lost a particularly important battle. My peers have also said that
he may have been slew in battle and was given such a burial to “inspire” the
other priests not to repeat the same mistake.

Given the lack of evidence it is hard to determine exactly why such a powerful
priest was buried in such a location but as always, we hope that time and
further investigation will give us a clearer picture of Krosis, his life, and
the unique place of his burial.
