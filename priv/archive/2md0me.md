The substances of Moon Sugar and Skooma have greatly affected social, economic,
cultural, and religious aspects of nearly all races in Tamriel, with almost all
of the users being Khajiit. But before we discuss the effects that Moons Sugar
and Skooma have on Tamriel, we must first have a strong understanding of what
these substances are.

Moon Sugar: an illegal and addictive drug found in sugar canes native to the
Tenmar Forest of southern Elsweyr. Raw substance.

Skooma: a refined version of Moon Sugar. Has the same effects on the consumer as
Moon Sugar, but to a larger extent. Can be smoked, drunk, or eaten.

## Uses

The drugs of Moon Sugar and Skooma are used because they can benefit the user in
various ways. The most common way Moon Sugar and Skooma benefit the user is by
acting as a recreational drug. The effects of the drug are as follows: an acute
energetic bodily sensation that gives skooma users an increase in physical
strength and speed while impairing one’s ability to rationalize or respond
quickly to stimulus. Prolonged use of skooma has been known to cause dangerous
psychological and physical addiction and in some cases, death. Other uses for
Moon Sugar and Skooma include, but are not limited to: seasoning for meats and
complimenting spices, an active ingredient in alchemy, and in Khajiit religious
ceremonies.

## Religion

Moon Sugar and Skooma are held in high positions in the Khajiit religion, seen
as gifts from the gods, often serving an important role in religious ceremonies
involving the moon gods Jone and Jode. The substances are held to such a high
religious standard that the Khajiit believe that if they consume Moon Sugar or
Skooma, they are partially consuming the wisdom and power of the moon gods Jone
and Jode, a religious experience which gives them large amounts of ecstasy and
euphoria. Some beliefs hold that the sugar is crystallized moonlight caught in
the water of the Topal Sea and brought to the sugarcane groves of the Tenmar by
the force of the twin tides. Overall, the substances of Moon Sugar and Skooma
are glorified and romanticized in the Khajiit religion and culture, to the point
that partaking in the consumption of the drugs is not only accepted, but
encouraged. It is not uncommon to see many Khajiit in euphoric episodes at many
major cities in Elsweyr.

## Trade and Production

It is not uncommon to stumble upon a large Moon Sugar plantation in the lands of
Elsweyr, and occasionally Morrowind. The publicity of the drug production can be
attributed to the cultural and religious acceptance of it, but also the lack of
state intervention to stop the large epidemic. In the 5th era, there has not
been a single distribution and/or production market. In fact, the only known
time that almost all Moon Sugar production was under a single distributer and/or
producer was Around the year 3E 433 when a known skooma smuggling ring operated
out of Cheydinhal, and an entire residence was converted into a skooma den in
the Cyrodiilic town of Bravil. This was also the first time a large smuggling
ring had established firm ties to foreign territories. Moon Sugar and Skooma are
most commonly smuggled to Argonia on ships, and to Valenwood on horseback. The
trade is large in Morrowind to to the Dunmer’s common interest in the drugs. The
trade is fairly weak in Cyrodiil and other Imperial territories due to the
Empire’s enforcement on the ban of the narcotics.

## International Opinions

Options on the Moon Sugar and Skooma depend on the race of a person, his/her
upbringing, and his/her place of origin. In the lands of Morrowind, the drug is
heavily looked down upon, and is seen as a symbol of the poor and lazy;
merchants will not do any business with a person if he/she is carrying any of
the substances. In Cyrodiil and other Imperial territories, the drug and its
users are not as looked down upon, as the number of users is far lower in the
empire. In Argonia, the drugs are looked towards with neutrality, and most
people are busy doing other things to ponder the importance of the substances.
Most other places in the empire, the drugs are too scarce for citizens to care
any about them.
