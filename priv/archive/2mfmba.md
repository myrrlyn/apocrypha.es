Many of you have spent your lives worshipping your various time Gods.

Alkosh, the Dragon King of Cats, who repelled an assault by the Whitestrake
against the chosen of Azurah.

Alduin, the World Eater, who is the end to all, until the mighty Nords stood
against him!

Akatosh, the Dragon God of time of the Cyrodiilic Empire, who banished Mehrunes
Dagon, ending the Oblivion Crisis and gifted Alessia with the Dragonblood,
protecting Tamriel for centuries!

Auri-El, who the Aldmer believe sundered the trickster Lorkhan for their mortal
imprisonment, who bound the Dragon, and flung his heart far.

All of these gods are real, yes! But you have all been wrong all this time, for
in the Era of Landfall I have witnessed the True Time God as he was Reborn! The
Aka-Tusk, of whom all these Gods are but pieces. Worship him!

I saw his Apotheosis, he is all your gods reborn, with the paws of a Khajiit,
the Wings of Auri-El, the shared Tail of Alduin and Akatosh! He rose from
Adamatia to restore the world from the Numidium’s wrath an has earned your
veneration! So come, worship him with us!
