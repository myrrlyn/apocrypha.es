  I’m planning on making the rest of the parts longer, this is just sort of a

Middle of the second era, thrassian plague has caused the Sload to be hated by
everyone and they are now isolated on Thras:

The story I am about to tell you is one of magic, wonder, and a sload named
S’Grackk. Let me tell you something, S’Grackk was a wizard who managed to get in
some trouble and is now on his way to being sacrificed at the pillar in the
center of Thras, two completely unrelated topics.

“All I did was destroy a couple of coral structures!”

The elder doing the sacrifice looks at him with exhaustion, and motions to the
guards, who start moving towards him with spears.

“You are not here because of your destruction, you have been selected to be
sacrificed to Mannimarco. You know how it works, either he takes you, or he
leaves you to plunge through the sky onto the cold hard ground below.” The elder
says cynically.

“Is there any way I can get out of this?”

“Well I can tell you really are panicked otherwise you would have already
thought of the answer.”

“I have.”

Those are the last words that anyone on Thras would hear from him, it was also
the exact moment that S’Grackk excepted his fate as a sacrifice to Mannimarco.
The guards pushed him off the pillar and he started falling, praying to the
great necromancer to give him a swift death, unlike some he had seen before. He
felt the sharp air stinging his face as he fell, and then a soft breeze.

“I love it when they try to have emotions!” A ghostly, soft voice says.

“Why am I not dead?” S’Grackk whimpers.

“Oh you will be, don’t worry, but first I need you, I command you to do
something. Also open your damn eyes!” The voice commands.

S’Grackk opens his eyes to see a tall pale elf with a black staff, they are both
sitting in the middle of an open field.

“Where are we? Who are you? Are you sure that I’m not dead?” S’Grackk asks,
panicked.

“We are in Artaeum, third largest island in the summerset isles, I am
Mannimarco, and DO YOU QUESTION ME?”

“N… No sir, I wasn’t aware that…” He is cut off.

“Shut up S’Grackk.” Mannimarco says with a smile

“You are stuttering.”
