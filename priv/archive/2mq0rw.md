  Just a short old story about a farmer and her attempts to become successful.
---

Long ago there was a farmer name Maesa. Maesa lived in a small house in the
Colovian Highlands. She lived alone and farm work did not come easy in her
lands. Fed up with her lack of success, Maesa ventured out across the hills and
mountains of the highlands north of her. After two straight days of walking
Maesa came upon the most idyllic valley she had ever laid eyes upon. A small
river ran down from a hill to the north and cut a circuitous path through the
valley. Every inch of the valley was filled with life. Grasses twice as tall as
a person ran along the river, Clouded Funnel Cap was seen on the tops of the
high hills, there was Fennel Seed, Mandrake, a hundred trees at least, and many
more varieties of plants beyond count.

“I have never seen such beauty in all my life,” thought Maesa. “This shall be
where I build my new farm. The corn I plant here will be the greatest in all of
Cyrodiil.”

So Maesa constructed her new farm house, and planted her corn on a small stretch
of undisturbed land within this magical valley. Sure enough, within a short time
her crop sprouted and was soon full grown. And it was without a doubt the finest
corn in all of Cyrodiil. Demand for her corn in Chorrol grew, especially as no
one knew where her secret farm was.

Soon Maesa thought, “I’m going to need to plant more crops on more of this land.
But there are all these other plants in the way. The only option seems to be to
remove them.”

The first to go was the Fennel Seed and the Mandrakes. Maesa was sad to see them
go, and she considered not doing it for many days. But in the end, she tore them
out with a heavy heart. She planted more corn there and, sure enough, in a very
short time there was more of her famous corn fully grown. Her corn began to
outnumber all the other plants. _And the Keeper-of-Order was displeased_. She
had so much she was soon able to start export them to other cities of Colovia.
Demand for her corn grew higher.

Soon Maesa thought, “I’m going to need to plant more crops on more of this land.
But there are all these other plants in the way. Well the only option is to
remove them.”

The next to go was the tall grasses by the river. Maesa felt bad tearing out
these plants out, and considered doing it for the better part of a day. But in
the end, she tore them out, although she felt a little bad about it. More corn
was planted, and again it grew fast and produced her famous crops. Corn now
began to push out other native plants as well. _And the Keeper-of-Order was
displeased_. She now had so much corn she started selling to the Niben Valley as
well. There were even people eating her food in the Imperial City! Maesa knew
she had to keep growing her farm and produce more.

Next she tried to remove the great trees of the valley, and she went about it
without a second thought in her head. This, however, proved to be more work than
she thought. The trees were thick and strong, and no matter how many times she
hit them with an axe she could not cut them down.

One night, after a particularly long day of attempting to remove the trees, an
exhausted Maesa prayed to the gods for help…. and the gods heard her. With a
small “puff” of air, two beings appeared to Maesa in her farm house. The first
took the form of a four-legged dragon, although he was now only the size of a
grown man. The second took the form of an old lady, dressed all in darkness.
Maesa was startled at first but quickly composed herself, after all, it’s bad
manners to act shocked in front of the gods.

“We have heard your words, mortal, and have come,” said the dragon.

“This must be father Akatosh! Which must make her mother Kynareth!” thought
Maesa with a feeling of excitement. It’s not often a farm girl has gods in her
home.

“I…. I…. I thank you for coming,” stuttered Maesa. She spoke only to the dragon.
Something about Kynareth made her feel uneasy; in fact, she was almost repulsed
by her. Of course, Maesa didn’t show this, as that would be bad manners.

“You seek our help in removing the trees of this valley, the way you removed the
other plants in order for you to grow more crops. And you shall have our help,”
spoke the dragon. “You must take this mushroom.” And with that, a mushroom
appeared in the dragon’s out stretched claw. “Plant it in your fields and in the
morning all the bad plants will start to die. You see, this is a magic
mushroom.”

Maesa was filled with joy. She quickly took the mushroom and ran out of her farm
house to plant the mushroom. When she finished she returned inside only to find
her house empty. That night she dreamt dreams of riches and fame, and of the
amount of crops she would grow. _And the Dreamweaver looked on with jealous
eyes_.

Back in Oblivion, Peryite and Namira reveled in the success of their plan. For
see this was no ordinary magic mushroom, but a creation of Peryite. So the two
Daedric Princes reveled on, and _He-Who-Revels-In-Revelry_ was pleased.

Come the next morning, Maesa woke up more excited than she had ever been. She
raced outside to see the magic of the mushroom at work. What she saw instead
terrified her. Billowing forth from the mushroom was a dark poisonous gas. The
gas seemed to be alive as it raced to and fro from all of Maesa’s crops. Every
corn stalk it passed withered and died in seconds. Within minutes all of her
hard work was gone. When the last corn stalk died, the gas raced back to the
mushroom and then the mushroom died as well. Maesa cried. She cried harder than
she had ever in her life. She cried all day and well into the night. That night
she dreamt horrible dreams of death and despair. And the Dreamweaver was
pleased.

However, as she slept something else happened. Namira, _Lady of Decay_, reached
forth her hands from the darkness. She grabbed and ate up all the dead crops and
plants of the valley, and after they passed through her they were changed. No
longer dead plants but new things: seed and soil, vitamin and nutrient. She gave
these gifts to her _Sister-of-the-Sky_, whom she both loves and hates, and the
_Sky-Mother_ put forth her power. These plants grew with such strength as has
never been seen elsewhere.

In the morning, Maesa woke with a depressed heart. She made for the door, having
decided to have one more look on her ruin before packing up and leaving. What
she saw instead marveled her. Where there was death and darkness last night,
there was now life and light. All the original plants of the valley had come
back. There were grasses as twice as tall as a person along the river, Clouded
Funnel Cap was seen on the tops of the high hills, there was Fennel Seed,
Mandrake, a hundred trees at least, and many more varieties of plants beyond
count.

Balance had been restored. _And the Taskmaster was happy_.
