Transcribed on the 4th of Evening Star, 4E 20X, the continued questioning of
Elenwen Jororin, First Emissary of the Thalmor Embassy in Skyrim.

Interrogator—Discuss the peace treaty brokered between the Imperial Legion and
the Stormcloaks. Who was behind it; why did it succeed?

**Elenwen—After the rumors of the encounter on the Throat of the World with the
dragon Alduin, the Dragonborn quickly set about meeting with General Tullius and
Ulfric. Tullius informed me of the meeting at High Hrothgar and as per the
conditions of the Concordant, my presence was to ensure no terms of the “treaty”
violated our… understanding with the Empire.**

I—And you had no concern that this treaty would bring an end the fighting?
Thalmor sovereignty was being subverted while the Dragonborn dictated such a
peace in your very presence.

**E—The Dragon threat was the encouragement both sides needed to meet at the
table.**

I—And you thought nothing about what the last Dragon of the North did the
previous Aldmeri Dominion? You dispatched no fewer than three execution squads
after the Dragonborn; And while those teams may have mistakes that cost them
their lives, as their commanding officer, you are still responsible for their
failure.

**E—In hindsight, I should have sent more, but I was concerned about the
reaction the Nords would have if they knew were openly trying to kill the
Dragonborn. Their regard for the Dragonborn is without question.**

I – Unfortunately, what was once a minor inconvenience at best for you had now
become a problem for us. The question is no longer when we will Dragonborn. The
question is “if”. Alinor has read the reports from your former Third Emissary
regarding the Dragonborn's travels to Solstheim. From what we can gather, they
now hold powers they should have never been allowed to acquire in the first
place. And thanks to you, they now stands as the greatest unknown in our ongoing
agenda.

**E – I…**

I – Anything else you have to say on that subject will only further our belief
in your incompetence. What of your efforts against the Penitus Oculatus? They
have been operating in Hammerfell for years and yet, despite having a formal
presence in Skyrim, we have received little word on their activities in the
province.

**E—Their headquarters in Dragon Bridge has been under surveillance since before
our formal arrival in the province. Their uniformed agents are readily identify,
but it is clear, they’ve learned from the mistakes of their predecessors – the
Blades. I believe they were responsible for Ulfric's capture at Darkwater
Crossing, and that they learned of Ulfric's plan to acquire the Jagged Crown. We
were still waiting to here the results of that endeavor.**

I – You and I both know they started a proxy war long before now. How else do
you explain Ulfric's capture? Where was your vigilance, your foresight when our
agenda in Skyrim nearly came to an end on a chopping block? Alinor and the
Vindicator-General are correct in their belief that things have gotten our of
hand here. However, it seems you still have some use to the Dominion after all.
