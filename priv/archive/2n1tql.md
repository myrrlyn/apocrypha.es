In the land of Resdayn, that is, Morrowind, there lived a Dwemer named Judeth.
She was known throughout the land as the finest locksmith that ever lived. It
was said that she invented the lock, but she would deny this. “I did not invent
the lock,” she would say. “But I did perfect it. And this is a greater feat.”

One day, Judeth issued a challenge throughout all the land. And she said, “Are
not my locks the greatest, most beautiful and most secure in all the land? If
any mer or man can open my greatest lock without its key, I will give him the
contents of the chest it seals shut, the object that is most precious to man and
mer, that which kings and queens would surrender their lands and riches for.”

Then men and mer answered the challenge. Shining Chimer tried to solve the
riddle of Judeth’s lock, but always were baffled by it’s cunning pins. Wise
Dwemer lifted and tested the springs to coax their secrets from them, but the
tumblers remained secure and the chest remained shut. And many Dwemer wise in
their own eyes returned unto their stone rooms and pondered the meaning of their
failures.

Thirteen days times thirteen passed and no man or mer could thrust open the lid
of the chest and wrest the treasure from its opening. And Judeth declared, “Is
no one in all of Nirn capable of opening this lock and claiming the treasure
therein?”

And after three days a strange woman came unto Judeth. She had the appearance of
a cat, and yet she walked on two legs, like mer and man did. And she spoke with
strange words and strange ways. And she bowed low to the ground and said, “My
name is Ki’ta-daro of the lands of the Khajiit, far to the south. This one has
heard your challenge and wishes to put your locks to the test and to see the
treasure of your promise, for Ki’ta-daro is a master of unlocking and there is
no lock which she has not been able to open.”

But Judeth was not impressed and presented her with a basic lock, a kind which a
child would guard his toys with, and asked her to open it. Then Ki’ta-daro took
pick and tool and within seconds, opened the lock.

And Judeth smiled and presented her with a fine lock, a kind which merchants
would guard their storerooms with, and asked her to open it. Then Ki’ta-daro
took pick and tool and within minutes, opened the lock.

And Judeth was delighted, and presented her with an ornate lock, a kind which
rich mer would guard their treasures with, and asked her to open it. Then
Ki’ta-daro took pick and tool and within an hour, opened the lock.

And Judeth was pleased, for she knew that the Khajiit was cunning. And she said,
“Truly you are a master of unlocking, for you have opened locks that no mer
before has opened. But you have not yet opened my greatest lock, and beheld the
treasure that is most precious to mer and men.”

Then Judeth presented to Ki’ta-daro her greatest lock, and the Khajiit had seen
nothing like it. It held the likeness of the world, cast from Dwemer metal, gilt
with gold and edged around with silver. On the inside were inscribed the
mysteries of Nirn, and on the outside were inscribed the mysteries of Aetherius,
and it was beautiful to behold. And Ki’ta-daro was astonished and said, “This
one is pleased to behold your creation and it will bring her even greater
pleasure to open it without its key.”

Then Ki’ta-daro took pick and took and was dismayed, for the lock defied her
seeking pick and withstood her strong tool. And a pin she thought secure would
move when she touched another. And when she turned the lock, the chest would not
open, but the pins again sprung loose. And Ji’ta-daro labored a full day and a
full night with pick and tool and the lock yet remained shut. Then Ki’ta-daro
was sorrowful and said, “This one is most sorrowful of heart, for though she is
a master of unlocking, she cannot open this lock. But grant Ki’ta-daro this: let
her see you open the lock with its key and view the treasure that she cannot
have.” And Judeth said, “It will be done.”

Then Judeth took her key and fit it in the lock. She turned it once to the
right, again to the right, once to the left and again to the right. Then the
pins were aligned and the lock was loosed from its place. And the chest was
opened, but no treasure lie within, no piles of gold, no scrolls of knowledge,
no weapons of war. And Ki’ta-daro was bewildered and said, “Where is this
treasure of yours? Has this one toiled for a full day and a full night,
straining away at nothing but air?”

And Judeth smiled and said, “What is more precious than air? For no mer can
breathe gold. And no man can take silver into his lungs. And if he is cast into
the vastness of the ocean, would he not surrender his lands and his riches to
have air once more?”

Then Ki’ta-daro was wroth, for in her foolishness she had humbled herself before
air and opened locks for a breath of wind. And in fury she departed from Resdayn
and the Dwemer, to never return. And Judeth laughed and was delighted in her
heart, for she knew that her locks were the greatest, most beautiful and most
secure in the land.
