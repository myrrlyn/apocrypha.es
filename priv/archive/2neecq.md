After nearly a year of exploration my expedition finally had achieved our goal,
we had all eight masks of the highest ranking dragon priests of the Dragon Cult
of Skyrim. Yet there were still unanswered questions in Bromjunaar, the wooden
mask and the small room it was found in. Several of our best mages were left at
the location to discern the nature of the mask while we continued to explore the
last ruin. Then not long ago I received a message from them with ecstatic
contents, they had finally discovered why the mask was associated with time. One
of them had finally dared to put on the mask and found themselves transported
not to a different location, but to a different time. The sanctuary that had
been dilapidated in the present was now pristine in the distant past, the shrine
was also complete and its purpose was now obvious. The various masks of the
dragon priests could be placed upon this shrine to some unknown end. They could
not access any other part of the ruin, save for that small room, but when they
took off the mask they found themselves returned to the present time, and to a
frightened compatriot.

The rest of the expedition and I set off in haste to return to Bromjunaar with
our collection of masks. When we finally arrive I was elected to be the one to
don the wooden mask and find out what would transpire when all the masks were
placed upon the shrine. I slowly took the wooden mask, it was identical to all
the others, and brought it up to my face. I closed my eyes. Suddenly I was aware
of a change, a sensation I had never felt before, it was as if time had been
altered. When I opened my eyes again I found the entire place transformed. As
the mage had said the room was no longer ruined or open to the elements. I
turned around where my fellow scholars had stood and perhaps foolishly swatted
at the air to see if they were still there yet unseen. My hands found nothing, I
was in a truly different time. Now my attention turned to the shrine. Out of the
rucksack I took the masks and it was clear I couldn’t just put them up in any
order, small markings in the dragon language translated to their names. On the
left side I placed Volsung, Vokun, Otar, and Morokei. On the right side, Krosis,
Hevnoraak, Nahkriin, and Rahgot. As soon as all the masks were in their place
the center carving of a dragons head opened up. What I beheld astounded me. A
new mask. This one was unlike all the others. I took it out of its resting place
along with all the other masks and removed the wooden mask.

I now sit in a safe location, I fear to put that information to paper. Yet I
have now had time to study this final, ninth mask. It is wrought entirely of
gold and the head covering that was contained with it is also made of rich
fabric, its threads the color of black and gold. The mask itself has a different
appearance that the other eight. The eyes appear to be similar, but instead of
the appearance of a mouth two large tusks or horns protrude from the cheek
areas. It gives it a very primal appearance. When I asked the mages of the
enchantment they took sometime to discern it. All they could tell me was that it
had multiple enchantments. One appeared to sense when the wearer was near death
and would actually heal the one who was wearing it, in addition to healing it
could also cast a cloak of fire to envelop and protect the bearer. They seemed
less sure of this finally ability but the mask might even be able to summon a
spectre of an unknown variety. Perhaps in the future we will put those
enchantments to the test. The name of the mask, as indicated in the sanctuary,
is “Konahrik.” I have translated this to mean “Warlord” Now what significance or
purpose this mask held, we have hotly debated amongst ourselves.

One theory put forward by my colleagues was that Konahrik was the head of the
the dragon priests. They believe that he was the most powerful of them all and
thus, he ruled over them all, perhaps holding the highest position a man could
hold in the Dragon Cult. When pressed on why the mask was locked away instead of
being found with the respective priest they offered a few explanations. One idea
was that Konahrik would have certainly lead loyal forces of men against the
rebellion and might have fallen in battle, rather than let the mask fall into
the wrong hands the remaining priests chose instead to lock it away. One
scholars in that camp opted for the idea of a conspiracy. He said that the other
priests might have become jealous of the power and prestige that Konahrik held
and therefore, plotted against him. Perhaps he was murdered by his fellow
priests and his mask locked away so that none may have held such power. I take
issue with this theory because the dragons certainly would have taken notice of
the murder of a man they had appointed to the position

As for myself, I am of the opinion that Konahrik was not an individual dragon
priest, but a position in the Dragon Cult. An extraordinary position at that,
opposed to ordinary positions. The way the mask was sealed away seems to
indicate that the eight priests would need to be in agreement to lock or unlock
the mask. I put forward that here we have the basis of the modern day Moot of
the Nords. In times of extraordinary need such as rebellion or war, the priests
would see fit to elect one of their number, or some other ruler or warrior, to
the position of Warlord. Then they would either be granted extra power and
abilities or unlimited power and authority, for a set amount of time. Then
whoever was elected to this position would carry out their duty until the crisis
or need had ended. They would then give up this power and return to their
station lest they try to keep this power and face the wrath of their fellow
priests and perhaps the dragon’s themselves. From this process of consensus and
election either by unanimous vote or a majority, we get the framework for
Skyrim’s modern day political system of the Jarls electing one of their own
number to the position of High King. When asked the same question of why this
was found in the sanctuary and not on a dragon priest, I said that during the
Dragon War someone must have been elected to the position of Konahrik. However
perhaps after the tide had turned against the Cult and seeing the writing on the
wall, they resolved to hide the mask away, so that it could not fall into the
hands of rebellion. In my humble opinion, the arrangement of the sanctuary and
the busts for the masks seems to indicate that there had to be consensus among
all of the priests to acquire or lock away Konahrik.

For the time being both theories remain valid due to the lack of sufficient
evidence. However my fellow scholars and I now face a problem we did not
foresee. This note was found the body of a Thalmor agent outside of the ruin of
Forelhost.

_You will proceed to the ruins of Forelhost to retrieve the Mask from the Dragon
Cult there. If you are discovered, impersonate an officer. It is unlikely that
anyone from Skyrim will be clever enough to see through the disguise. Once you
have obtained the Mask, bring it to Labyrinthian._

It is clear that the Thalmor are also seeking the masks and Konahrik. Now here I
sit in possession of them all. I fear for the safety of my fellow academics, and
myself and must decide on where to go so that we will be safe. Someone mentioned
that the Thalmor do not have a strong presence on Solstheim…
