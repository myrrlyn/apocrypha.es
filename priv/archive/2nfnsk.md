  Hello, fellow scholars of r/teslore.

  I’ve been lurking for some time now, and decided I could participate myself.
  I'm not very confident about my knowledge of the lore, but I'll try my best.
  Also, my first language is French, so do not hesitate to correct me if I –
  no, *when* I'll make mistakes.

  I haven’t yet translated some of my more serious texts. My idea for today was
  to present some terrible puns, collected in various times and places of
  Tamriel by Hermaeus Mora, who likes a good(?) laugh. I know most of them are
  quite approximate, and that it isn’t a deeper exploration of the lore. But
  hey, some lore books *are* joke collections.

1. An old Nord priest and his apprentice are discussing religious subjects of high scholarly value.

   — Do you know the origins of our glorious Talos, my son ?

   — Not really… Do tell !

   — Well, after the reign of the Potentates, people of Tamriel knew of Tosh Raka, and they were jealous. So rose Talos : Akavir may have a *Tiger Dragon*, but Tamriel has a *Tiber Dragon* !

   (bis.) (The Tiger Dragon of Akavir, *a.k.a. Tosh*.)

2. Lynn Haal is a Breton assassin, from Nordic fatherly ascendance. As a former
   legionary, he has had long years of practice in the field of slaughtering
   Elves. Retired after the Great War, he makes a living off his precious
   knowledge by accepting some assassination contracts. He quickly built himself
   a «good» reputation of a skilled and specialized Mer-killer.

   Moral: in order to kill Elves, you have to *pay Lynn Haal*.

3. What were the Snow Elves called before there was any snow?

   *Fall-Mer*.

4. What is the name of the school of magic Maormer use to make their vessels
   fade away into sea fog?

   *Mist-icism*.

5. What happens when a Dragonborn travels to the Shivering Isles ?

   He learns a *New Sheoth*.

6. (Herma Mora found an heretical painting.)
