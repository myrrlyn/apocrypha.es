“Do you want to give us some last words, if for nothing else than having the
memory?” Di’vaad asks

“Last words are for those who expect to lose. I don’t know the result, but I
know the methods and that’s all we have time for.” The Mane hurriedly states.

Di’vaad and Bo’nett both hop onto each of the Mane’s shoulders, holding
themselves into traditional Two-Moons-Dance stances they learned in Rawlith Khaj
temples. They concentrate what breath they can as they wait for the signal. At
the moment the Mane opens his eyes again, he roars his last words.

“Hit it!”

The beat of their blood engraves their arms from the unrelenting heat as they
punch the Mane’s jaw, breaking it wide open and hanging with loose, floppy skin.
The Mane then flings himself around both moons in a figure 8 at incredible
speeds to send his huge body flying down towards the great golden Numidium that
has only just noticed the flying fur moon speeding towards it. Unprepared,
Numidium gets eaten alive by Ri’Salli-dad-kun-jo and constrained by the internal
chamber formed by the hands of hundreds of Khajiit.

“So this is why we had to bring your lights.” Di’vaad says looking at the small
flames on Bo’nett’s shoulders.

“Well… well shit, looks like we gotta go in there” Bo’nett replies.

“It doesn’t matter how odd what we just saw was, we have to keep going!”

“He just ate a whole damn killer-robot-god in one go, give me time to deal with
that”.

The pair then enter the dark tomb that is the Mane’s new constructed self.
