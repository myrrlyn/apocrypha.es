“Holy shit.” Bo’nett says as she exhaustedly moves away in desperation. “I can
only stop it for a few seconds, I have to shine this thing quickly!” she states
as she removes a plate from Numidium’s finger.

“There’s just enough here to make a reflection” she states.

However, she notices up in the dark abyss of the Mane that just then, the eyes
of Numidium were following her and opened its mouth. “The flow of time resumes.”

Despite the terrifying power of Numidium, this does not stop her plan.

“Aha! It’s a mirror! Look, jeko, look at everything you’ve become! Look at where
the disappearance of the Dwarves led them to!” Bo’nett roars.

Contrary to the plan, Numidium doesn’t care and reconnects the plate to its
finger.

“Fine! Fuck all of it!”

Bo’nett runs up Numidium’s arm thinking how cool that is even if she is going to
die and jumps through the giant robot’s mouth.

“**You’re not killing me, I’m killing me, idiot!**…… ok, really now, that thing
had to use the Heart right? it has to have something inside here I can take
down”. Bo’nett feels around inside Numidium but can’t find any kind of heart.
What she can feel, though, is the plates of Numidium getting smaller.

“Shit, this thing can go smaller? But… no… we’re the heroes”

Numidium shrinks and Bo’nett gradually dies as her body is crushed from all
directions. Bones snap and blood rushes out wherever it can.

“If it can go smaller and kill me then that means… it can go bigger”.

Even with the blood still leaking out from the dead body of Bo’nett, Numidium
explodes in size and rips the Mane apart. With what little life he had left he
was selfishly relieved that he found where his road finished.

And the horrible fighting ended.
