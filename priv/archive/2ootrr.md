The natives of Elsweyr are famous for their many forms and tribes. When a
Khajiit is born two dice are rolled: one for their tribe of birth and one for
their moonsign, which defines their anatomy and even their relative sapience.
Despite this variety- even, perhaps, because of it- their society is chaotic but
tolerant, exuberant but harmonious. As always, however, there are exceptions to
the rule. Such are the Aldjamiir, who style themselves the ‘True Khajiit’.

The Aldjamiir inhabit a series of villages south of Torval, between the coast
and the Tenmar Forest. They farm a little, and trade a little, and brew an
unpleasantly greasy wine using root vegetables. Their settlements lack the
vibrant faded grandeur of the mainstream Khajiit cities, being more purely
functional and often visibly impoverished. Despite this they hold themselves
with a certain haughtiness, because they consider themselves the only pure stock
of their race.

All Aldjamiir embody the Ohmes morphology of the Khajiit. They resemble their
near neighbours the Bosmer in appearance and their distant cousins the Altmer in
temperament. They consciously reject the feline aspect of their race as a curse
inflicted by the devil Azurah, and practice strict reproductive discipline in
order to prevent the birth of ‘mutant’ breeds. As birth is locked into the
cycles of the moons, they revere the moon ‘Jone’ as the good aspect of Lorkhaj,
the creative and well intentioned deity. The larger moon ‘Jode’ is Lorkhaj’s
dark half, the trickster and corrupter of gods. Azurah is allied with the
latter, and the good spirits Nirni and Y’ffer with the former.

Offspring born in the wrong form are purged mercilessly by this society, and
they are loath to allow their non-Ohmes kin into their territory. They also
refuse to conduct business with wider Khajiit society, which is why they remain
so poor. They are a fatalistic people, and say that as long as Jode overshadows
Jone they will be outcasts in their own land. Many leave for Valenwood, merging
completely with the Bosmer population. Others occasionally form murderous cults
that attack Khajiit travellers in the jungle, earning them the contempt of the
normally easy-going Elsweyr population.

Perhaps surprisingly the Aldjamiir remain reverent of the more esoteric
traditions of the Khajiit, including the gathering of Moon Sugar. They also hold
wild festivals in honour of the Mane. They believe that under the great mound of
tithed fur that the Mane wears, he or she is an Aldjamiir like them. It is not
wise to try to disabuse them of this notion.
