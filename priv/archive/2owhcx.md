> Drem Yol Lok, Greetings Dovahkiin, what brings you back to my Strunmah?

For meditation, but on new Words of Power. I feel I’ve learned much about Fus,
Feim and Yol. Surely there is more I can learn, will you not instruct me on the
others?

> Unslaad Yah, you wish to learn about the Thu’um than what I have already
> taught you? You strike at my weakness for Tinvaak. Dahmann, that learning a
> word requires taking the meaning into yourself, and letting it become one with
> you inner spirit. Very well, what word calls to you Dovahkiin?

Raan.

> The word means “Animal” in your tongue. Remember that the beasts of the land
> are creations of Kaan, Kyne, and honor them as such. Also, think of your inner
> beast Dovahkiin, the primal instincts that allow you fight and survive. Recall
> the strength such base suleyk, power, gives you. That is the meaning of Raan.
> Let your inner animal guide those that you call upon to aid. Su’um ahrk morah.
> You will find that the beasts of the land will serve you longer.
