What can you tell me about the word, Zun?

> “Weapon” in your tongue. It was created by the dovah to be used against the
> joor during the Dragon War. Before Bron, Nords were taught the voice, they had
> no match against the Thu’um. Yet they would still meet us upon the Frod, field
> of battle, with their Zun, axes and swords. The dovah could easily rout them
> after using this Thu’um. Consider this Dovahkiin, how reliant are you upon
> your own Zun? How reliant, the enemy upon theirs? Strike at their weakness of
> being disarmed, the fear of being unable to defend oneself. Focus yourself on
> the mastery of the Thu’um, a weapon that none may take from you. This is the
> meaning of Zun. To use your Voice as an innate weapon, to advance conflict, or
> avoid it? Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that none will stand untouched by
> your Thu’um.
