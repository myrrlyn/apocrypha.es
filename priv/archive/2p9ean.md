What understanding do you have of Faas?

> It is called “Fear” in your tongue. One of the most ancient of the Rotmulaags,
> for fear is something that every being feels. What do you fear Dovahkiin?
> Faaz, Dinok, Funta? Pain, death or failure? Before you can exploit the Faas of
> others, you must first confront your own. You are dovah in Ziil, soul, ply the
> inborn ability to Rel, dominate and turn it against your inner most fears.
> Once you have dominated and Zind over your fears, you can exploit those of
> others. What do the joore fear, the dovah? That is the meaning of Faas, to
> command ones fears and expoloit those of others and drive them to Maar,
> terror. Su’um ahrk morah Dovahkiin. You will find that all will flee before
> your Thu’um.
