> “Air” in your tongue. The dovah are not just master of the Thu’um, we hold
> Inhus, mastery of the skies, forces of Hevno Fus, brutal physical force. When
> the Su’um runs out the dovah would turn to their claws and talons to rend
> flesh and stone. To Grah, battle, in the air requires grace and precision of
> Hadrim and Kopraan. How this applies to you is different Dovahkiin, the joore

> effortlessly, think of how you may move through the air without hindrance.
> That is the meaning of “Su” To move as the wind does, without pause or
> restraint. Su’um ahrk morah. The air will give way to your force.
