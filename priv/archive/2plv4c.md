Drem Yol Lok, Paarthurnax, I think you know why I am here.

Iiz.

> It means “Ice” in your tongue. The Rotmulaag itself is closely related to Fo,
> but carries a different meaning. Where Fo inhibits change, Iiz ceases it. The
> Thu’um itself also arose from the Dragon War. Slen, Flesh is not a part of
> this Thu’um unintentionally, it was purpose made to Grah Faal Bron, fight the
> Nords who rebelled against the Dragon Cult. Beyond being a weapon, the Thu’um
> expresses a deeper idea. The suleyk, power, to stop the changes that occurs
> due to the Vennesetiid, is one of immense Mulaag. You tamper and manipulate
> the natural processes for yourself. That is the meaning of “Iiz.” To Diin,
> freeze, those you in the stream of time. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that
> joore remain entombed for Unslaad Tiid.
