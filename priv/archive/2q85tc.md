Greetings Paarthurnax, mentor. I’ve come to meditate on a new word of power.

> Drem Yol Lok Dovahkiin. You are one of the most attentive students I have
> consuled in all the ages, what word calls to you?

Can you teach me about Strun?

> “Storm” in your tongue. You, Dovahkiin, have a special relation with this
> Thu’um. The Greybeards have greeted you as Ysmir, Dragon of the North. With
> that the title of Strundu’ual, Stormcrown. You have taken up this mantle for
> yourself and this Thu’um will allow you to harken to it. Like Talos before a
> Strun will be at your call, aiding you in Grah. You call upon Kaan’s realm
> when you use this Thu’um, she is the Goddess of the Storm, honor her as such
> and the Lok Fen Nah Gaah. Know this Dovahkiin, the storm and Kiezaal are
> deeply rooted together. Recognize the connection Strundu’ual. That is the
> meaning of “Strun.” To become one with your inner self, and mantle that which
> came before. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that the storm will last as long
> as you will it.
