Gaan, its clearly another word that wasn’t intended for worship. How do the
dragons use it most effectively?

> “Stamina” in your tongue. The Thu’um does not empower these forces within you,
> but latches on to your foes and Luv Rii Lass, tears at their very life forces.
> Its Suleyk comes from its simplicity, a dovah or warrior cannot Krif, fight,
> if they are weakened so. By draining away what is vital in life you embraces
> the Fen Wah Suleyk, will to power over those who oppose you. It comes
> naturally to the dovah, you feel it do you not Dovahkiin? Do not fall to the
> Palok of the power though, lest you become like Alduin. Think of it as this,
> drain away the essence that feeds evil and cruelty, leave that which is
> peaceful and Pruzah. That is the meaning of “Gaan” as I understand it. To
> fight those who would enslave and dominate by taking that which is vital to
> them. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that your Thu’um acts quicker and takes
> faster.
