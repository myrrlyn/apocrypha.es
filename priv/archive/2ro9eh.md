Mentor Paarthurnax, will you teach me about another Word of Power I learned
while traveling Solstheim?

> You have shown yourself Onik Ahrk Bonaar. Yes Dovahkiin, I will teach you,
> what Rotmulaag have you learned in your travels?

Ven.

> It means “Wind” in your tounge. I have consuled you on “Wuld” which allows you
> to call upon wind for travel. This Thu’um calls upon it to be used as a Zun, a
> weapon. It can be especially damaging to the dovah, when the wind is turned
> against us. Most have no choice but to land upon the Golt, ground, where we
> are weaker. When used against the joore it can sow chaos amongst their ranks,
> during the Dragon War the dovah used it to rout the Nords without direct
> combat. Think of it as this Dovahkiin, the mayhem and havoc that result from
> this Thu’um is the desired Oblaan. That is the meaning of “Ven.” Not to
> outright Krii Paal, kill all those who oppose you, but to insight panic and
> hysteria amongst your enemies. Call upon the wind to aid you in this. Su’um
> ahrk morah. You will find that the Ven will obey you for much longer.
