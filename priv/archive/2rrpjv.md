Mul.

> your true Rii, essence. Think of it as this Dovahkiin, as you become closer to
> your true self you will find that power growing inside you. Your limbs will
> assume the strength of the dovah’s claws, you will be protected as if you
> carried my scales, and you will understand the natural essence of the Thu’um.
> That is the true meaning of “Mul.” To have your outer self match your inner
