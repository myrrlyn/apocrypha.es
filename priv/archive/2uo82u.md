The names of dragons are Words of Power as well; what can you tell me about your
name Durnehviir?

> I had a name before I became enslaved by the Ideal Masters; it’s is not worth
> remembering, it is not who I am now. I took a new name, Curse-Never Dying. It
> is what I have become, this place, the Soul Cairn is what sustains me. It is
> true that the dovah Sil, soul, is eternal but our bodies can wither and fail,
> mine remains in this constant state of Liiv Unslaad. My body shall never
> perish as long as I remain in this dreadful place, beware my fate Qahnarrin,
> deal only with what can master, lest you forced to take a new name. I have
> given you my name freely because you have bested me Qahnarrin, do not give
> yours out freely. Of course many know it, but how many **know** it? Once a
> Dovah’s name is given to another, they can call them, from all places, would
> you answer their call, if you did not? Ponder the name I have given you,
> Qahnarrin. Perhaps you will know yourself better than before.
