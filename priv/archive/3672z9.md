Dear Relamus Indoril, Tribune High Priest

I hope that this message has reached you in one piece, I hear the Stonefalls are
a quite dangerous region, and I was quite worried the courier would not arrive.

I have studied the gods and goddesses of many pantheons throughout Nirn, from
the most barbaric bug-god of the current blind writhing Falmer, to the
Cyrodiilic Cult of Cuhlecain, and everything in between. However, throughout all
my studies, there has been one god that has perplexed me more than it should.
This god I speak of is your almighty Lady of Mercy, Warden of the Dunmer people,
Protector of the Tribunal faith.

Throughout my research, I have seen many claims that Almalexia is the
Anticipation of Boethiah, Prince of Plots, Queen of Destruction, Deceiver of
nations. Why would such a peace loving, protector, and healing woman such as the
Lady of Grace be associated with such a barbaric, blood spilling, god-eating
prince such as Boethiah?

Their personalities are completely opposite from eachother, and this question
has plaqued me for quite some time. None of the other ALMSIVI share this
contrast with their anticipations, only Almalexia.

Thank you,

Isobel Amatius, Imperial Scholar
