_Man builds and furbish, Mer destroy and annihilate._

_Atmora Froze and Aldmeris Sundered._

_[Atmora, the ever-frozen land, far to the north, endured no such thing as decay
or chaos](./36rg0e), the same can not be said for the land of Aldmeris, the land
of the mer. Aldmeris was land of ever-changing, no objects, no ideals, no
concepts were still, all of which change, evolve, corrupt and decay, so much so
that there are those who believe Aldmeris simply did not exist, however, that
notion is as tedious and as idiotic as the concept of Atmora being frozen in
time._

_Aldmeris used to be whole, used to be united, just like when Atmora was
sundered and crippled, but unlike Atmora, which healed and prospered, it went on
to experience decay, degeneration and damnation. The chaos it underwent was no
ordinary one, such destruction put even the deadliest, most harrowing, most
distressing wars and rebellions on Tamriel to shame, ocean dried, glacier
melted, metal rusted, building crumbled in the span of few days, ideas died,
concept torn apart, the willpower of the people sundered, Aldermis, appeared
almost like an endless city, built upon itself over and over again, until
nothing from nature remained. It was as if the time was moving faster than
usual, but alas, it was not. It was simply the laws of Aldmeris, just like the
laws of Atmora_

_Soon, the lands of Aldmeris was torn asunder by the chaos, by this rapid
entropy, not through the hands of mer that dwelled there, but rather, the land
itself. Like the first man from Atmora who came to Tamriel from their cold and
bitter lands, the mer of Aldmeris, now shattered into different groups, arrived,
too in Dawn’s beauty. From two ends of the extreme, these man and mer came to
the lands of neutrality, to Tamriel, but carried within them, are the memories
of their home, in the vein of every man, there is the will to rebuild, to
preserve, to refurbish; flowing through the blood of every mer, there is the
urge for chaos, destruction and decay so that the world might reborn and begin
anew._

_Such is the lands of Aldmeris, the land of ever-changing and reigning chaos,
and the mer it bred_

_Unknown_
