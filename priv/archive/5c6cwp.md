_(I am)_ N’gasta! Defiler! Destroyer! Never since the Dawn (or the Dusk) has
such a feat been achieved. Mortal flesh-pods _(?)_ seem unable _(or)_ unwilling
to maintain the bonds between soul and flesh beyond grave injury, a fact which
every child of tusxas _(no identifiable analog; perhaps “tusxas” is a name?)_
knows dearly in his Heart. The art of Un-Death is and always has been the
primary passion of _(our)_ great people, focused on the bending of nature to
allow PLEJ _(unknown, but Ehlnofey in origin; capitalized in some manuscripts,
lowercase in others)_ to take hold on the material and the spiritual.

Yet now, the Defiled (a name of my own invention) have been born/e
_(interchangeable)_ of Slime and of Sand for the first time in this Time.
Defile! Defeat! Great darkness seeps from the cracked skin of _(these)_
delightful abominations, who are born/e of every species, from the Merish sorts
to the goblins they keep _(as)_ pets. All sacrificed on the proper alters and
drained of blood, and all kept alive ahkstas _(“artificially”?)_ so that their
souls may know anguish. Alifsonke _(possibly “A’fsunke or “the fsun”, an Old
Ehlnofex term for crude but effective soul entrapment technologies, the
precursors to modern soul gems)_ is readied and kept in close physical proximity
to the live-corpses so that the souls may not wander too far. They are
harvested, reanimated as one, and sent forward until _(they)_ fall.

And by S’loathk _(?)_, do my beautiful Defilers never fall. They may lose limbs,
eyes, ears, tongues, or they may yet be burned alive or frozen, but still they
stand. Each corpse they claim is added to the throng, a meat-sack ready and ripe
for harvest. I am only just beginning.
