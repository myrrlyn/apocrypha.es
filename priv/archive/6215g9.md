I had a dream about Azura, Boethiah and Mephala.

They warned me that Ayem, Seht and Vehk have grown envious of my power, and my
relationship with Alandro Sul.

They warned me that they have grown dangerously interested in the secrets
beneath Red Mountain, and the power wielded by Kagrenac.

Boethiah has said that Kagrenac is an apostate, an affront to creation.

They told me I was to become Hortator of Misrule, Saviour of Aurbis, that my
bravery would shame the bones of my betrayers.

I don’t feel brave.
