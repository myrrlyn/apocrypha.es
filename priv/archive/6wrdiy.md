“Open up!” I pounded on the door again, “By order of the Emperor and through the
powers of the Balmora guard I order you to open up!”

We were not at the temple. Upon arrival there I had been promptly stonewalled
until I had threatened a Temple wide Inquisition and a formal complaint with
Lord Vivec. I had nearly beaten down the door before they admitted me in.
Priests in long flowing elaborate robes and smelling of heavy incense berated me
at every turn while I searched for Friune. Of course this had been a ruse, as
they soon admitted that he was at his home with his wife. A waste of my time and
no doubt part of their plan.

I now found myself in almost the exact same position. Once again I was pounding
on the door and making idle threats. At this point my patience had run out and I
was only a few seconds from flat out hacking at the door with my sword. From the
inside I heard scrambling around and muffled speech.

Deerkethus stood behind me with his arms wide to hold back the pressing crowd. I
heard rumblings around the people; they were indignant that an outlander would
be talking to such a well-respected priest. More than a few voices rose in
anger; they were appalled that I had the nerve to speak to him in such a manner.
Chants of _Almsivi_ and invocations of Azura swirled, along with the undernote
of “Blasphemer!” and “Outlander, n’wah, swit!”

Finally a voice came out from the other side of the door. Strong and heavy, a
male Dunmer with the raspy characteristic nature of those of Morrowind.

“I will come out Outlander.” He said, “But you must promise to not come in.”

“I promise.” I said, holding back my rage. Deerkethus spoke softly to the crowd,
urging them to disperse and informing them of the guard’s involvement in this
matter.

The door cracked open slightly and I spied a singular crimson eye peering out
from the candlelit room. The shades had been drawn and the room was nearly
pitch-black. Before he could speak, I quickly bull-rushed the door and shoulder
checked Friune roughly out of the way. The door slammed open and knocked him to
the ground and I pulled my gladius out in an open display of violence.

“Y-you p-promised!” Friune wheezed; the door and fall had knocked the wind out
of him.

“The Inquisition promises nothing!” I roared. “Your Emperor demands obedience!”

“Real smooth.” Deerkethus came in and shut the door quickly, “You’re a master of
guile sera. You’ve made enemies with that move Inquisitor.”

I shrugged my shoulders. I didn’t care. My temper had grown in the past few
days. Perhaps there was something to this town that did that to men. There was
nothing left for me to do.

The entire home was unsurprisingly Dunmer it its design; built in the standard
Balmoran style, sparse in amenities and utilitarian in its entirety. Not one
piece was for show and everything had an intended use. I noticed too that their
home shrine was probably the most lavishly decorated item in the entire house.
Expected from the high priest.

The place was barely lit. In the middle of the room, on the table, was a single
lit candle; it’s dim glow casted glowering shadows on the walls, as if the
spirits of the dead had stolen the light from the world.

Friune was dressed in a simple blue T-Tunic and loose trousers with soft
slippers. He had his black hair slicked up straight in the traditional Dunmer
Mohawk. Apart from a slightly crooked nose he was rather good looking for a
Dunmer and I estimated his age to be no less than fifty or so.

He picked himself off the ground and dusted himself, muttering curses at me and
Deerkethus. When he had caught his breath he wandered over to the table and sat
down, without offering either of us a seat.

“What do you need, Outlander?” He said at last.

“You know who I am?” I asked. He nodded his head and answered,

“You’re the foreigner scum whom claims jurisdiction in a land not of his own.
You bring the local constable’s…pet…along with you. A pet that’s deemed himself
a law enforcer, although I recognize no authority belonging to him.”

“Perhaps you’d like to take that up with the Hlallu magistrate.” Deerkethus eyes
flashed, “We’ll see whose side he takes.”

“It matters not whose side he takes,” The priest returned, “For I am on the side
of the living gods.”

I rolled my eyes. He may not recognize my authority, but I had no fear of his
gods. They were not here after all.

“Regardless.” I said, “We need to ask you some questions. Where were you on the
night of the 15th?”

“I was at the temple meditating. Alone.” He answered.

“A few days ago, you had an argument with a man named Cassius Aurelius,”
Deerkethus said, “What was the manner of this argument?”

“The man…” Friune all but seeped loathing now, “Was an Imperial and a drunk, who
defamed our temple by his mere presence. I asked him to never return and he
refused!”

“_You_ asked him?” I asked, “The High Priest? Why not an initiate or lower level
functionary?”

“The man was known for his violent temper.” Friune answered, “I would never ask
a follower to do something I wasn’t willing to do.”

“What was his answer?” Deerkethus kept one hand on his chin and circled slowly,
in thought.

“He refused and insulted the Dunmer people. We exchanged insults before leaving
each other’s presence. That was it.”

I noticed that as he told us his story that he was wringing his hands nervously
but I decided to say nothing.

“Did you strike him?” I asked plainly.

“I most certainly did not!” He answered back quickly with more than a hint of
venom.

“Why weren’t you at the temple? Why would you not allow us to come in?” I asked
plainly.

“Because,” He said with annoyance, “My wife and I are in…mourning…”

From what I can only guess was the bedroom came the sound of a slight whimper. I
knew from that sound that someone, his wife presumably, was sobbing back there.
Without waiting for permission I pushed past the priest, who gave a small shout
of protest, and I entered the bedroom.

It was as sparsely decorated as before, nothing more than a bed and a few
dressers. Along one wall a shelf stood out with a vase of newly picked flowers.
The fragrant smell filled the room and made my sinuses swell. I thought it
strange to have new flowers during the “mourning” process, but I said nothing.

Sure enough, a slight Dunmer woman sat at the foot of their bed. She was tiny,
even for a Dunmer, no taller than 5’2 or so. She was dressed in all black with a
black lace veil draped around her auburn hair. Her eyes were glossy and her face
was puffy with crying. She was stick skinny, as if she was underfed, but still
beautiful from what I could see. But I couldn’t help but notice though, a slight
discoloration on her right cheek; it was a bruise, just finished healing.

“Our cat, Outlander,” The priest squeezed past me and put a comforting arm
around his wife, “Our cat passed away last night. She was quite old you see.”

I looked at Deerkethus who shrugged. That explained the unlit nature of the
house and the barricaded door. Dunmer often spent days in solitude when a loved
one died, although I’ve never heard of such regard for a pet. I motioned to
Deerkethus to tell me the name of the wife.

“Renara,” He whispered.

“Mrs. Helera, Renara” I began and added _sera_ for effect, “Tell me, has your
husband hit you?”

Deerkethus gave me a look as if to say “_Really?_”

She opened her mouth and glared at her husband. Tentatively she shook her head
no and stared blankly at her hands. I remained silent, letting her work herself
into speaking.

“The…the Imperial did so…” She trembled, “He came to the temple and he…” She
began to speak, but stopped short and burst out into crying once more. I sighed
and rubbed my temples. This was going to be harder than expected.

“How come this was never reported to the guard?” Deerkethus glared at Friune. He
shrugged.

“Why involve the lapdogs of the Hlallu,” He sneered, “You’re the collaborators
of the Empire. I’d sooner trust a snake.”

“He just attacked…me…” Renara spoke up.

“So you’re saying the Imperial hit your wife?” I kept my tone neutral, “Why
would he attack a woman? I knew the man and he was never capable of this…”

“He was the scum on the bottom of my boots,” Friune retorted, “I don’t rightly
know why he came to the temple and attacked her. But just let me say, I’m glad
he’s dead!”

“Were there any witnesses to this assault?” I asked.

“None but myself Outlander.” The priest said smugly.

“Had he ever spoken to your wife before? If so, why would he?” Deerkethus
motioned to her, “Perhaps he thought he could get to her? She is a high
priestess”

“No, I imagine that was the first time they’ve ever spoken. He was scum and a
racist. I’m sure it was some insidious Imperial plot.” Friune spoke up and came
towards us with outstretched arms. “Now please, if you will, leave us to our
mourning. Two days is the tradition and I will be back at the temple. Ask me
more then but now I must ask you to leave.”

He started to push out towards the front door but I gripped his shoulder and
stopped him short.

“One more thing priest.” I said, “No doubt you know of Cassius’s death.”

“It is known.” He said, “I will not pray for him, for his gods were not mine.
You pray for him Outlander.”

“We had heard tales of him converting.” Deerkethus added. Friune shook his head.

“That man is not welcomed by Almsivi and never will be!” He said, and I saw the
cold gleam in his eyes.

“So you deny him seeking the Tribunal out?” Deerkethus pressed. Friune shook his
head again.

“The swit never came to me for such and if he had, I would’ve turned him away.”

“Can you tell me about the amulets you priests wear?” I followed up. “Could I
see yours?”

“I…” He trailed, “I lost it recently. I’m not sure where.”

“Interesting.” I said cloyingly; I rummaged in my pocket and produced the amulet
found on Cassius’s body. “Tell me, priest, is this one yours?”

“Why…” He seemed to hesitate and his face grew weary before turning to
determination and his face tightened with resolve. “Yes that’s mine. I remember
now. I dropped it earlier. I had noticed that the cord was fraying and I was lax
in replacing it. Thank you.”

“Is that so?” I studied his face closely and didn’t it offer it back, “Why
didn’t you mention this earlier?”

“It didn’t cross my mind.” He said simply and kept his face placid. He must’ve
gotten the message because he made no effort to retrieve it.

Deerkethus and I looked at each other and understood that this was the end of
our interview. Same as Faerdae, we would keep him under surveillance and see
what his movements were for the next few days.

Excusing ourselves quickly we stepped out back into the rain and the angry mob
that waited outside. As I pulled my hood over my head a bottle thrown from the
crowd missed me by less than a meter and shattered against the nearby wall. An
outcry was building up in a crowd of very angry Dunmer who had gathered outside
the priest’s resident.

Deerkethus gathered his cloak and stepped between me and them, barking out
orders to the closest town guards who obeyed begrudgingly. With one arm he
ducked my head down and we scurried ourselves into a nearby alley.

“I told you that was a mistake Inquisitor,” He growled at me, “The Dunmer take
their religion _very_ seriously.”

“I take my duties _very_ seriously!” I countered sarcastically, “By the power of
the Empero-“

“Whatever!” Deerkethus interrupted as we emerged in a main thoroughfare,
“Emperor this, Empire that. Listen sera, you’re in Morrowind now. You’ll get
deference and just that. The Dunmer owe you nothing more and won’t be afraid to
tell you.”

I frowned and considered his opinion. I was a stranger in this land and sure
enough, I had probably pissed off my fair share of people. Fair enough I
decided. The Argonian had a point.

“Did you notice something about him?” I changed the subject.

“He was lying.” Deerkethus thankfully understood my discomfort, “Lying and he
was clearly nervous.”

“The amulet for one is a concern,” I said “You noticed he said it must’ve been
dropped. He _specifically_ said the cord was fraying.”

“Yes,” Deerkethus said, “But the amulet we found had its cord intact. It was
removed, not broken. Not only that, but the Bosmer had said that he had procured
an amulet for Cassius.”

“So either the amulet we found belonged to Cassius, via his transaction with
Faerdae.” I pondered, “Or maybe Cassius really did take it from his neck. Is
that possible?”

“I don’t think so,” Deerkethus shook his head, “Temple Priest guard those with
their lives. No way could he lose or forget it.”

“Unless it was dropped during the murder.” I offered and Deerkethus shook his
head in skepticism. I continued.

“What’s more is, he insisted that Cassius wasn’t converting. But everyone we’ve
spoken too so far has said the opposite. Why would he be different?”

“Anyone who wishes to convert must speak to High Priest to prove their
dedication.” Deerkethus informed me, “For certain if he was doing it then Friune
would know. Why lie?”

“Why indeed?” I rubbed my chin and winced at the short bristly hairs. Since
coming to Balmora I hadn’t shaved or bathed. Not that I lacked for being wet,
for the rain was still pouring as strong as ever.

“I found something else serjo.” Deerkethus said and fished around in his pocket.
From within he pulled out a rather interesting piece of evidence. Two silver
pins, studded with rubies and sapphires. Both gems were fashioned into a
flower-shape and glittered prettily in the dim light of day. I held my breath as
I recognized the two. They were the Rose Pins of Chorrol. An expensive trinket
you could buy only in Chorrol.

“By the Nine, where did you get those?” I said swiftly and grasped them.

“You’ll find so much evidence on one’s person, serjo,” Deerkethus wiggled his
fingers, “As a slave people pay me no mind. So easy to slip into their pockets
and…relieve…them of any incriminating evidence.”

“Or plant some?” I eyed him suspiciously.

“Perhaps,” He shrugged, “But I assure you, I found those in the priest’s
pockets!”

“Talos guide me.” I said, “Didn’t Cassius accuse a F.H. of stealing something
from him?”

“Indeed,” Deerkethus offered, “But why would Friune steal these from him? What
do they have to do with Cassius?”

“I’m not sure.” I said, “We’ll have to see how this plays out. But first, I want
to get out of this rain and take a warm bath and get a bottle of-“

Before I could continue the thought I was interrupted by the sight of one of the
town guard approaching us quickly. He was out of breath and breathing heavily,
evident even through the thick bonemold armor he wore. He must’ve been assigned
to outside patrol in the marsh; I could see the muck coming up to his knees.

“Inquisitor, Deerkethus,” he said between gasps, “The slave…has been
found…just…outside of town…”

Deerkethus and I looked at each other. A breakthrough! I gathered my cloak and
gripped my gladius.

“Come Deerkethus! Swiftly!”

We hurtled through the streets, through rain and thunder, towards the main gate
and towards another clue into the mysterious death of Cassius Aurelius.
