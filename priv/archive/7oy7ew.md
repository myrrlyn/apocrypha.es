The oldest accounts of Ysgramor’s life appear in the Fragmentae Annals of Mora,
believed to date around the rule of High Priestess Kulaasdaanikgolt of Atmora in
the year 130 of the Merethic Era (ME 130), although they survive only as
incomplete copies made by the royal archivists of Winterhold in the 1st Era.

Some fifteen years prior to the Return, Ysgramor served the High Priestess as
the general of her armies. During her rule, her augers uncovered an ancient
prophecy that spoke of a foreboding blight known as the “Bromtiiddiin”. Fearing
that Atmora was doomed, Kulaasdaanikgolt ordered Ysgramor to lead a migrant
fleet to Tamriel and establish permanent holdings for the eventual mass
migration of her people.

## The Founding of Sarthaal

Although the Atmorans had been migrating to the southern continent for
generations, it was typically malcontents, dissidents, and rebels who were no
longer welcome in Atmora. This marked the first time a large fleet would cross
the Sea of Ghosts in search of a new home. Ysgramor led a fleet of ships and
longboats south to the mainland in ME 130. His own ship, The Skerd, carried
members of his own clan and most loyal warriors.

Landfall was made on the northern coast and Ysgramor quickly ordered the
construction of the first human city, Saarthal. With an entire army of craftsmen
and workers at his disposal, the city began to grow rapidly. The Annals reveal
that Ysgramor received several emissaries and envoys from the various elven
rulers of the land, and relations were typically cordial, albeit distant.

What caused the elves to turn on Ysgramor is still debated by scholars. Some
claim they took exception to the temples dedicated to foreign gods that the
Atmorans built on their land, others claim they feared mankind’s rapid
expansion, while others assert a sect of fanatical elves coveted an ancient
artifact the Atmorans discovered deep underground during the expansion of
Sarthaal, and sought to take it for themselves. Regardless, in ME 120, the elves
attacked Saarthal and killed almost all of its inhabitants. Ysgramor and his two
sons survived and fled back to Atmora only to find the high priestess was
deathly ill and murmurs of a civil war were rife. Atmora had changed in
Ysgramor’s absence and was no longer his home. He gathered his legendary Five
Hundred Companions and set sail for Skyrim, or “Mereth” as he later named it.

## The Return

When Ysgramor returned to the shores of Skyrim in ME 119, he brought with him
the collective wrath of Elder Wood. The Five Hundred Companions landed at
Hsaarik Head and quickly laid waste to the north, as countless elves were
slaughtered and their towns and villages set aflame. The Five Hundred moved
together as one loose army in any given direction. This enormous wave of death
an destruction utterly terrified the native elves, who would often flee their
towns at the first sight of the Atmoran Horde.

Arch-Sage Selgriath, the ruler of the elves, quickly became aware of the
slaughter in the north and sent envoys to Ysgramor in an attempt to make peace.
After Ysgramor killed his messengers, he responded by sending an entire army of
sorcerers. The Vanguard of Magnus clashed with Ysgramor’s army at the foothills
of Shearpoint, and accounts speak of ice-magic raining down on them for two days
and nights as colossal Frost Atronachs cleaved though the Companion’s ranks.
Ysgramor, hardened by the bitter winters of Atmora, mocked the elven offense as
“but a mild chill” and was ultimately victorious.

A tome recovered from the underground remains of the elven capital, Arthalaan,
speaks of Ysgramor’s attack on the great city. After marching his army south
across the hot springs of modern-day Eastmarch, he arrived at the city gates and
bellowed a speech at Arthalaan itself:

> _By the grace of the Shor, witness the all-embracing Harbinger of the Northern
> Horde. Hearken my words!_
>
> _Know thou that on this day thy wicked transgressions against Sarthaal must be
> answered for. Kyne herself bade me to claim this land of ice and snow. For it
> was on this soil that her exalted breath gave birth to my kin, and it is to
> this soil we Return to claim what is ours. Through her blessing, all empires
> from the rising of the sun to its setting will be given to us and we will own
> them._
>
> _Blessed Wuuthrad drove our ships to this new land and its edge begged to meet
> thine all-too-many necks. As thy soft green fields whisper tales of gore I ask
> thee: beg not for mercy, or lay down thy swords, or rebuild thy ruins. We hath
> no longer use for thy peace or trust, and it shan’t win the day for thy ilk._
>
> _We are thine overlords and ne’er shall we return to the land of the midnight
> sun from whence we came. We will fight, singing and crying, until Sovngarde
> calls._

The destruction of Arthalaan and her citizens was total. A city numbering in the
thousands was exterminated over the course of a few days. While countless sagas
and eddas glorify Ysgramor’s conquest of the elves, what actually occurred in
Arthalaan was nothing less than a genocide. Elven women, children, elderly, even
their livestock and pets. Nothing was spared. According to legend, Arch-Sage
Selgriath and his ruling council were supposedly brought before Ysgramor after
the city’s sacking and publicly beheaded. Their heads were mounted on pikes of
conjured ice and planted atop a hillock of elven corpses, where they were said
to have remained intact for years. Some elves were allowed to flee the city in
order to spread the word of Ysgramor’s coming, while those who remained were
enslaved.

Ysgramor built his great capital city at the mouth of the White River, and named
it Windhelm. He declared himself High King and named his dynasty the House of
Skerd, after the honored ship that originally brought him to Skyrim. His
unrelenting campaign of elven extermination continued after the fall of
Arthalaan. He gathered the captains of his fleet: Ylgar the Bear of Forelgrin,
Jeek of the River, Ingjaldr White-Eye, Rhorlak the Unflinching, Gurilda
Sharktooth, Freida Oaken-Wand and many others, and sent them to the four corners
of Mereth, declaring:

> _“Go forth into the belly of this new land. Drive the wretched from their
> palaces of idleness. Oblige them to squalor and toil, that they would see
> their betrayals as the all-sin against our kind. Give no quarter. Show no
> kindness. For they would not give nor show you the same.”_

With much of their leadership dead, the remaining elves that weren’t killed were
said to be driven into the bowels of the land itself. As more and more warriors
and mercenaries arrived from Atmora, the vast cities that the elves inhabited
were utterly razed and the rubble used to build the foundations of the great
Nordic cities that replaced them. Saarthal was rebuilt larger and stronger.
Whiterun was established in the south. Winterhold to the north and Dawnstar to
the west. The revenge of the Night of Tears had been satisfied a hundred-fold.

Ysgramor then turned his attention to the numerous Giant clans that plagued the
land. He waged war against them and personally killed hundreds, including High
Chieftain Sinmur himself.

## Later Life

By the time Ysgramor was around 80 years old, historians speculate that he may
have felt his time on Nirn coming to an end, and his actions in his later years
was ensuring his work would live on after his passing. Chroniclers report of him
spending hours conversing with the elder wizards and clever men of his court,
discussing the nature of the afterlife, philosophy and religion.

He became more focused on the intricacies of nation building and developed a
writing system to transcribe Nordic speech using elven principles of writing.
Nordic speech (or Old Nord) at the time was completely separate to the language
of dragons, which itself was strictly reserved for those in the priesthood. The
Songs of the Return speaks of his inspiration:

> _“…yet I had beheld during my captivity that the wily Elves possessed much
> learning and knowledge, though they put it to ends both vile and dishonorable.
> And I bethought me that to defeat the Elves and scour them from the land, it
> would be well if Men also did wield such wisdoms… And I vowed that henceforth
> all Men would record their ideas and thoughts, just as Shor carved a record of
> his victory over Sneggh into the side of Shivering Glacier.”_

Ysgramor was fascinated by the almost magical nature of the written word and
knew that if his descendants were to not only dominate, but build
continent-spanning empire, they would need to learn it. He gathered the wisest
elven nobles he kept as slaves and learned from them proper ways of civil
administration and government.

Ysgramor ruled his kingdom for a further ten years, until his death in ME 99.
Skyrim mourned greatly, and many couldn’t even come to terms with the fact he
was a mortal who died a natural death. Contemporary texts almost always refer to
his death in terms such as “his passing” or “ascent to Sovngarde”.

Although a grand tomb was prepared from him below Windhelm, the Harbinger chose
to be buried in a traditional Atmoran barrow facing Atmora. He was succeeded by
his son and right-hand, Ylgar, the Bear of Forelgrin.
