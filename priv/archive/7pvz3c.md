The death of the child-king Jafnhar was a turning point in the history of Skyrim
(or "Keizaal" as it was known as under dragon rule). It marked the point when
the will of the Atmorans was broken and priesthood assumed full control of
Ysgramor’s kingdom. The mastermind behind the coup was a newly appointed high
priest named Miraak. Miraak was born in Skyrim shortly after first wave of
priests arrived in ME 95. His parentage remains unknown, but they were no doubt
part of the priesthood. Much of his early life remains a complete mystery, other
than he too joined the priesthood as a novitiate and studied at the remote
[Valthume Chantry][Valthume] under high priest Hevnoraak.

Mikaak, unlike any other before him, was gifted in an extraordinary manner. He
was a Dragonborn. The first of many throughout history. According to the _Tract
of the Allegiance Guide_ written by Miraak himself, he came to know of this
power when he witnessed a sky-battle between two dragons vying for territory in
at the summit of the Throat of the World. One of the dragons, mortally wounded,
fell from the sky and perished. Miraak approached the corpse and without warning
began to absorb its very soul. The victor of the battle, [Sahrotaar], witnessed
this astonishing feat and made Miraak as his student. The tract reads:

> _…and as I beheld the clash of the blessed Dovah in the skies above, I wept
> tears of sorrow. Noble [Kahvozein] slain at the Monahven. Brit grah. To
> prepare the burial mound I neared the \[untranslatable\] uttering the Chant of
> Consecration and Apology. My \[heart?\] began to burn in a fire of holy
> incandescent light as Kahvozein’s \[essence?\] filled my \[soul?\].
> Vonmindoraan! Sahrotaar then spake and said unto me: "Sossedov joor!? By long
> tradition, the elder speaks first. Hear my Thu’um! Feel it in your bones.
> Match it, if you are Dovahkiin!" His Thu’um washed over…_
>
> _\[the remainder of the tract is missing\]_

Being Dragonborn afforded Miraak enormous influence within the priesthood. He
quickly rose through the ranks and held influence with several high priests.
When Miraak became aware of the priesthood’s distaste of [Totem-King
Heimverlund], he orchestrated a plot to assassinate him and his entire clan and
take power. The high priests were in agreement, and although Heimverlund
survived his clan’s massacre in Windhelm, he was in no position to rule and was
ousted from the ruling council. Miraak took his place, cementing the
priesthood’s total control over Skyrim in ME 62.

## Miraak’s Iron Fist

Within a year of taking power, all manner of civil unrest was extinguished as
the ruling council tightened its grip on Skyrim and began subjecting the
populace to immense cruelty. Dragons terrorized the countryside, entire towns
were made into slaves and forced build grand temples, tombs and and shrines. One
of the more notable tragedies was the rebellious village of Vundeheim, which was
completely reduced to ash after a high priest conjured an [unending lightning
storm][Storm Call] upon it as punishment. With the people cowed into submission,
the priesthood continued its subjugation for many years. The borders of Skyrim
expanded rapidly to the south and west, into present day Falkreath hold and the
Reach respectively. Historians speculate that with dragonkind protecting them,
the priesthood could have expanded further were in not for the mighty Jerall and
Druadach mountain ranges slowing down their slave army.

By ME 09, Miraak wielded immense power second only to the dragons themselves.
Some of the elder priests had died and their title and masks passed onto their
successors, but Miraak remained steadfast in his position as de-facto leader of
the priesthood. That was until an event prophesied for untold generations came
to pass. Alduin the World-Eater awoke and descended upon Skyrim.

## The Treacherous Dragonborn

For most of the priesthood, the arrival of Alduin to herald the end times is
what they had been waiting for. According to their beliefs, a second eternal
life was promised to those who ascended to the priesthood when the World-Eater
returned. However, Alduin grew proud and chose to forsake his proper role as
World-Eater in favor of conquering Mundus for himself and his fellow dragons.
This resulted in a reign of cruelty upon the Atmorans that surpassed the
lordship of the priesthood.

Miraak had other ambitions. According to an ancient manuscript found in the
Grand Archives of Bromjunaar, Miraak refused to kneel and forsook his masters.
With the power of the dragon blood within him, he no longer consider Alduin to
be his lord, but his role as the de-facto leader of the priesthood did little to
sway the other high priests.

In an effort to assert his authority Miraak did the unthinkable. He climbed to
the highest towers of Bromjunaar and bellowed Alduin’s name, challenging the
World-Eater himself. Panic broke out in the streets below and his fellow priests
drew their daggers at the sight of such blasphemy. Alduin didn’t heed his
challenge, but instead three of his most loyal Dovah descended upon Miraak. The
ensuing battle didn’t last long as Miraak unleashed a barrage of Shouts. As each
Dragon fell, Miraak grew more powerful until all three were slain. In the
aftermath, Miraak summoned his old master Sahrotaar, who was enraged at his
betrayal. Miraak enslaved him with a Shout unknown to the Dovah, forcing him
into his service. The priesthood was no longer useful to Miraak, so left
abruptly for the island of Solstheim with Sahrotaar and his most devout
acolytes.

The other high priests soon learned where he had fled to and sent one of their
own, a priest named Vahlok, alongside numerous dragons to kill the heretic. The
Battle of Tahrodiis Dovahkiin, as it was later named, raged for two days.
Numerous Skaal tapestries depict this supposedly destructive battle in vivid
detail. The sky is always emblazoned with fire. Mountains are shown to be
crumbling into rubble and the earth is torn asunder. While the veracity of these
accounts is debatable, what we do know is the dragons burned Miraak’s temple to
the ground before he slayed each and every one of them with his immense power.
Vahlok and Miraak eventually met on the battlefield, but the details of their
encounter was lost to history and Miraak was never seen again.

Although Miraak’s rule was largely forgotten about in later eras after his name
was purged from the Annals, his rebellion was of monumental importance.
Historians attribute Miraak’s defiance as the inspirational spark which ignited
a full scale war against the Dragons and the priesthood. Leading this rebellion
was hero named Valdimar Fireforge.
