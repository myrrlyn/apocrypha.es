![Einarth of the East][banner]

Jarl Einarth from the House of Fjora was the favorite nephew of King Hjornskar,
and much like his uncle, Einarth was resolute in expanding the borders of the
kingdom. While Hjornskar focused on expanding west, Einarth was embroiled in a
war with the Chimer of the east. Numerous poetic eddas depict Einarth as the
most savage and bloodthirsty of Nordic kings. So much so that he was said to
consume the hearts of his slain enemies on the battlefield. Such savagery led to
some scholars to theorize that he was possibly a lycanthrope of some
description. While mythical accounts are known to exaggerate, history as shown
that Einarth was indeed a formidable warrior-king who expanded much of the
kingdom.

## The Battle of the Cinder Valley

From his base in Riften, he commanded a large army that frequently clashed with
the Chimer along the Cinder Valley: a narrow mountain pass that cut through the
Velothi Mountains and into Morrowind (or Veloth as it was known then). The
period of High Velothi Culture had long passed and the Chimer at the time has
devolved into warring tribes. One of the largest tribes was ruled by a fearsome
warlord named [Virak][0], who laid claim to the Cinder Valley. For eight years,
Jarl Einarth had little success in pushing his forces through the pass. Virak
had heavily fortified the valley with numerous barricades, trenches and magical
barriers. According to legend, countless Daedra were said to roam the pass, and
as night fell the dead warriors that littered the valley would reanimate and
stand guard.

When Einarth became High King, his immediately ordered his numerous armies to
descend upon Riften for a great push into the Cinder Valley. In 1E 61, a vast
army gathered at the foothills of the Velothi Mountains and forced their way
into the valley. After much bloodshed, the king’s Voice masters destroyed the
fortifications and Einarth led his forces to the summit of Mount Trolhetta, were
Warlord Virak made his last stand. Virak was said to have summoned countless
Daedra to aid him, but ultimately he was slain by Einarth himself. After the
battle, Einarth’s battle-journals reveal that he stood at the summit of
Trolhetta and gazed south to the Heartlands of Cyrodiil:

> …As I beheld a glimmering white spire piercing thro’ the jungles o’er the
> southern peaks, I held my axe to the neck of an ash-heathen and he spake
> hastily… The wretched elf told of yet more of his accursed kin who thronged
> the south!? By Shor, before I complete my count of days, their doom I will see
> to.

Einarth never had the opportunity to wage war with the Ayleids. In his lust for
conquest, he had already made numerous commitments to reclaim other lands. Of
these campaigns, the most grave was his attempt to take the Reach.

## Fall of Atmora

Einarth was the last monarch to receive settlers from Atmora, after two battered
ships laden with corpses begged to make port in Windhelm in 1E 68. They were
identified as the Snow-Whale clan — or what was left of them. Years prior, they
were the only Atmoran clan to stubbornly refused King Valdimar’s offer to
migrate to Skyrim, when he sought to bolster its population.

Their arrival implied they no longer had a choice to stay, and those who
survived the journey were reduced to insanity as they screamed that the
“freezing hath taken Hvergvalinn”. What was truly meant by this is debated by
scholars to this day, but what is known is that according to Atmoran myth
Hvergvalinn was a revered and ancient frost-oak that grew in the Hviturfjall
Valley. Legend states Shor himself planted the tree during the Dawn Era when the
Atmorans first appeared on the continent, and from a seed grew the first
frost-oak — “Hvergvalinn the Father”.

The ancient Eldergleam is said to be a one of its cuttings that took root in
Skyrim in the Middle Merethic Era (although some historians claim otherwise).
Other tales speak of Shor crafting his legendary spear from one of its enormous
branches to fight against foreign gods, or Kyne building her nest at the very
peak so she may watch over her worshippers.

## The Brass City

Before the Dragon War, the Reach was considered to the furthest borders of the
kingdom and was notoriously difficult to tame due to its harsh terrain. Despite
this, several settlements were founded and prospered. In 1E 74, Einarth’s scouts
reported of a vast gleaming city that supposedly appeared out of nowhere.

Einarth led a brigade west to the abandoned city of Ragnvald, deep in the
Druadach Mountains. Upon arrival, chroniclers report that they discovered
enormous domed towers of brass and stone piercing through the mountains. As if
the city was emerging from the earth itself. Of course we know today that these
structures belonged to the Dwarves, but to the early Atmorans their origins were
a complete mystery.

Towers and structures such as these were dotted across the kingdom since the
time before Ysgramor, but were found to be utterly impregnable. Numerous
attempts (many by Ysgramor himself) at forcing entry had proved futile, and
because there appeared to be no signs of life within they were eventually
ignored — considered ancient ruins of a long dead civilization.

After the interrogation of his Chimer prisoners from the battle at Trolhetta,
Einarth learned that a people hitherto unknown dwelled deep beneath his kingdom.
His battle-lust unabated, Einarth marched his brigade to the enormous brass
gates of Nchuand-Zel (known today as Markarth) to wage war. The Annals contain
the eye-witness account of what occurred next:

> …and just as our lord did approach the gate, four colossal brass idols were
> brought to life by some form of vile elven magic. They swiftly descended upon
> us, hissing and roaring. Though he fought valiantly and felled two of the
> possessed golems, the king was slain. I desired nothing more than die in
> battle with my liege, but was ordered to hie back to Windhelm and deliver the
> news to the Skerd-Queen.

News of Einarth’s death was met with great sorrow across the land. His body was
never recovered from the Reach, but a large ceremony in Windhelm was held in his
honor regardless. King Einarth’s successor was his younger brother, Thane Hrogar
of Riften, who would later famously become known as Hrogar Brass-Bane.
