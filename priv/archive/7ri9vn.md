![Hrogar Brass-Bane][banner]

Thane Hrogar of Riften ascended to the throne in 1E 75 after the death of his
brother, High King Einarth. He served as his brother’s right-arm throughout his
war with the Chimer, and was even with him when he took Mount Trolhetta. While
his brother favored the sword, Hrogar was a savant in the magical arts and was a
powerful war-wizard. Having studied under the venerable Magus Hrisskar of
Snowhawk, historians often compare his mastery to that of the Telvanni magisters
of today.

Hrogar’s rule was largely characterized by his war with the Dwarven city of
Nchuand-Zel, more commonly known today as Markarth, which led to him being given
the alias “Brass-Bane”. Long have scholars debated why the Dwarves remained
hidden underground while Ysgramor and his Companions slaughtered the Snow Elves
on the surface during the Return. Surely an alliance with their kin would’ve
benefited both parties, and possibly driven the Atmorans from Tamriel
completely? Possibly the Dwemer were at war with the Snow Elves themselves or
saw an alliance as beneath them? Regardless, scholarly conundrums are outside
the scope of this book and we can only speculate the motives of the mysterious
Dwarves.

## The Battle of Nchuand-Zel

Prior to his death, High King Einarth sought to reclaim the lands of the Reach,
but was killed after provoking the city of Nchuand-Zel. Vowing to exact revenge
on those who killed his brother, Hrogar pledged to return to the Dwarven city
and put it to the sword. In 1E 77, he amassed the largest army Skyrim had ever
seen, consisting of thousands from across the kingdom. Companions, Tongues,
sorcerers, healers, conscripted slaves, siege mammoths and war-beasts all
marched west. And so began a decade long conflict known as the First Sunken
Crusade.

Their initial attack on the city was slow to begin with. Despite their prowess,
the Shouts of the Voice masters were completely ineffective against the gates of
Nchuand-Zel. Siege warfare was out of the question as the Dwemer were completely
self-sufficient underground. The Dwarves seemed content to simply keep up their
defenses, and not engage Hrogar’s army — an act which infuriated the typically
stoic king.

After Hrogar realized their Shouts were beings dissipated by the numerous
spinning devices that lined the city walls (known today as Tonal Harmonizers),
he had them destroyed allowing his men to breech the gates and invade the city.
Details of this long and bloody war and surprisingly fragmented. Many of
Hrogar’s battle-chroniclers were slain in battle, and those who survived
recorded what the could in the unfamiliar dark tunnels and chambers of the city.

Tales of Atmorans fighting an unending stream of brass constructs were numerous,
more so than battle with the Dwarves themselves. The Sphere construct was the
most common among the infantry, seemly built for war, but it was almost always
accompanied by an auxiliary unit of Ballistae. In one of the first battles,
Hrogar was said to have felled a colossal Centurion singlehandedly. After his
victory he tore off its head as a trophy and fashioned it into his famed brass
helm.

## Tonal Warfare

The times when the Dwarves did take to the field of battle, they proved
formidable warriors. Their sorcerers were well versed in Tonal Magic and often
used it in their offensive. When the Atmoran’s first clashed with them, they
were said to be utterly dumbfounded by their Thu’um-like abilities that matched
their own. Their belief was that Kyne had blessed the Thu’um to Mankind alone,
so for Elves to posses this power was incongruous. Unable to reconcile this
fact, they eventually settled on the belief that the Dwarves had somehow
captured the power of their own shouts, and were channeling it back at them.
Dwarven Tonal Magic was formidable, and accounts speak of their tonal devices
inducing paranoia and terror in the Atmorans minds.

Dwarven arms and armor were known to far surpassed the Atmorans’ — both in
strength and durability. Such was Hrogar’s fascination with them that he ordered
slain Dwarves be completely looted of their equipment, and it be sent to the
surface where his plunder-caravans awaited.

The war against Nchuand-Zel dragged on for years, repeating itself in an almost
cyclical manner. Each time Hrogar’s army won a key battle and ventured deeper
into the underground city, they faced greater resistance and were eventually
forced to fall back to the surface and recover. This gave the Dwarves time to
rebuild and repair their fallen automatons, ready for the next wave from the
surface.

## Stalemate

Although Hrogar’s duty to Ysgramor’s Decree urged him to continue his decade
long campaign, he realized that a prolonged war against Nchuand-Zel was utterly
unsustainable, and it wouldn’t be long before he had exhausted every last
soldier under his charge. Even if he did eventually take the city, holding the
deepest parts would have proved impossible. While many of his predecessors would
have gladly fought till the last man, Hrogar refused to risk the kingdom he so
loved. And so in the winter of 1E 87 Hrogar ordered his men to cease and simply
march home.

The response was mixed back in Windhelm. Many among the court understood the
wisdom in Hrogar’s withdrawal, but others were furious and called his actions
cowardly. Although his army had plundered countless riches, arms and technology
from the depths of Nchuand-Zelm, Hrogar was deeply troubled by his failure and
no longer considered himself worthy to rule as High King. In 1E 88, Hrogar
surprisingly abdicated the throne and imposed exile onto himself. He was last
seen departing from Windhelm and sailing east, never to be heard of again. A
fragment of his parting speech was recorded as follows:

> …O blessed children of Kyne, hearken my words for they will be my last. Know
> that I have brought the greatest of shame unto the House of Skerd. There is no
> doubt in my heart that the Eternal Harbinger, Ysgramor himself, would cast me
> from his kingdom, if he still drew breath. My failure against the vile elves
> who throng beneath us will eternally haunt my soul, and there is no place in
> Sovngarde for my ilk. Until my honor is restored I am unworthy to face mighty
> Tsun and no welcome will I find in Shor’s lofty hall. It is for this reason I
> must leave this land and find my own path to… \[the rest of the speech is
> missing\]

Hrogar’s cousin, [Bjarfrud Skjoralmor][0] from the House of Asbjorn, was
convinced to take the throne, much to his regret.
