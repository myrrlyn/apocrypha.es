![Vundheim Silver-Hand][banner]

Before becoming High King, Vundheim Silver-Hand of House Asbjorn served as
Harbinger of the Companions in Whiterun. He earned his position at a relatively
young age when he single-handedly hunted down and killed an entire pack of
werewolves who had been terrorizing the farmsteads of Whiterun Hold for years.
His deeds made him famed across the land and [Jarl Gjalund][0] of Whiterun
bestowed unto him the title of Harbinger shortly after. This ancient and well
respected position dated back to the founding of Whiterun and original Five
Hundred Companions.

Although the original Five Hundred had dispersed throughout the land seeking
glory in conquest, the crew of the Jorrvaskr remained as a distinct group. Many
attribute this to their leader, Jeek of the River, who was charged by Ysgramor
himself as the keeper of the original Oath of the Companions. This sacred oath
decreed that Jeek’s crew would not seek conquest, but serve as eternal
protectors for the less war-gifted of the land. Jeek and his predecessors upheld
this oath (particularly during the chaos of the Dragon War) and the Companions
of Whiterun endured into the First Era.

When Harbinger Vundheim ascended to the throne the role of the Companions
changed, and they became charged as his personal honor guard. The ruling caused
much strife between the Companions and clan Stormcrag, who were traditionally
granted the sole right to serve as the king’s guard since the time of High King
Valdimar.

## The Nation Builder

Vundheim had a reputation as a fair and honorable man of a gracious and
level-headed nature who encouraged education and improved his kingdom’s legal
system, military structure and his people’s quality of life.

He vehemently disagreed with his predecessor’s campaign to invade Cyrodiil, and
despite their initial victory at the First Battle of Pale Pass he chose not to
follow through with another attack. A true man of the people, he spent vast
amounts from the general coffers strengthening the kingdom from within before
expanding its borders. A choice that made him several enemies within his own
clan.

Under his rule he established the towns of H’roldan and Granite Hill, both of
which prospered and earned him great acclaim. He also created the famed
[Winterblade Arena in Windhelm][1]. The arena was a huge success and it would
regularly attract thousands of visitors to watch the various duels, contests and
displays of might. On occasion, the king himself would partake in the revelry,
much to the crowd’s delight.

He also formed the First Council of the Hawk in 1E 108 to oversee numerous
religion reforms. Most notable was the codification of the kingdom’s official
pantheon, know today as the Nordic Pantheon. While most of the populace had
already abandoned the worship of totemic animals in favor of the gods
themselves, the council’s ruling established it as law. In addition, numerous
scriptures and texts were established as authoritative and entered into the
canon.

## Regicide

Although by the end of his eleven year rule King Vundheim was a much loved among
his people, he met his fate at the end of an assassin’s arrow while on a hunting
expedition on the plains of Whiterun. The assailant remained a mystery, but
speculation over who had him killed was rife. Vundheim’s policy on expansion had
made numerous enemies over the years.

The Companions of Whiterun were disgraced for failing to protect their king, and
were immediately discharged as the king’s honor guard. The Companions fall from
grace eventually resulted in the once-esteemed protectors devolving into mere
soldiers for hire. No better than mercenaries, they long sought redemption and
the chance to regain their honor.

The High King’s assassination heralded a dark period in the history of the
kingdom and House Skerd as internal political strife grew. Various jarls,
nobility and clan chieftains, despite pledging fealty to the High King,
squabbled frequently among themselves over land, power, and the expansion of the
kingdom. In an effort to put an end to the conflict, the nobility petitioned for
Valdar the Far-Sighted to become the next High King.

Valdar, a wise but reclusive scholar and the younger brother of King Vundheim,
ascended to the throne in 1E 110.
