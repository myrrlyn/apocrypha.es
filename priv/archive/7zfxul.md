> _by High Chronicler Valerius of Winterhold_

Haknir was the grandson of the legendary [King Hjornskar], and the first member
of his House to ascend to the position of High King since the era of the
aforementioned patriarch.

According to legend, after his predecessor disappeared Haknir seized the crown
by simply marching into the Palace of the Kings, sitting on Ysgramor’s throne
and announcing to the royal court that if any objected to his rule, they would
be required to challenge him for it. Not a single noble protested and for good
reason. Haknir was arguably one of the most formidable warriors of the First
Era.

Myths and legends surrounding Haknir are endless. Ranging from his childhood
exploits, battle prowess, sexual conquests, physical strength and even his beard
(which was said to be so large and impressive that it was tended to by no less
than four beard-maidens.) Enormous in size, many speculated he was a half-giant
or descended from the old “karstaag-men” of Atmora.

Like his grandfather, Haknir was a Tongue but his Thu’um was said to surpass
Hjornskar’s ten-fold. Legends claim that on one occasion he became so enraged in
dealing with his squabbling court that his Voice destroyed the entire eastern
wing of Ysgramor’s Palace. Another account speaks of the time his Thu’um
extinguished the Great Fire of Riften that engulfed the city in 1E 118. Such was
the power of his Thu’um that he was often seen wearing a gag (indeed his statue
in Windhelm depicts him as such), but historians believe this it was merely worn
to put his terrified subjects at ease, as opposed to it actually being effective
in suppressing his formidable Voice.

## The Ayleid Message

In 1E 133, a foreign messenger appeared at the Palace of the Kings with an
urgent message for the High King. The messenger was spared by the royal guard,
possibly due the fact he was recognizably human in appearance, although
certainly not Nordic. The Annals speak of the messenger disparagingly as “a
shivering, frail half-breed, too feeble to be considered a child of Kyne”. We
know today that this messenger was almost certainly a Nedic slave who had been
sent from Cyrodiil with a message.

Haknir was given a Memory Crystal which delivered an admonishing speech from an
Ayleid sorcerer-king named Gordhaur the Shaper. A part of which reads as
follows:

> _O false thrall-king, hearken the words of thine eternal overlords. For
> generations we hath graciously granted your ancestors the right to thrive the
> northern lands unchecked and undisturbed. Like a plague of vermin, your ilk
> hath multiplied ten-fold and spread to the four corners of the land, bearing
> fruit that is ready for the harvest._
>
> _Though baffled we are, for your kind hath neglected to submit yourselves of
> thine own accord thus forcing our hand to send this messenger. Verily, not
> only your southern kinsmen but even irrational animals, nay, the very elements
> which go to make up the world machine recognize that your insolent race was
> spared for one reason and one reason alone. To serve us._
>
> _We, therefore, following the example of our Ancestors, do earnestly command
> you hie post-haste to the Temple of White-Gold where you shall submit your
> kinsmen to us, and that after such grievous offenses you conciliate by a
> fitting penance the wrath of Auri-El, which without doubt you have seriously
> aroused by such provocation. Failure to do so will incur… [the rest of the >

Haknir was said to have bellowed heartily with laughter for hours at the Ayleid
king’s commandment before immediately preparing for war. When the messenger
returned to Cyrodiil with Haknir’s answer, the northern Ayleid city-states of
Ninendava, Rielle, and Sedor prepared their armies for an invasion into Skyrim.

The Ayleids, in their hubris, neglected the fact that Haknir’s kingdom was
arguably the most defensible kingdom in Tamriel. Skyrim was surrounded by vast
mountain ranges: The Velothi, Jerall, and Druadach ranges formed a natural
barrier that made a land invasion incredibly difficult. To the north was the
perilous Sea of Ghosts which only the Atmorans could sail unscathed.

As expected, the Ayleid’s attempt to push through the scarce few mountain passes
was disastrous. Haknir had ordered his forces to muster along the entire length
of the Jerall Mountains and fortify all routes into his kingdom. The War of the
Jeralls, as it was later named, raged for several months and largely consisted
of numerous battles and skirmishes along the border. In the east, Haknir’s
forces were able to push through into Cyrodill via Stonefells and continue
fighting in elven soil, whereas his defenses around Pale Pass were broken giving
the Ayleids a minor foothold in Skyrim.

## The Exiled Dovah

In the winter of 1E 134 Haknir was on the verge of victory when unexpectedly an
enormous Dragon appeared from deep within the Jeralls and attacked his forces.
Vukeinziivul was fearsome dragon dating back to the Dragon War, and was thought
to have been one of Alduin’s generals. After King Valdimar’s forces banished the
World-Eater, Vukeinziivul fled south into Cyrodiil with the dragon priest
Korthosiis, his most devout servant. Among the Ayelid sorcerer-kings they were
given refuge in exchange for their allegiance - and for centuries they plotted
their revenge.

Numerous battle-chroniclers have recorded that when Haknir received word that a
dragon-of-old had resurfaced and entered the war, an unrestrained battle-lust
possessed him. He immediately tore off his prized Stalhrim breastplate and ran
half-naked up the Jerall mountains Shouting Vukeinziivul’s name, interjected
with expletives and profanities. According to legend, when he reached
Vukeinziivul’s roost, Haknir single-handedly fought with both the priest and his
master in an unrelenting battle of Thu’ums. The skies above were said to have
rumbled with a deafening thunder for two days and nights and several avalanches
were triggered all across the mighty Jeralls, engulfing soldiers from both
sides.

On the third day, Haknir descended from the summit - bloodied but victorious. By
his own account, he first dispatched the priest with a Shout that flung him from
the summit. After weakening Vukeinziivul with his mighty Thu’um, he crushed his
skull with the Vulpine Scepter. Although Vukeinziivul had been slain, the
scepter (formerly symbolic of Nordic kingship) was destroyed in the process. In
response, Haknir tore out the bones from Vukeinziivul’s carcass and forged what
we now know today as the mythical Jagged Crown to serve as the new symbol of his
rule. The legendary battle was later immortalized in the well-loved eddic poem
“Haknirsmál” (The Ballad of Haknir) which today remains a favorite in taverns
across the land.

## Blood Fever

With Vukeinziivul eliminated, the remaining Ayleid forces fled from the field of
battle and back to their lands. Haknir then spent the next several years
preparing his kingdom for a full scale invasion into Cyrodiil by building a
network of roads and tunnels along the Jerall mountain passes to serve as
highways.

Unfortunately for Haknir, he didn’t live to see that day. In 1E 143 he became
deathly ill with a potent blood-fever which completely incapacitated the
once-fearsome king. The royal mystics claimed he had fallen foul to an old
Atmoran curse from his battle with Korthosiis, but the truth of the matter was
that blood-fever was common among the Nords of the time, albeit primarily with
peasants and the like.

Haknir’s shamans attempted to search for a cure through the long-dead practice
of reading the entrails of sacrificed mammoths, but it was of no use and he
eventually passed. His funeral was a grand affair. Held in Windhelm, he had a
longboat prepared him, decked with treasure, mead and tapestries. No less than
twenty elven slaves were said to have been sacrificed and placed with his corpse
before it was set alight and driven into the Sea of Ghosts.

Haknir’s successor was the young Jarl of Windhelm, Harald Hand-Free from the
House of Fjora. One of Haknir’s most trusted generals from the war, he ascended
to the throne in 1E 143 and later became one of the most noted High Kings in
Nordic history.
