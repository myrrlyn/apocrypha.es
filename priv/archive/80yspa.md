Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

The Fall of foolish Trinimac speaks volumes,

More than an endless library of timeless tomes

In the history of weakness and ignorance;

Although the Orcs were the students and Malacath the reaping

Boethia was not the teacher that sowed the seeds of knowing.

---

The dastardly Boethia in seeing the ignorance of Trinimac

Played the fool in wearing his skin and speaking his voice

But his corrupting bile did not make Malacath:

For it was the humiliation and self-learningthat changed the Orcs.

---

It is not the teacher’s act that the lesson is taught

But the self-reflection and the self-sight

In awareness to know that a lesson is being taught

That reaps the sown seeds of knowledge to yield!
