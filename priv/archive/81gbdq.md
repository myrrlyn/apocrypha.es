Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

In war the glory of glories gained

When facing the slings and arrows of foes

Brings them begging mercy at your feet

Surrendering to delay or prevent their dismal demise.

What is the course of action for such fools or cowards?

If they worship Trinimac, kill them and purge heresy from the earth.

If their forces have shown no mercy to yours in the past, kill them.

However, if they can be used to further the strongholds' cause - keep them for
barter.

For when the battered forces are forced around the table

A few dead prisoners may prove most troublesome;

In victory - more concessions can be grafted.

In defeat - more blessed land can be saved.
