> The Thieves Guild is **not** a myth. It is understandable as to why one might

> extensive and bizarre lengths to conceal their activities and inner
> functioning from non-members. The Guild _wants_ you to believe that they are a
> fable, and their mythos is but one clandestine weapon they utilize against the
> unsuspecting masses. That is, in part, what this publication entails. My
> safety and standard of living would likely be imperiled if I were to indulge

> interests as well. This tome is not an endeavor to subvert the Guild, but
> rather, it is a publication of a certain topic that intrigues me.
>
> Lexicography and linguistics are passions of mine, and as a scholar of such

> from all over Tamriel to translate manuscript of various languages, both
> living and dead. I’ll admit that my studies have become tedious over the

> speechlore! That is the case that the Imperial Watch has presented me with.
> Here in the woefully marred Imperial City, once the Jewel of the Rumare, the
> now convalescing Imperial Watch are struggling terribly against the criminal
> underworld that has been emboldened by the chaos that the war left behind. The
> outlaws who have been preying on the wretched state of order have been nearly

> become more complex.
>
> I thought them disorganized, personally, but when an agent of the Watch
> approached me with several documents belonging to illicit smugglers and
> incarcerated master thieves, and then requested that I translate, I was taken
> aback by this new discovery. It consisted of seemingly random, nonsensical use
> of words from several dialects that appeared devoid of meaning without
> context. Even more extraordinarily, several words appear to be entirely
> original, with no other vernacular means to trace their origin. Thieves in
> this city have invented their own language!
>
> It’s what is known in linguistic circles as a _cant_ or a _cryptolect_, a

Gnashers – A term for the collective Imperial Watch; the civil authorities of
the Imperial City.

## J

Jawdack – A jeering term for an overly superstitious thief, or an avid
worshipper of Nocturnal. I believe the term to be associated directly with the
_“Jackdaw”_, a common blackbird. My reasoning is that ravens, crows, and other
such black-plumed family of icteridae birds are related to religious imagery of
Nocturnal. As the name is inverted, I imagine this insinuates that the thief in
question is _“backwards”_ in his beliefs. ex: _“He won’t do the job, says it’s
‘bad luck’. What a jawdack.”_

Jing – Stolen coins or money, in the sense that it _“jingles in your pocket”_.

Joke – A lock on a chest or a door. ex: _“We’ll need a draw-latch to tig that
joke.”_

Jukrum – Booty, bounty, stolen goods. This entry is particularly interesting, as
it appears to be a rough transliteration of an Old Cyrodillic word meaning
incandescent or shiny of the 2nd Era. How it came to common use in this age is
an enigma.

## K

Kaddey – On board, or up to a challenge. The term is derivative of a Ta’agra
term, particularly of the Pa’alatiini dialect. ex: _“You think you’re kaddey to
this, ketch?”_

Ketch – A fool, especially someone who gets themselves into trouble when they
should know better. The origin is unclear, but it appears to be a Cyrodilic
parlance of some vague Dunmeri influence (possibly Alt Redoranis?).

Kiss – A pry bar or similar lever tool. ex: _“Hand me the kiss.”_

Knock Knock – An informal greeting in place of hello.

## L

Lady – Nocturnal, aka Lady Luck. ex: _“The Lady’s kind to me tonight.”_

Laugh – The act of escaping or slipping away. ex: _“They almost snapt me, but I
gave ‘em the laugh.”_

Laughing ken – the local Guild hideout.

Lifted – To be promoted within the guild ranks. ex: _“Prince Prig just lifted
me. Guess who’s cloy-cove sharp now?”_

Lost – Dead. ex: _“He got lost.”_ Telling someone to _“get lost”_ is actually in
very poor taste.

Lurch – An undercover spy or civil guardsman.

## M

Melt down – Spend money quickly. ex: _“Let’s go melt down this jing!”_

Milk – Silver.

## N

Nap stick – A heavy stick, club or mace.

actual beggar.

Roof hoof – Can be both a verb meaning to travel by rooftop, or it can be a noun
referencing an acrobat.

Rooton’ – The act of committing crimes.

Rounder – A professional burglar.

Rust – Copper.

## S

Shadow dance – To turn invisible by use of magic spell or elixir. ex: _“I wish I
knew how to shadow dance.”_

Shadow Dancer – A thief who is particularly skilled and studied in Illusion
magic, the term referring to chameleon and invisibility spells. I interpet this
sort of individual to be uncommon and highly sought after in the Thieves Guild.
At least, one would hope so.

Shadow hide you – A kind farewell from one thief to another, wishing luck.

Shoulder tap – To stab someone in the back, figuratively or literally. ex:
_“When the ketch wanders in here with the jukrum, and tickles the bite, we’ll
shoulder tap him.”_

Show – The local market, either legitimate or illicit.

Shriv – An untrustworthy or incompetent person. This term is typically offensive
among thieves. ex: _“He tried to bilk me out of my jing! He’s a shriv.”_

Tickle – To engage, alert, or trigger something; generally a trap. ex:

## U

Uncle – Fence

## V

Visiting the neighbors – Burglary.

## W

Whoobub – To start a riot, generally as a cover for an escape or prison break.

Worms – Brains, smarts, intelligence. To say someone’s got worms is to imply
that they’re quite clever. ex: _“You’ve got quite some worms in yer head.”_

Wren – A person designated as a lookout during a heist or burglary, sometimes
equipped with a small whistle that sounds like a songbird, hence the name.

## Y

Yarp – To squeal; tattle-tale, or reveal information about a crime. ex _“That
cackler’s gonna yarp to the grashers.”_

When overheard in conversation by untrained ears, Guild Cant can be particularly
difficult to follow, much to the advantage of footpads everywhere. As an
example, consider this typical discussion between two thieves, which would
likely take place in a public place like a pub or tavern.

**EXAMPLE CONVERSATION**

Thief #1: “_Knock knock_! Me an’ “Rough-Dog” was just _flag wavin’_ to _visit
the neighbors_ in the town _show_. Silas is our _draw-latch_ and is already
_kaddey_ to it. We lookin’ fer a fourth _gentleman_ for _wren. Giddy?_”

Thief #2: “_Cut the chant and glass me_. What kind of _lukrum_ ya wanna _nim_?
How’s your _uncle?_”

Thief #1: “_Uncle’s out of town_, we’re going to pick _jing_ at _thumbs_.”

Thief #2: “In _show_? That’s _fat-lady_. Sounds too _boring_, and I ain’t your
_able_ when yer _snapt_. I’m _comfy_.”

**TRANSLATION**

Thief #1: _“Hello! “Rough-Dog” and I were planning on burglarizing shops in the
Market District. Silas can lockpick for us, and he has already agreed to it.
We’re looking for a fourth thief to act as a lookout. Interested?”_

Thief #2: _“Hold on, I want details. What kind of loot are you going to steal?
Who’s your fence?”_

Thief #1: _“We don’t need a fence. We are going for septims only, during
midnight.”_

Thief #2: _“From the market? That’s heavy work. The job sounds too risky, and I
will not be an accessory to your crime when you are apprehended. I’m not
interested.”_
