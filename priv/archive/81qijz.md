_You have come! You have come to hear the word of Almighty Talos! The glorious
truth is before you, sons and daughters of Snow, the true God of Man is come
once more!_

_At this moment, the rot spread by our Aldmeri oppressors is being purged in a
divine conflagration as the Thalmor are put to flight by the children of Mighty
Talos. Those who would blaspheme his mighty name shall soon fall before his
throne and swear fealty, else they shall wear their pride as yokes, dragging
themselves through the streets weighed down by their sins._

_The Truth is before you, children of the Dragon, the world is to be made clean
and the righteous amongst you are to sit beside Talos in the New World,
enthroned and robed in splendour with crowns of fire placed upon your brows. All
shall know the freedom of Talos, the liberation from this festering mire of
Elven corruption. Thus, the wicked elves shall be brought low and the very
mountains shall tremble at his roar. With but a simple whisper divine Talos
shall shake the very foundations of this world and even the Greybeards shall
come down from their holy mountain to sing of the death of the Old World as the
wailing of the impious is drowned out by the triumphant roars of Talos’
children. Attend me well, sons and daughters of Snow, for I, Heimskr, am the
mouth from which mighty Talos speaks, and he would have you know his divine
love!_

_I beseech thee, children of the Dragon, turn away from the false idols you have
constructed, and look upon the glory that is to come. Be not afraid of this time
of transition, for it marks the death of the elves’ tyranny and the ascension of
man to our rightful place at Talos’ side. If you be pious and have faith in
mighty Talos, you shall have nothing to fear from his children, for they destroy
only those who would spread lies about our great sovereign. So, take heed,
children of Snow, for the coming of the Dragons is a sign to all that this evil
world shall soon be cast down and from its remains, a new and better one shall
be made._

_Wayward children, repent, and you may yet escape the purge that is to come.
Repent, and you too shall sit at Talos’ side, exalted and gifted with the chance
to aid in the creation of a better world._

_So endeth the Sermon of Heimskr._
