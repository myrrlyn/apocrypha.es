\[This document appears to be a Altmeri collection of intelligence and requests
on notable criminals around the Abecean Sea. One in particular catches your
eye.\]

**Security Level**: Altaedra

**Date Submitted**: 2E 553, 16th of Sun’s Height

**Submitted by**: Sorcalin Graybinder, Firsthold Naval Intelligence

**Subject**: Casnar Leki

**Known Aliases**: The Singer of Stros M’Kai, Dread Pirate Leki

**Known Crimes**: Piracy, Destruction of Alinori property, Insurrection,
Smuggling, Mer-Trafficking

**Race**: Redguard

**Age**: 43

**Status**: Active

**Magical Proficiency**: Illusion(Presumed)

**Threat Level**: High

**Recommendation**: Termination

**Report**: _For the past 7 years, Casnar Leki has been sailing the Abecean in
his ship, “The Silver Storm”. His crew have been successful in destabilizing
Hammerfell and Cyrodiil, proliferating skooma into Rihad and engaging in the
second torching of Anvil. He has made himself into a human boogeyman, with
survivors of his attacks spreading tales of rain made of phantasmal knives,
shadowy creatures in the corners of their eyes, and sudden silence. With these
actions, we have in the past viewed him as a useful asset in our long-term
goals, feeding his crew port security information through covert operatives
along Hammerfell’s southern coast. His usefulness, however, is beginning to
wane._

_In the past year, he and his crew have decided to enter the slave trade. He has
engaged in the trafficking of Bosmer and Altmer, selling them to Redguard crown
nobles, his fellow pirates, sload, and, though we have been unable to verify
first-hand, to Maormer. Mer serving Men or being used as Sload experiments is
bad enough, but the possibility of being sold to Maormer becomes a national
security risk. If any of our agents are captured and sold to the tropical
brutes, it could trigger a chain reaction leading to Maormer storming the
capitol. For this reason, my recommendation at this time is changed to
termination. Rather than a simple assassination, however, I propose we use him
as a test run for the Dwenevir Sapphire-Fleet. While it may seem overkill,
utilizing cutting-edge Altmeri ocean-smithing against a potential Maormer
collaborator seems more than fitting. Additionally, if our fleet is in any way
damaged, the test will inform us of its practicality._
