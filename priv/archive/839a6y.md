In the beginning, twelve Worlds of Creation were born from the union of Anu and
Nir.

Of Four were the Inner Worlds, realms of everlasting Creation and Innovation.

Of Three were the Middle Worlds, places of Balance and Tranquility.

Of Five were the Outer Worlds, dimensions of Magic and Heaven.

Upon the Hunt of Blood seven Shattered, and the Tree of Life was Broken.

Sundered, they fell as shooting stars to the Middle Worlds, and brought Life to
its barren wastes.
