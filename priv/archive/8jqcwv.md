![Borgas of Winterhold][banner]

He is known by many names. The Mad Hound of Winterhold. The Bastard of Bruma.
The Great Betrayer. The Heretic and perhaps most damning: The Puppet King.

Whatever name we refer to him as, it is without question High King Borgas is
considered to be the most detested and vilified monarch in the history of
Skyrim. These are not my words, dear reader, but the words of almost each and
every Nord who has been taught of Borgas’ betrayal and deception since they were
little children. His actions are widely regarded to have led to the War of
Succession and ultimately the complete downfall of the First Empire of the
Nords.

Borgas, the last monarch of the Ysgramor Dynasty, was a king whose accession to
the throne was unlawful, whose rule of law was cruel and tyrannical, and whose
downfall was a result of his own hubris.

## Early Life

To understand Borgas we must first examine his youth. Most of what we know about
his origins was not revealed until after his death and the downfall of the
Alessian Empire — primarily from his own secret journals. On further research of
these texts, one can understand why he sought to keep much of his early life
obscured.

Borgas was indeed a distant descendant of Ysgramor through the royal [House of
Hjornskar][0], this much is at least true. His father was the infamous Thane
Yngnavar Ghost-Bear, the Butcher of Sancre Tor. When Yngnavar sacked the holy
city of Sancre Tor in an attempt to break the alliance between Skyrim and
Cyrodiil, High Queen Yrsa had him executed and his royal house dishonored.
However, some months prior to his death, Yngnavar is believed to have
impregnated a Nedic tavern girl while stationed in Bruma.

While it has often been said Borgas hailed from Winterhold (as one of his many
names claim) in truth he grew up in the slums of Bruma — deeply frustrated with
the knowledge that he was of noble blood but disgraced and forever shunned in
the north for the sins of his father. When he was old enough, a Colovian lord
named Ami-El took Borgas under his wing and educated him in the art of war and
politics. Borgas became skilled in his own right, eventually becoming Ami-El’s
right hand.

## The Monkey Prophet

Around 1E 312, an Imgan mystic named Marukh fled from persecution in his
homeland of Valenwood and was granted refuge in Colovia. His beliefs and
teachings questioned Elven rule and later called for a suppression of Elven
elements within Alessia’s pantheon of Eight Divines. These teachings gained
popularity among the Colovian populace, particularly Nedic xenophobes who felt
hatred against the Ayleids and were angered by Emperor Belharza’s ruling to
allow the continued existence of Ayleid vassal-states.

Eventually, an order known initially as the Holy Brothers of Marukh was
established and grew rapidly. Its popularity among the Nedes caught the
attention of Lord Ami-El who subsequently began to endorse Marukh and grant him
protection. Over the next twenty years, the Order grew from strength to strength
and its teachings became widespread. Lord Ami-El’s power and influence also grew
in this time and he saw this as an opportunity to challenge the Ruby Throne.

According to his fragmented journals, Ami-El was well aware of Borgas’ ancestry
and the potential royal blood held. Many scholars argue it was the sole reason
he uplifted Borgas from a life of poverty and dishonor. To own a king the north
whose allegiance was Colovian would have been most beneficial to the Nedic lord,
and so he bided his time for the perfect moment. Borgas had his own motivations
for working with (or rather for) Lord Ami-El. He long sought the restoration of
his dishonored House and to take his rightful place among his kinsmen in the
north by any means necessary.

As fate had it, Ami-El didn’t need to wait for very long. In 1E 332, Ami-El’s
spies reported that Emperor Belharza had requested High Queen Yrsa of Skyrim
visit the capital and join him in an urgent conclave. Queen Ysra and her most
loyal jarls arrived in the Imperial City some weeks later, giving Ami-El his
opportunity.

## The Prophesied Usurper

Much of what occurred next was kept completely hidden from the official Alessian
histories for centuries. Only once their Empire had fallen in the late First Era
did ancient sealed manuscripts, discovered in the lost archives of the [Canulus
Monastery][1], come to light and reveal the truth to the greater fellowship of
historians.

On the third day of Belharza’s conclave, Borgas led a small band of Alessian
legionaries to the [Dragonfire Cathedral][2] where a private assembly was taking
place. The legionaries were [ordered to murder both Belharza and High Queen
Yrsa][3], but to spare the life of her jarls. Once their unlawful slaughter was
complete, Borgas personally escorted the surviving jarls away from the cathedral
and towards the city gates.

With both the Nordic and Alessian empires were now without rulers, Lord Ami-El
quickly consolidated his power by eradicating Belharza’s remaining supporters
and heirs and crowned himself Emperor of Cyrod shortly after. Borgas, however,
decided to escort Yrsa’s jarls safely home to Skyrim with his brigand army. What
exactly occurred between Borgas and the jarls on their journey back to Skyrim
has plagued historians for centuries, for neither the journals of either Borgas
or Ami-El reveal any further details. What we can be sure of is a grand
deception was masterfully orchestrated.

The official histories of the time (now widely discredited after the discovery
of the Canulus Monastery archives) claim Borgas heroically rescued the jarls
from the slaughter, and this selfless act of valor is what restored his House’s
honor. A moot was called immediately upon their arrival in Winterhold and the
surviving jarls unanimously crowned him High King of Skyrim.

Were the jarls complicit in Borgas’ plot? Were they threatened with the same
fate as their high queen if they didn’t bend the knee? Some historians, such as
the Pluribel of Dusk, go as far as suggesting Ayleid magicks turned them into
obedient thralls. Truly we may never know.

## The Iron Fist

Borgas’ coronation took place in Winterhold and was attended by numerous
dignitaries and envoys seeking favor with the new High King. His first act as
king was to declare the renewal of his kingdom’s alliance with the Alessian
Empire and the newly crowned Emperor Ami-El. This was a deliberate act to
essentially announce that the death of Queen Yrsa would not be avenged.
Regardless, House Asbjorn sought retribution for the murder of their matriarch
but their pleas fell on deaf ears.

The autonomy that each Hold was granted for centuries was tightened as Borgas
began to institute sweeping changes to the empire. One of the most controversial
decrees was the abolishment of each and every independent city watch regiment.
For centuries, each Jarl paid for their own regiment of guards to protect their
Hold — and as such their guardsmen pledged undying fealty to their jarl. The
Solitude Wardens, Falkreath Rangers, Watchdogs of Riften and many more had
existed for centuries and were institutions in their own right. King Borgas
drastically altered this dynamic by disbanding these regiment and installing his
own brigand army, the Black Watch, thus shifting the power and influence his
jarls held over to the crown. How Borgas managed to gain such loyalty and
execute such a change is remarkable, but one of the most common theories state
he was in a position to promise an entire hectare of land to each of his 10,000
guardsmen upon retirement. Over the course of three years, Borgas replaced every
city guard regiment with the Black Watch, however, allowed established veteran
guardsmen the opportunity to keep their posts if they pledged their swords to
the Black Watch. This provision was crucial as it likely avoided potentially
disgruntled guardsmen rebelling.

On the eve of 1E 339 King Borgas infamously decreed that Frostcrag Hold in its
entirety would be relinquished to the Alessian Empire. An unprecedented move
given the Hold (which stretched across much of north-west Cyrodiil) held great
strategic importance to Skyrim, and Bruma was considered to be a prosperous
trading hub. Given what we know today about Borgas’ shadowy relationship with
Emperor Ami-El, some scholars claim this decree was issued not from Winterhold
but from the Imperial City.

In 1E 358 Borgas’ grip on his vast empire began to falter when Clan Direnni of
Balfiera rose to prominence and began taking back their lands in High Rock.
Indeed, many historians have linked the rise of the Direnni Hegemony with the
mass exodus of Ayleids from Cyrodiil following the Alessian Slave Rebellion.
Unable to dedicate troops to High Rock, Borgas accepted aid from Emperor Ami-El.
Despite the additional troops at his disposal, Borgas lost more and more of
Greater Bretony to [Lord Viridian Direnni][4] as the months passed.

## The Heretical King

In 1E 362, a fundamental change in the very fabric of Nordic culture was enacted
— the deceitful outlawing of the Nordic Pantheon. Scholars remain unsure if the
intention to outlaw the Nordic Pantheon came from Borgas’ benefactors in the
south or from Borgas himself, but it’s no coincidence that the change coincided
with the brutal enforcement of the Alessian Doctrines in Cyrodiil. Once more we
look to the secret diaries of Borgas which reveal how this came to pass and
where the official Nordic histories fail.

Borgas, by all accounts, wasn’t particularly religious and supposedly forsook
both Nordic and Cyrodilic gods during his early years — possibly due to his
difficult life as a child in Bruma or a lack of religious guidance growing up.
When Lord Ami-El became guardian to Prophet Marukh, Borgas became more and more
acquainted with the seer, and his teachings deeply resonated with him. It wasn’t
long before Borgas became an ardent faithful in the Holy Brothers of Marukh,
later known as the Alessian Order. Although his devotion to Marukh was
unquestionable, when he became High King he was forced to hide his true faith
from the masses, at least initially.

Thirty years of rule passed and Borgas had slowly but surely manipulated
numerous aspects of the empire to bolster his position and authority. His loyal
brigand army gave him complete control over his jarls and their subjects, his
network of spies was spread throughout the empire and all almost all of his
enemies were either dead or exiled. Even the royal houses of Asbjorn and Fjora
were cowed into submission when he secretly ordered the assassination of both of
their patriarchs in 1E 351. Securing an audience with the High King became near
impossible and according to some legends, his personal bodyguard was a ferocious
Wrothgarian giant who guarded him at all times.

## Second Council of the Hawk

In 1E 362 Borgas announced a great religious conclave would gather at Kyne’s
Aerie. Under the guise of discussing potential religious reforms (put forth by
the [High Eyas][5] herself) the entire Sisterhood of the Hawk was ordered to
attend the Second Council of the Hawk.

The first council, convened under King Vundheim, took place over 150 years
earlier and was considered a great success. And so in the same year some eight
hundred sisters, abesses, priors, and voice-monks traveled to Kyne’s Aerie — a
vast monastery near the summit of the Throat of the World which served as the
epicenter of the old Nordic faith. In one felled swoop Borgas exterminated the
entire order when an enormous explosion of arcane energy vaporized the Aerie.

The aftermath all across the empire was chaotic, and with no witnesses to speak
of speculation of what occurred was rife. While many suspected the High King’s
involvement, those who dared to make such a claim were thrown into the dungeons.
Others blamed the “[Old Grey Dragon][6]” (turn-of-the-era folklore that spoke of
an ancient Dragon rumored to roost somewhere on the mountain), Snow Elf magic,
or numerous other suspects. Curiously, the official histories promulgated by the
throne declared that the disaster at the Aerie was proof that the old gods had
forsaken them, and that the truth was with the One true God. A copy of the royal
announcement follows:

> An announcement from High King Borgas of Winterhold to his loyal subjects, 1E
> 362
>
> O Noble Nords, you will know of the catastrophe that struck the Holy Aerie in
> weeks passed. Know that the fate of the devoted Sisterhood deeply troubles me
> and torments my very soul. Were my attendance at the Holy Aerie not have

>
> My dear subjects, these tragic turn of events hath led me to reflect and
> reexamine our own so-called gods. Truly, it has become clear to me that our
> exalted and brave ancestors, who deserted the cruel Elder Wood, regrettably
> brought with them false idols from their primitive home. Shor and Kyne and

>

While many Nords were no doubt highly suspicious of this foreign religion, they
had no choice to comply. With the Sisterhood eliminated, the divine soul of the
empire was torn out and left much of the citizenry spiritually lost. The Black
Watch dealt with rebellion severely and it wasn’t long before the dogmatic
priesthood of the Alessian Order became firmly established in Skyrim.

Truly this has gone down as of the great historical ironies. Old King Valdimar
eradicated the cruel dragon priesthood to free his people, only for his
descendant to willingly institute a fanatical priesthood that later enslaved his
people.

## The Valenwood Misadventure

As Marukh’s teachings became enshrined across Cyrodiil, hostility grew between
the Camoran Dynasty of Valenwood and the Alessian Empire. Borgas saw this
tension as an opportunity to wage war upon the Wood Elves, and began plotting
alongside Emperor Ami-El. Their plan was to declare an armistice and lure King
Gwilgoth Camoran and his ruling nobles to a peace summit at the ancient city of
Arenthia, which at the time was considered disputed territory. Borgas and Ami-El
planned to have the Camoran nobles executed during their meeting with them. With
the leadership of the Camoran dynasty dead, they would have immediately invaded
Valenwood. Whether the Wood Elves were aware of Borgas’ reputation for betrayal
or came to the meeting with prior knowledge of their scheme is unknown, but
regardless their plan utterly backfired.

Both the Silvenar and the Green Lady attended the meeting in King Gwilgoth’s
stead, alongside their Jaqspur honor guard. According to legend, just as Borgas’
men were about to strike, the Silvenar invoked the infamous Wild Hunt and the
entire Bosmeri party began to shapeshift into a horde of feral, bloodthirsty,
supernatural beasts. An eye-witness account from a retired Alessian legate
follows:

> Those elves were truly accursed. I swear by the Holy Primate… Such horror my
> eyes had never beheld, for I saw them howl in pain as bones and antlers and
> tentacles burst out from within them like an Abacean pufferfish of unspeakable
> repugnance. The entire pack then burst into a plume of crimson smoke and the
> stench of burning flesh filled the air. From within the thick cloud, a twisted
> visage of the Green Witch stared deep into my eyes and I knew that I would
> never be free of the pervasive terror that it had struck into my soul.
>
> By the grace of the One, I rushed our blessed emperor to safety and we escaped
> the slaughter. The enraged northern king tried to cleave through the
> abomination with his greataxe, but it was for naught. The monstrosity poured
> down into his throat and I watched as it violently choked the life out from
> him.

Eric of Guis wrote that Borgas was killed for the “iniquities” of his Alessian
faith, while Phrastus of Elinhir frequently described his fate as the truest
form of poetic justice. Given the High King’s sordid history, one can only agree
with these esteemed scholars.

## War of the Houses

Following the death of King Borgas, his body was secretly returned to Skyrim and
interred in a hidden tomb by his faithful honor guard. According to legend, they
deemed that any successor to their liege would be unworthy to don the Jagged
Crown, and thus it was buried with him. And for centuries the tomb of Borgas
remained lost to history.

The Moot was called in Winterhold immediately after and the jarls from each Hold
petitioned for a new High King. The court of King Borgas demanded the throne
should remain within House Hjornskar and fall to Skerd-Queen Hera. [Jarl
Hanse][8] of House Fjora was a descendant of [Vrage the Butcher][9] and was
favored by the citizenry as the most capable while the jarls loyal to House
Asbjorn petitioned for Jarl Vokiir of Solitude.

When it became clear Skerd-Queen Hera was attempting to take the throne by
force, the three royal Houses of the Skerd declared war upon each other. Each
House quickly raised their own armies and fortified their holdings. The lesser
clans of Skyrim were forced to choose their allegiance and pledge their swords
or be wiped out in the bloodshed that would soon follow.

And so the fateful War of Succession began and plunged Skyrim into a long and
bitter civil war that would last decades. The Houses of the Skerd would never
recover from the conflict, and ultimately it spelled the end of the
500-year-old, once-proud and fearsome dynasty of Ysgramor the Returned.
