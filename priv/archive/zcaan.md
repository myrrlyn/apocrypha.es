  This was going to be a whole treatise on the languages of Tamriel but after
  reviewing it I realised that it had no real substance. There wasn’t any real
  meat behind it and it was basically a compilation of simple and obvious
  points. So instead of boring you I’ve decided to replace it for an assortment
  of my favourite and (hopefully) most interesting observations.

## Falmer Language

When comparing Falmeris to Ayleidoon one can see many similarities. Words such
as “ye” (and), “buro(i)” (slaves), “gandra” (gifts) and many more share the same
meaning in both Falmeris and Ayleidoon. This can also be seen in the names of
Falmer and Ayleids:

Ayleid — Umaril, Celethelel, Tjurhane

Falmer — Gelebor, Celegriath, Vyrthur

Therefore if the language is similar we can go further and attest that their
culture and origins are similar. If so then I’d go and say that the Falmer are
actually the Northern subgroup of the larger Ayleid culture. From this we can
extract that the Falmer had a similar if not exact replica of the Ayleid
pantheon with the same amount of reverence for Magnus, Auri-el and Aetherius.
Whether this reverence continued on to Meridia and other Daedra or whether or
not the Falmer shared the same passion for torture and enslavery, I am not sure.

## Dwemer Language

Dwemeris is the most alien of the languages of Tamriel. Its spellings and its
names are different to any other language of Tamriel and its connection to
Aldmeris is faint. Names such as Kagrenac, Dumac and Nchunak are for more harsh
than the average soft Mer name and placenames such as far more so. Each Dwemer
stronghold or city seems to share a part of their name with another which hints
at a common name or word between strongholds. Examples of this include the
stronghold of Mzuleft in Vvardenfell and Mzulft in Skyrim and the city of
Arkngthand in Morrowind and Arkngthamz in Skyrim.

The reason for such a language is unknown but I conclude in saying that the
language was a construct of the Dwemer just like everything else in their
society. The Dwemer probably found a problem with Aldmeris and so built a new
and better one just like they did with their animinculi.

## Tamrielic Language Tree

[Here][0] is a language tree that I created in order to show the connections
between all the various languages of Tamriel. Unfortunately I could not find a
way to place Ta’Agra or Yoku within the tree but to all those wondering they
come under Ehlnofex, both individually.
