Hello everyone! I’ve been asked to post on the reddit the work I am doing on the
Jel language, and I must say I’m flattered by the interest this little project
of mine is getting. So, here goes:

**Jel** is the language spoken in Black Marsh by the native Argonian race. It is
famous in all of Tamriel for its complicated grammar and hellish pronounciation,
which make it very difficult for humans and mer to pronounce correctly. Jel has
no plurals and no tense.

## Pronounciation

The Jel alphabet goes:

**a, ch, d, e, g, h, i, j, jh, k, l, lh, ny, n, o, q, r, s, t, th, ts, u, w,**
**x, y, p**

Jel has no *labial* consonants, i.e. consonants that are pronounced with the
help of the lips, since Argonians don’t have any.

- **a** is pronounced like in English *father*.
- **ch** sounds like a *ky* pronounced very fast, somewhat like in *backyard*.
- **d** is like in English *dog*.
- **e** is pronounced roughly like the *ay* in *say* when stressed, laxer when
  unstressed.
- **g** is like in English *go*.
- **h** is like in English but voiced.
- **i** is like the *ee* in English *free*, but laxer when unstressed.
- **j** is pronounced *dz*.
- **jh** is pronounced like a very fast *gy*; it’s the voiced counterpart to
  *ch*.
- **k** is like in English *Kate*.
- **l** is like in English *lake*, never as in *dull*.
- **lh** is really difficult. It’s a voiced Welsh *ll* as in *Llanelli*. Put
  your tongue in the position for *l*, and then blow.
- **ny** is somewhat like in *canyon*.
- **n** is like in English *nine*.
- **o** is like in English *so*, but unrounded (the lips don’t “bunch” when
  pronouncing it).
- **q** is another difficult sound, namely a voiced German *ch* as in *ich*.
- **r** is a tap, like in English with a Scottish accent.
- **s** is like the *z* in English *zoo*.
- **t** is like in English *too*.
- **th** is always like in English *there*, except before unvoiced consonants,
  when it becomes as in *bath*.
- **ts** is pronounced like in English *guts*.
- **u** is like the *oo* in English *moon*, but unrounded, like in Japanese.
- **w** is like in English *well*, but unrounded.
- **x** is a voiced German *ch* as in *Bach*.
- **y** is like in English *yell*.

The last consonant appears as **p** only at the end of a word, but is present at
the beginning of every syllable that begins with a vowel. It is a glottal stop,
i.e. the sound between the sillables in English *oh-oh* or the apostrophe in
Hawaiian *Hawai’i*. The stress always falls on syllables containing a long
vowel, a diphthong or ending with a click. Otherwise it falls on the
penultimate. There are also two sounds which are very alien to an English
speaker, which are the **clicks**. In Argonian, they are **c’**, pronounced like
in English *tsk tsk*, and **xh** which is a loud click of the tongue.

## Pronouns

Jel has two sets of pronouns: the “connected” set, used to refer to all
individuals connected through the Hist, i.e. all Argonians, and a “disconnected”
set, used for everything else. The Argonians make no distinction in number, so
understanding whether a given pronoun refers to a single individual or to a
group of people is entirely a matter of context.

## Connected**

1st person: **sep**

2nd person: **xho**

3rd person: **suu**

4th person: **c’a**

The 4th person is a special pronoun which we could call a “hyper-inclusive we”,
which is used to refer to every being connected through the Hist at the same
time, and is therefore the only pronoun which carries some sense of plurality,
although this is misleading, since the Argonians perceive themselves as one when
they’re connected. Depending on context, it can be translated as “the whole
world” or “the Argonian people” or other such expressions.

## Disconnected

1st person: **see**

2nd person: **to**

3rd person: **thuu**

The “disconnected” set is a later derivation of the “connected” set, created
when the Argonians were forcibly taken out of their millennia-long isolation by
the Alessian Empire in the First Era, is used to refer to all non-Argonians,
which Argonians perceive as being “disconnected” in some way. This is a very
discomforting feeling to Argonians, which need to get used to it before
interacting with other peoples on a long-term basis. There is no “collective”
4th person.

## Use of the Pronouns

All Argonians refer to themselves and their peers with the “connected” set of
pronouns, although in special circumstances, such as when speaking with a
tribe-leader or a very important individual, an Argonian may refer to himself
with the “disconnected” 1st person pronoun, to suggest humility, implying that
he’s not worthy of being connected through the same Hist as whatever person he’s
talking to. To address an Argonian with the “disconnected” 2nd person pronoun is
in an of itself a powerful insult, and it’s not that rare to hear enemy tribes
refer to each other as thuu rather than suu. Conversely, every non-Argonian must
refer to himself and to his peers with the “disconnected” set of pronouns. To do
differently would be seen as unbelievably arrogant and insulting. Argonians may
refer to non-Argonians with the “connected” set of pronouns when these strangers
have done them a great favour or when they consider them close friends (e.g.
Mere-Glim probably addressed Annaïg with *xho*).

## Syntax

Unmarked word order is **OSV** (Object-Subject-Verb), when the subject of the
verb is a pronoun, however, it becomes OVS.

And, last but not least,

## Some Important Suffixes

### The Possessive Suffix

Jel marks the possessed noun, not the possessor. The suffix used is **-uth** if
the noun ends in a consonant, and **-huth** if it ends in a vowel.

### The Ablative Suffix

The suffix **-duj** means *from, originating from*.

### The Purposive Suffix

The suffix **-to** means *(in order) to*.

### The Derisive Suffix

The suffix **-luu** indicates amusement or mocking intent.

### The Locative Suffix

The suffix **-daa** means *in, inside*.

This is about it for the grammar at the moment. Here’s the sample sentences I’ve
made:

**Suur Haj-Ei golt. **

*Hist.Sap Haj-Ei drink*

Haj-Ei drinks Hist-Sap

**Suur golt-suu.**

*Hist.Sap drink-he/she*

He/she drinks Hist-Sap.

**Hajhiit maagaruth goc’daa gooluu.**

*Khajiit cart-POS mud-LOC get.stuck-DER*

The Khajiit’s cart got stuck in the mud.

**Thuu chakkuth lod Hajhiit c’oo? Hajhiit gortsuquth gorihuth thuu gooluthduj**
**thdeitoluu!**

*they butt-POS lick Khajiit why? Khajiit cuisine-POS flavour-POS they*
*mouth-POS-ABL chase.away-PUR-DER*

Why do Khajiit lick their butts? To get the taste of their cooking out of their
mouths! (The famous “Khajiit joke”)

UPDATE:

## The Jel Verb

The Jel verb has no tense and doesn’t distinguish between persons, but it does
distinguish three aspects, five moods, two voices and three cathegories of
evidentials. There are also suffixes which I call “emotionals”, which specify
how the speaker feels about the utterance, and various other suffixes.

## Aspect

There are three aspects: the **perfective**, the **imperfective** and the
**punctual**.

The **punctual** aspect is unmarked, and indicates an action performed once,
without any indication as to whether it’s been finished or it’s still in
progress.

**Gor Annaig tsuq.**

Annaïg cooks./Annaïg cooked./Annaïg will cook.

The **imperfective** mood is marked by the suffix **-re**, and indicates an
action which is incomplete, either because it’s still in progress or because it
was never finished.

**Gor Annaig tsuqre.**

Annaïg is cooking./Annaïg cooked (but didn’t finish)

The **perfective** mood is marked by the suffix **-loj**, and indicates an
action which has been completed.

**Gor Annaig tsuqloj.**

Annaïg has cooked.

## Mood

There are five moods: the **indicative**, the **irrealis**, the **imperative**,
the **purposive** and the **optative**.

The **indicative** is unmarked and indicates that the sentence is a factual
statement, without personal bias.

**Gor Annaig tsuq.**

Annaïg cooks.

The **irrealis** is marked by the suffix **-uxh**, and indicates that the
sentence is not actually all that factual. It is used in “if-clauses” and is
required by some evidentials.

**Gor Annaig tsuquxh.**

Annaïg may be cooking.

The **imperative** mood is marked by the suffix **-lop**, and sometimes by the
particle **c’ee**, which is placed at the beginning of a sentence. It is used
for commands.

**C’ee gor tsuqlop!**

Cook!

The **purposive** is marked by the suffix **-to**, and indicates purpose (“in
order to…”).

**Gor Annaig tsuqto, gorjhig rogitee-xho.**

In order for Annaïg to cook, you must bring over the pot.

The **optative** is marked by the suffix **-thelh**, and indicates desire.

**Gor Annaig tsuqthelh!**

How I wish Annaïg would cook!

Ok that’s it for now, stay tuned for more!
