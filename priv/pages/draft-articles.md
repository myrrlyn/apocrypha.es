These articles have been scraped directly from reddit, but have not yet been
processed to have the metadata and formatting that this site expects. They are
viewable, but their markup may be strange and the site does not know anything
about them other than what the scraper provided.

See the [home-page][0] for information about how to help process these and move
them over to the [accepted listing][1].
