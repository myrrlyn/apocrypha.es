title: Major Series
---

These are all of the long-form series contained in the collection. Most of these
are intended to be read as a single work that happened to be broken into
multiple posts due to reddit’s size restrictions, the author’s time constraints,
or aesthetics. However, some, such as the “Bedtime Stories” collection, are
collaborative riffs on a theme by multiple authors acting independently.
