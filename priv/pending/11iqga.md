My friends I believe I have either stumbled upon the grand conspiracy that Nu-Hatta spoke of in the Intercept, or I have taken my final steps into Sheogorath's realm. I will let you decide which.

[Conjecture](/g "In the main games the various aspects of the Time God have been attempting to undue what the Selectives did when they danced on the tower.")

**Red Mountain and Azura.**

The destruction of the Numidium marks the start of the conspiracy, it showed that Towers can be deactivated and Mundus unbound. After the Warp in the West it was fair game for the various aspects to  destroy the Towers and unbind the dragon, hopefully becoming whole again.

Now as we all know the Nerevarine was sent by Azura to remove the Tribunal's divinity and thus obtain her revenge on them, and this of course required the unbinding of the Heart and the deactivation of Red Tower, it all seems very straight forward on the surface. But lets look a little bit more in depth at the Mistress of Dusk and Dawn. Azura as we have seen in Skyrim gives her followers visions of the future, and her sphere relates to the passing of Time. Because of this I believe Azura to be one of the many Time God aspects (I stopped counting how many there were a long time ago)

Azura, being an aspect of the Time God, must have known that in order to remove the Tribunal's divinity the Nerevarine must deactivate Red Tower, As Divayth Fyr said “Azura, he said, knew and understood all things, and declined to speak of these things, or only spoke in riddles.” I suggest that this was absolutely no problem to her, as she wished to be reunited with her mirror-twins, she killed two birds with one stone, both the deactivation of Red Tower and the end of the Tribunal.

**The Oblivion Crisis.**

This is where the conspiracy gets really good. I should have just titled this part “Hermaeus Mora is a glorious bastard.”

So again as we all know the Oblivion Crisis happened when the Mythic Dawn assassinated Emperor Uriel Septim VII and his Heirs, which ended with the end of the Septim bloodline and the deactivation of White-Gold. This plan was put into place by Mankar Camoran, after reading the Mysterium Xarxes, a book written by Dagon himself.

Lets see what some experts on Daedra have to say about Dagon.

From [Varieties of Daedra](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/varieties-daedra) we have a quote from Divayth Fyr himself.

&gt; Mehrunes Dagon, on the other hand, out of pride, fixity of purpose, and a predictable lack of subtlety in thought, knew nothing and understood nothing, and was inclined to speak freely and without falsehood. 

And from [Interview with two denizens of the Shivering Isles](http://www.imperial-library.info/node/2234) we have this quote from Haskill.

&gt; Or with Mehrunes Dagon. Do not speak his name to me again. The Master of Scum. The pawn of every Prince of true power, the dupe of every schemer in the Nineteen Voids. 

According to these two reputable sources, Dagon is not a man with a plan, he's just a dog on a chain barking at cars, he needs someone to unleash him, and that somebody was Hermaeus Mora. 

Note the name of the holy book of the Mythic Dawn, the Mysterium Xarxes. Xarxes, god of secret knowledge was a scribe to Auri-El and thus servant to Mora. It was Xarxes who gave Dagon the knowledge in the Mysterium Xarxes, and it was Mora who gave the knowledge to Xarxes. And as we have seen in Skyrim he has no problem giving people false info if it means furthering his goals.

Mora, being the Daedra of fate, knew exactly what would happen if he gave that knowledge to Dagon, because in his own words “Past, Present, and Future are all as one to me.”

So now we have a full third of the known towers deactivated in a short period of time by aspects of the Time God. That brings us to the modern age.

**Post Crisis**

Almost immediately after the Crisis the Mane of Elseweyr was assassinated,  if my suspicions of the Thalmor's involvement in the deactivation of Falinesti and the assassination of the Mane that would be two towers deactivated by the Thalmor, who as the ruling kings of Alinor serve Auri-El, and work to unbind him and the entirety of Mundus. This brings the total of confirmed deactivated towers to 6, with 3 confirmed being deactivated by Aspects of the Time god and 2 suspected. The only aspect that has shown an interest in prolonging Mundus and the Kalpa is Akatosh, we see this in the Monomyth, specifically Shezzar's Song, where the pro-mundus Aedra are led by Akatosh, while the anti-mundus Aedra are led by Auri-El.

That brings us to Skyrim, which is a giant mess of Time God aspects and politics. The Dovahkiin in Skyrim has been charged with defending Snow-Throat against the Thalmor and to eliminate a major threat to the people of Mundus, namely Alduin. (Alduin is like Akatosh, neither want to see Mundus unbound, Aka because he loves this Kalpa and Alduin because he wishes to rule it.) And then of course in Dawnguard you can choose to hinder the influence of Auri-El with the blood cursed arrows. So far I have seen no good evidence to suggest that Snow-Throat has been deactivated, so I presume that it is still active. This leaves three towers still active.

Snow-Throat.

Adamantine.

Orichalc.

Before anyone murders me about including Orichalc I would ask you read these lines from Lord Vivec's Sword Meeting With Cyrus the Restless.

&gt; True stories had come that Yokus still lived among the stark remains; that some did not or could not flee when cataclysm came; others that the orichalc isles were a place of censure handed down from the no-totambu. And everyone knew the self-exiled ansu still lived there who did not witness the ho no shira, or the capture of Volen, or the Make Way of Diagna, and so were left to the sword-singing of their histories behind the Curtain of Run. 

The Islands that remain of Yokuda are called the Orichalc Isles, which is why I believe that Orichalc tower is still active.
