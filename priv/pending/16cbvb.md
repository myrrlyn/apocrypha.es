And here's part two.  If you're going to comment on these articles, I suggest you do so here, in the second half.

**18: The Egg, or Six Times the Wise**

And now we are at possibly the most contentious of the numbers.  The problem is that this Sermon appears to directly deal with Vivec, in the most deceptively obvious of ways.  And since Vivec was born an Egg, and describes himself as "Six Times the Wise," it's easy to assume that 18 is Vivec's number and nothing more.

However, as we will soon discover, there is evidence that 18 represents far more than just Vivec.  Which works out, actually, because Vivec is far more than Vivec.  It's easy to prove.  I can do it with a pocket calculator.

In numerology, the way you put numbers together means something.  2 + 9 is not the same thing as 2 and 9.  We're given 29 as the first number because all the numbers collectively are products of the math you can perform with 2 and 9.  Which thematically makes sense; 2 (divinity) and 9 (mortality) are two very disparate concepts; what else should we do with two opposites but smack them together and see what spits out?  Let's do this thing backwards.

**9 * 2 = 18**

Mortality multiplied by Divinity.  This is actually an excellent description of Vivec.  But it could also describe the Amaranth, a mortal who becomes empowered with the divine.

From another angle, [thanks to Toesock](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1422049-hunt-the-amaranth-iv/page__view__findpost__p__21772130), we can get to 18 with 3 * 6, which is the Six Walking Ways times The Invisible Gate, ALMSIVI.  This is a reference to both reaching Heaven by Violence and the Secret Gate at the center of the heart of the Second Serpent, as described in [Sermon 21](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-twenty-one).

Either way, we are looking at an entity of incredible divine power.  Either a divine mortal, or a being with the knowledge of all six Walking Ways and the Secret Gate.

**9 + 2 = 11**

A mortal added to divinity.  A Master, as described in the Lessons, is one who has incredible knowledge, and it's not hard to guess that anyone who has walked any of the Six Walking Ways could be considered a Master.  If nothing else, there are a minimum of three Masters in the Lessons (Nerevar, Vivec, and the Void Ghost) and possibly more (Ysmir, Sheogorath, Dagoth Ur, need I go on?)

A Master will be the next Ruling King, but whether that King has come as the Nerevarine or not is a matter for debate.

**9 - 2 = 7**

Mortality minus Divinity?  Doesn't make much sense that way, or the other, as 2 - 9.  But if you interpret 9 as "The Missing," a void, it starts to work.  Removing a void from the Enantiomorph requires a Sword at its Center.

**2 and 9 = 29**

And here we are, back at the beginning.  Divinity, an Enantiomorph (2), next to a Void (9).  The Captive Sage is Mortality and Divinity at once, a flawed perfection, destined to destroy itself.  It is mortality acting as a divine entity, which means it is a mortal who does what the divine does: create without constraint.  But it is also an Enantiomorph in itself: the combination of Void and Divinity.  The limit of the Sage's ability is determined only by the manner in which it was created.

Without question, the Hidden Amaranth, and possibly all Amaranths, are Captive Sages.  Dreamers, trapped in a void, alone, with nothing but themselves for company.

So here we are at the most important point, the crux of my argument.  The Captive Sage is an Amaranth.  Why?  Because he is wise, as a Sage, so he has knowledge like that of a Master.  But he is also truly alone, being Captive, and from this desire for companionship, for Love, he creates from within himself.  The Sage starts to dream, and that dream becomes as real as that Sage can make it.

If a Captive Sage has the knowledge of a Master, of a Ruling King, that dream can be incredible.  Dagoth Ur was a Master, a Captive Sage, a witness to the Foul Murder of Nerevar and the joining of ALMSIVI with the Heart of Lorkhan, wounded and trapped beneath Red Mountain the Heart spoke to him, and gave him terrible knowledge, and in his solitude he began to imagine a dream of Ash and Terror.  He Loved his dream, however, and even though his divinity was foul and twisted his Love was real enough.

But what if a Captive Sage came to his divinity by the way of CHIM?  What if he was a dreamer within a dream, and somehow escaped into the Void at the center of the Second Serpent, behind the Hidden Gate?  Trapped there, deprived of senses, in the black prison he entered of his own free will, he will begin to dream so his Love can keep him company.  This is why the Amaranth is described as being in Love.  Let's take a bit from the [Loveletter](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/loveletter-fifth-era-true-purpose-tamriel):

&gt;God outside of all else but his own free consciousness, hallucinating for eternity and falling into love: I AM AND I ARE ALL WE.
C0DA Digitals have confirmed that a subject in sensory deprivation begins to hallucinate after only twenty minutes. Scale unto this along the magical spectrum and maintenance of time, which is forever, and you begin to see the Lunar God’s failure as Greatest Gift. As above, “This is the love of God.”

&gt;Why Love?

&gt;Know Love to avoid the Landfall, my brothers and sisters of the past.

&gt;The New Man becomes God becomes Amaranth, everlasting hypnogogic. Hallucinations become lucid under His eye and therefore, like all parents of their children, the Amaranth cherishes and adores all that is come from Him.

Come to the House of We.  When the Amaranth becomes, the occupants of Mundus will have him as an escape route, and they will flee through the center of the Wheel and into One World In Spirit I Am.

In closing, a footnote before I begin writing the next section (which, again, will take some time): Numerology in the Sermons works with other numbers as well. In the most basic example:

1: The Tower. Also the number of Nerevar, and the Sharmat.

1 and 1 together: 11, the Number of the Master. Vivec asks: "Could you ever tell if they switched places?" They are identical, because they are mirror-images, a repeating symbolic comparison that reoccurs constantly in Kirkbride's metaphysics system. They are identical to all but the most wise. If the two worked together, imagine what they could achieve?

1 + 1 = 2. The Enantiomorph. Nerevar plus his opposite, the Sharmat. The echo of Anu &amp; Padomay.

1 + -1 = 0. Zero Sum. The Tower plus its negation, or the Tower minus itself. This is how you zero-sum, if you ain't got the chops, so to speak.
