Okay, so it's been a while since I last posted something constructive.  I apologize for that, but Memospore has occupied a lot of my time lately.  With the recent dip in activity, I've been able to finish a project of mine, inspired by a conversation with Toesock, Neradac and Umpteen on IRC.

Many people feel a connection between Sermons 12 through 14, which outline the event known as the "**Pomegranate Banquet**," and CHIM.  Partially this is because Sermon 12 is the first mention of the word "CHIM," but there seems to be a stronger connection there, a metaphysical subtext that is not immediately obvious.

Later in the 36 Lessons, in Sermon 31, Vivec writes: "[…] he recalled the Pomegranate Banquet, where he was forced to marry to Molag Bal with wet scriptures to cement his likeness as Mephala and write with black hands."

Why was lying with Molag Bal a **requirement** to becoming the anticipation of Mephala?

There may be a thematic equivalency.  For example, if we consider [the figure inscribed on the Dark Brotherhood's door in Oblivion](http://images.uesp.net/9/93/OB-place-Sanctuary_Door.jpg) to be depicting Mephala, as is often suggested, it's possible that she is in the process of killing her children, much as Vivec does after the Banquet.  And sure, Mephala is the Daedric Prince of Sex and Murder, and that does sum up the Banquet quite well.

But there is a more interesting point here.  Consider [this quote from Sermon 11](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_11):

&gt;According to the Codes of Mephala, there is no difference between the **theorist** and the **terrorist**. Even the most cherished desire disappears in their hands. This is why Mephala has black hands. Bring both of yours to every argument. The one-handed king finds no remedy. When you approach God, however, cut both of them off. God has no need of theory and he is armored head to toe in terror.

Mepahala operates without desire.  She performs sex without lust and murder without fear.  And vice versa.  She is synchronous, in this respect, to Crowley's definition of Love Under Will: she seeks action without the desire for result.

To become a Ruling King, you must blacken your hands by becoming intimate with both Theory and Terror.  Logic and Hysteria, two chiral opposites.  Desire disappears in the hands of a Theorist, and fear does not exist in the hands of a Terrorist.    You become clear of mind and devoid of fear.

This could also be a part of the symbolism behind Vivec's title of "Mastery."  I'd argue that Almalexia, as the Warrior, controls the domain of **Terror**, or the Sword, and Sotha Sil controls the domain of **Reason**, or the Word.  Vivec controls both, which is why both of Mephala's hands are black.

This leads us at last to our connection with CHIM.  From [Vehk's Teaching, "…the Tower."](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/tower)

&gt;How to permanently exist beyond duplexity, antithesis, or trouble. This is not an easy concept, I know. Imagine being able to feel with all of your senses the relentless alien terror that is God and your place in it, which is everywhere and therefore nowhere, and realizing that it means the total dissolution of your individuality into boundless being. Imagine that and then still being able to say “I”. The “I” is the Tower.

Facing down the Godhead requires incredible bravery because God is armored head to toe in terror.  Simply being in its presence is terrifying, and commanding all the **Terror** in the world will not aid you.  Neither will **Theory**, for CHIM is a form of self-delusion, as you are insisting that you exist despite inarguable evidence to the contrary, and this requires an argument based on a complete lack of reason.

Because Vivec has knowledge of both Terror and Logic, it's arguable that he was the only member of the Tribunal to attain CHIM.  But mostly I'm just illustrating the connections between the Daedra and the process of CHIM.
