Now is the day of Resdaynia, where we Chosen are lead to test ourselves away from the weak and foolish of the west. We are here because we wish to be here. We live because we walk in the blood of those who dare question our lives; through this we know we are greater for we have reserved our place in freedom. We are not the Old Fools who live for stagnant existence and think they are born with the right to heaven, we know the difference between saying something is ours and taking it.



And who is our guide on our journey? No one. Not Azura, not Mephala, not even Boethiah. If we needed a guide we would have perished already. The men to the north-west have a guide and it is their downfall; they were lead and lost their leader who keeps his body above his test, his heart under flame, his blood under ground, his soul in an old hall and his nature in a bearded voice-murderer; such as his downfall will be their downfall. The Old Fools of Alinor had a leader too, whom harmed himself and cried foul for his own foolishness and as such the Old Fools blame their elders mistakes for they are too blind to see how to move on, as their leader never taught them how. 



Those who do not lead their own lives will perish, those who think such a thing will not happen are those who see their mistake with a blade through the chest. Boethiah is the greatest leader, for he does not tell us to follow but shows us the errors of others and the one true path that makes us realise that the love of stasis is ignorance in emotion; and that even the Doom Drum did not embrace change properly. We are not told to follow, we are shown a path and choose to walk it. None tell us how to live our lives, for if we did we would have failed the test. We follow the beliefs that are proven correct, we live because we have the will to do so. Another could not question this philosophy if we have already killed them. This is why the wise follow Boethiah's path laid to us, for Boethiah knew the death of the Doom Drum and Time-Bird would come and knows their people will follow suit where Boethiah remains glorious, strong and unharmed and wishes the same onto us.



Home is not what we call out and say is ours, but what we build or take and destroy those who claim what we have is not ours. Fire is not ours, but we can manipulate it however we wish for we will it; it may as well be ours. The Northern men have one thing right and that is their invader's spirit; nowhere is too far for their attempts at conquest and much like the 4 cornered House, they serve as yet further testing of our worth. But this does not mean that the more one kills of them the greater he is, that's a philosophy for the thick-headed northerners. But their desire to make their what is in their way theirs is, whilst savage, honourable.



Auri-El is perhaps the worst liar of all, his followers perhaps the most deceived. So much so they still believe his lies. How does one still manage to believe that one such static being could offer salvation? What are they waiting for on that island? Their precious knight to fly into the sun?! They still seem to forget the Trinimac followers became the ugly shame of Tamriel, such a proud warrior turned to filth is what became of the newly termed Orsimer and the same could happen to the Old Fools of Alinor.



Now are the days of testing, where we are the successors whom left the old methods and thoughts of ignorance. We are not of something original, for clinging to the old ways is to follow a path leading to nothingness. We are not of the trickster's teachings, for though his ideals were noble, his actions foolish and he received the death he deserved. But for us, we reserve a prayer for the inevitable:

*The fire is mine; let it consume me*

*And make a secret door*

*In the altar of Padhome*

*In the House of Boethiah*

*Where we become rewarded*

*And looked after.*
