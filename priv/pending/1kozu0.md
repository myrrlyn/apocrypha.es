*Disclaimer: This post enters into the domain of Quantum Physics and if my physics and my explanation is downright incorrect then I apologise and hope for a speedy correction.*

My personal favourite part of teslore is the dichotomy between the various characters of the Enantiomorph: King, Rebel and Observer (or for the newer scholars the Warrior, Thief and Mage of the Night Sky). Here the Lore of the TES universe merges with Quantum Physics and in this piece I hope to explain the Enantiomorph in it's purest and truest sense; that is the how mirror opposites can be equals (I.E Akatosh and Lorkhan).

To start lets look at the Quantum side of the explanation. In Quantum Physics all atoms have the possibility of being in any state at the same time, therefore they exist as 0 and 1 at the same time in a sort of [superposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition). This means that 0 and 1 are interchangeable and are one and the same (i.e 0 is 1 and 1 is 0 simultaneously).These positions do not become fixed until the advent of an observer (which is known in Quantum Mechanics as the [Observer Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)). With the arrival of an observer we get what is known as [Wave Function Collapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse). At this point the positions become fixed meaning that 0 is 0 and 1 is 1.

Upon changing the 0's and 1's to Kings and Rebels we see that the King and the Rebel aren't fixed positions/states. They too exist in both positions at the same time and exist as both sides of the same coin. This isn't until the Observer witnesses the two and their states become fixed. However there are differences between TES' Enantiomorph and the theories of Quantum Mechanics. The most obvious being that the different actors of the Enantiomorph are 'alive' and are enacting an event rather than being atoms changing states etc etc. Leading from that we know that the Observer becomes maimed from the act of Witnessing and that the Rebel takes the position of the King after his/its death.

After that long-winded explanation we get to the application of this theory onto TESlore examples. Starting off with Anu and Padomay we see that Anu and Padomay can be seen as either the King or the Rebel and it isn't until the unknown Original Observer witnesses them that Anu becomes the Rebel and slays the King, Padomay. Next we get to the 'merged dichotomy' that is Akatosh and Lorkhan who are said to be the same being but different. This is the crux of the explanation, Akatosh is Lorkhan and Lorkhan is Akatosh because they were both Rebel and King at the same time until Trinimac (the Observer) killed Lorkhan in the Observer effect. This made Lorkhan the King and Akatosh the Rebel yet because of their binary relationship prior to that event they are still linked and thus are 'two different sides of the same coin'.

I hope that completely explained the Enantiomorph relationship even for those who thought they fully understood it. If you think that I am wrong please correct me and if you have any unanswered questions please do ask.
