Here is my Commentary on Volume III of The Mythic Dawn Commentaries by Mankar Camoran

Enjoy!
______________________________________

&gt; The Tower touches all the mantles of Heaven, brother-noviates, and by its apex one can be as he will. More: be as he was and yet changed for all else on that path for those that walk after. This is the third key of Nu-mantia and the secret of how mortals become makers, and makers back to mortals. The Bones of the Wheel need their flesh, and that is mankind's heirloom.

The Tower permeates throughout all of Aurbis, as The Wheel IS Aurbis. To stand at it’s apex, in full understanding, one may become a Padomaic wave of change that can forever change the face of Mundus. The one who comprehends the Tower’s secrets, releases the chains that bind him. You have the power to roll through Aurbis as a Padomaic tidal wave of change, but you are still subject to a mortal death.

Another thing I’d like to add, the Selectives danced on their Tower and broke the Dragon for 1,008 years. During this time, these mortals became makers, bleeding and spitting out the Merish aspects of Auriel and/or mashing in bits of Lorkhan/Shor/Shezarr; thus making Akatosh. When the process ended, the makers became mortals again as their mythic dance had ended. I won’t get into the Monkey-Truth aspect of the Selectives mantling the Divines.

&gt; Oath-breakers beware, for their traitors run through the nymic-paths, runner dogs of prolix gods. The Dragon's Blood have hidden ascension in six-thousands years of aetherial labyrinth, which is Arena, which they yet deny is Oathbound. By the Book, take this key and pierce the divine shell that encloses the mantle-takers! The skin of gold! SCARAB AE AURBEX!

Here we see mention of Oath-breakers. Could this be a sly comment about ALMSIVI? The Tribunal did betray Nerevar and broke their oath to Azura in their acts of murder and apotheosis. They subverted worship and took the places of Boethiah, Mephala and Azura, whose nymics are long and tedious, or even better, prolix. 

As we continue reading though, these Oath-breakers refer to the Mnemoli.

&gt; Woe to the Oath-breakers! Of the skin of gold, the Xarxes Mysteriuum says "Be fooled not by the forlorn that ride astray the roadway, for they lost faith and this losing was caused by the Aedra who would know no other planets." Whereby the words of Lord Dagon instructs us to destroy these faithless. "Eat or bleed dry the gone-forlorn and gain that small will that led them to walk the path of Godhead at the first. Spit out or burn to the side that which made them delay. Know them as the Mnemoli."

First I’m going to start with a little head-canon stuff. I interpret this meaning the Mnemoli is the memory (Mnem is greek for memory) of failed Amaranths (or Amaranthine related endeavors). “Be fooled not by the forlorn that ride astray the roadway”, these failed Amaranths strayed from the Walking Way, losing faith or understanding. One must take the knowledge of their failures, so as to not fail yourself when you attempt to walk the path of the Godhead. Take their initial wisdom and disregard that which made them second-guess and consequently fail.

A more established interpretation of this is that the Mnemoli was around for the creation of Mundus. It witnessed the event and lost faith when Magnus left, so it followed, becoming one of the Star Orphans, becoming locked out of Mundus by the Structure of the Wheel and it’s spokes.

&gt; They run blue, through noise, and shine only when the earth trembles with the eruption of the newly-mantled.

Mnemoli can only enter Mundus during a Dragon Break. 

&gt; “Like many of her siblings, Mnemoli is both confused and delighted with the Aurbis, and explores its five quarters as best she can without the help and regulation of worship, which are not needed (by which I mean, always there) during breakings of the sideways wheel…”- [Vehk’s Book of Hours, Concerning the Dragon Break](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/vehks-book-hours-concerning-dragon-break)

During a Dragon Break, eight stars descend in the sky, possibly referencing the breaking of the spokes of the wheel. The Wheel is a wheel no longer, but a Hurling Disk: 

&gt; “Like many things they cannot explain, the middle dawn is merely another excuse to declare good omens and portents, but unto you it should be known as the Hurling Disk, numbered seventeen…”- [Vehk’s Book of Hours, Concerning the Dragon Break](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/vehks-book-hours-concerning-dragon-break)

The spokes are removed, thus removing the barrier blocking Mnemoli from visiting that which it fled in the Dawn. This is important as it is a way to enter and exit Mundus as one would please. Not to mention the Mythic Dawns obsession with the Dawn, Middle or otherwise. But that’s not all; to walk in the Middle Dawn can be as to walk in the mythic. An empire can span across stars, Cyrodiil can become an egg, a war stuck out of time fighting into the 5th era.

&gt; Once you walk in the Mythic it surrenders its power to you. Myth is nothing more than first wants. Unutterable truth. Ponder this while searching for the fourth key.

It seems during the Middle Dawn, mythopoeia has an even stronger influence on not only the (meta)physicalities of the Mundus, but even the history of the Hub. See the Selectives and Akatosh. This might have something to do with Mankar changing his history. Perhaps in my fifth part of the commentaries I will attempt to discuss it.

&gt; "First Tower Dictate: render the mutant bound where he may do no more harm. As God of the Mundus, alike shall be his progeny, split from their divine sparks. We are Eight time eight Exarchs. Let the home of Padomay see us as sole exit."

This quote is probably what inspired me to do these commentaries in the first place while discussing with /u/Mr_Flippers. The passage seems to written from an Aedric perspective, probably when discussing what to do with Lorkhan immediately before Convention.

Lorkhan is the mutant; this is because he was in the “family” of the other Aedra, yet a Padomaic force of change that tricked his contemporaries. Lorkhan’s progeny are alike, split from their divine sparks, sub-graded below the accepted definition of divinity; becoming mortal, weak, but in a better position for a Right Reaching. 

&gt; Let the home of Padomay see us as sole exit.

A perversion of the ideology of Lorkhan. If I could quote [Shor son of Shor](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/shor-son-shor-full):

&gt; "The Moot looked to the tribe of Ald son of Ald but he would break no oath of the Pact, saying "Shor has paid ransom now three times for the the sins we accused him of, and by that we will hold him as dead and shake not our spears against him or his kin. Of the below he speaks, he is confused by it, for under us is only a prologue, and under that still is only a scribe that hasn't written anything yet. Shor as always forgets the above, and condemns himself and any other who would believe him into this cycle."

Here, the Aedric chieftains are stubborn in the ignorant line of thought. They see themselves as the apex of mortal aspirations towards divinity. In a way they’re right, as moving up a gradient can equal divinity. But true transcendence comes from moving down. They are incapable of conceiving this notion as they are too self absorbed in their stasis to consider the possibilities. 

&gt; He that enters Paradise enters his own Mother. AE ALMA RUMA! The Aurbis endeth in all ways.
&gt; 
&gt; Endeth we seek through our Dawn, all endeth. Falter now and become one with the wayside orphans that feed me. Follow and I shall adore you from inside. My first daughter ran from the Dagonite road. Her name was Ruma and I ate her with no bread, and made another, which learned, and I loved that one and blackbirds formed her twin behind all time.

&gt; Starlight is your mantle, brother. Wear it to see by and add its light to Paradise.

Let’s look at Ruma first. Mankar killed Ruma and made another. Or he forced her to believe anew in someway, using a metaphor to describe this. Let’s assume he killed her and made another Ruma. “He that enters Paradise enters his own Mother”. What if Mankar made Ruma of Gaiar Alata? Similar to the conception of Reman, Gaiar Alata is a hill and the realm itself could have a sense of divinity in itself to allow for such a conception. Or Paradise, being Mankar’s realm, he could do as he pleased within it.

Regardless of any Ruma guesswork, Paradise is a rebirth. A Dawn member is literally rebirthed into/from Paradise, bound to it, even in death to be reborn again and again.

This is a really fun Volume to analyze. The Tower is a favored subject of mine, as well as Mnemoli and the Hurling Disk. 

I'm extremely glad I decided to do a fifth part to discuss the Commentaries as a whole. I hope and feel it will be a bit easier to tie things together versus one gigantic thread that could very well end up being an eyesore.

As always, I would appreciate thoughts, corrections, conversation and ranting in all shapes and forms.

Thanks!
