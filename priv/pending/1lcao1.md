Here is my Commentary on Volume IV of The Mythic Dawn Commentaries by Mankar Camoran

Enjoy!
________________

&gt; May the holder of the fourth key know the heart thereby: the Mundex Terrene was once ruled over solely by the tyrant dreugh-kings, each to their own dominion, and borderwars fought between their slave oceans. They were akin to the time-totems of old, yet evil, and full of mockery and profane powers. No one that lived did so outside of the sufferance of the dreughs.

This is an obvious reference to the Dreugh dominated Kalpa mentioned in the Sermons. I believe this is brought up to reference the rest of the Volume, being the timeline the following passages pertain to.

&gt; I give my soul to the Magna Ge, sayeth the joyous in Paradise, for they created Mehrunes the Razor in secret, in the very bowels of Lyg, the domain of the Upstart who vanishes. Though they came from diverse waters, each Get shared sole purpose: to artifice a prince of good, spinning his likeness in random swath, and imbuing him with Oblivion's most precious and scarce asset: hope.

Here we see the Magna Ge, or the Star Orphans. We know Mnemoli is of or formerly of this pantheon. In Volume III, Mankar seems to have a negative view towards Mnemoli, but the Magna Ge pantheon as a whole is a bit different. He credits this pantheon with the creation of Mehrunes Dagon in the bowels of Lyg (I would welcome thoughts on this and the Aldudagga version of Dagon’s “creation”).

What is Lyg you ask? Well let’s look at the Upstart who vanishes. This would imply Lorkhan, his domain being Mundus. So Lyg most likely refers to Mundus or Tamriel. In Monkey-Truth, Lyg is referred to as Shezarr, so take that with a grain of salt.

&gt; Deathlessly I intone from Paradise: Mehrunes the Thieftaker, Mehrunes Godsbody, Mehrunes the Red Arms That Went Up! Nu-Mantia! Liberty!
&gt;
&gt; Deny not that these days shall come again, my novitiates! For as Mehrunes threw down Lyg and cracked his face, declaring each of the nineteen and nine and nine oceans Free, so shall he crack the serpent crown of the Cyrodiils and make federation!

If Lyg is Mundus, Tamriel would be it’s face. Mehrunes dominated this Dreugh dominated Mundus and Mankar says he will do the same in the current Kalpa against the Cyrodiils. Another interpretation (what I personally believe) could be that Molag Bal was the face of Lyg as he was it’s ruler as the Ruddy Man. Dagon would mimic this with the plot against Uriel Septim VII and his heirs. Especially when one considers the serpent crown of the Cyrodiils most likely meaning the Emperor.

&gt; All will change in these days as it was changed in those, for with by the magic word Nu-Mantia a great rebellion rose up and pulled down the towers of CHIM-EL GHARJYG, and the templars of the Upstart were slaughtered, and blood fell like dew from the upper wards down to the lowest pits, where the slaves with maniacal faces took chains and teeth to their jailers and all hope was brush-fire.

Here we see CHIM-EL GHARJYG. Looks kind of like CHIM-EL ADABAL. But I don’t see much relation. Let’s try to dissect GHARJYG though. We see ‘GHAR’ in GHARTOK, or hand(s). Then JYG which can be related to order. Hand of Order. Add in CHIM-EL and we have something like The Royal/High Hand of Order. What would this have to do with these towers being pulled down?

The Towers uphold Mundus and in a way Order, for Mundus is an anchor for linearity. If Mundus is Lorkhan’s “baby” if you will, then one wouldn’t be too far off when relating ‘CHIM-EL GHARJYG’ with Lorkhan. Thus, the Towers upholding Mundus *can* be related to Lorkhan and this idea of CHIM-EL GHARJYG. Though this rails against the very idea of Lorkhan being a Padomaic. But flows well with the idea of static change.

Moving on.

&gt; Suns were riven as your red legions moved from Lyg to the hinterlands of chill, a legion for each Get, and Kuri was thrown down and Djaf was thrown down and Horma-Gile was crushed with coldsalt and forevermore called Hor and so shall it be again under the time of Gates.

It would seem that the campaign moved towards Coldharbour (hinterlands of chill). As to who Kuri, Djaf, etc are, I honestly have no idea.

&gt; Nothing but woe for NRN which has become The Pit and seven curses on its Dreugh, the Vermae NI-MOHK! But for it the Crusades would be as my lord's Creation, Get by the Ge and do as thou wilt, of no fetters but your own conscience! Know that your Hell is Broken, people of the Aurbis, and praise the Nu-Mantia which is Liberty!

First let’s talk about ‘The Pit’. We know Mankar tends to confuse the planes of Oblivion with their Princes. In his speech, Mankar says Peryite’s plane is Quagmire, when we know it’s the Pits. So let’s take this confusion and build upon it. That would mean, when Mankar mentions The Pit, he is mentioning Quagmire since Vaermina’s plane would be The Pit. NRN, or Nirn becomes a land of horrors. This is further supported by ‘Vermae NI-MOHK’, the Vermae being very close in resemblance to Vaermina. Though this time will be horrific, this destruction will bring about great change for the better, or so Mankar believes.

This will complete my individual commentaries on each individual Volume. I still plan on submitting a Part V to discuss the Commentaries as a whole. Be looking for that within the next week or so.

Thanks!
