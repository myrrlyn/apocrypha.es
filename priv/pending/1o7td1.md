For some time now, I have been working on a pet project to redesign the Dragon language in Skyrim (as some of you might know, Bethesda has done a very poor job of designing it). Since most of it is not established by lore, or even conflicting with it, I won't post it here. However, I didn't change anything about the pronunciation, so here it is.  
(The characters between brackets are the IPA spelling of the sound)

A [æ] as in b**a**n  
AA [a:] as in br**a** (uncommon in English)  
AH [ɑ] as in f**a**ther  
B [b] as in **b**ad  
D [d] as in **d**ay  
E [ɛ] as in f**e**ll  
EL [ɛl] as in f**ell**  
EY [ei] as in p**ay**  
F [f] as in **f**ail  
G [ɡ] as in **g**ood  
H [x] not present in English, pronounciation varies from Scottish-Gaelic lo**ch** (lake), to Dutch **g**aan (to go)   
I [ɪ] as in b**i**n  
II [i] as in s**ea**  
IR [ir] as in b**eer**  
J [dʒ] as in **j**olt  
K [k] as in **c**ool  
L [l] as in **l**ame  
M [m] as in **m**an  
N [n] as in **n**ight  
O [ɔ] as in d**aw**n  
OO [oʊ] as in b**o**ne  
P [p] as in **p**aw  
Q [k] as in **c**ool  
R [ʀ] or [r]^1 [R] does not appear in English, but is known as a rolling R (more akin to the Northern-Netherlandish R than the Scottish R), [r] as in bee**r**  
S [s] as in **s**nake  
T [t] as in **t**rait  
U [u:] as in d**o**  
UR [ʏr] not present in English, most akin to h**ur**t  
UU ?^2   
V [v] as in **v**iew  
W [w] as in s**w**ine  
X [ks] as in Ale**x**ander  
Y [j] as in **y**es  
Z [z] as in **z**oo  
(TH) [ð] or [θ]^3 ^4 either as in fa**th**er, or as in ma**th**  
(') [ʔ]^3 as the stop in uh-oh  


^1  when R appears at the start or the middle of a word, it is generally pronounced as [R]. At the end of the word, it is pronounced as [r]  
^2 while there is a individual letter for UU in the Dragon script, it has not appeared in any spoken form as of yet  
^3 While there are no individual letters for TH and ' in the Dragon script, they do appear in some words, for example: Thu'um (in which TH is treated as a distinct group, instead of individual sounds)  
^4 For the variation of pronunciation, the same rules apply as in English.
