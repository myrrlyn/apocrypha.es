I can't help but see the many similarities between the two cases; they have to be related, especially when Vivec killed the notion of coincidence.

**Hortator and Konahrik**

Warlords. Just as Hortator is the warlord of the Great Houses (minus Dres and Indoril in the case of the Nerevarine), so is Konahrik (literally meaning "warlord") to the Dragon priests/cult. In order for one to exist, a group that usually dislikes each other must come together and acknowledge someone as the right guy for a job bigger than them.

The problem with this is that we know who the Hortator was, but we don't know who Konahrik was (unless Konahrik was a figure now lost to time). It's likely that Vahlok the Jailor was once Konahrik, since it was he who had to battle Miraak to the point that Solstheim broke off from mainland Tamriel and he is the *only* Dragon Priest who doesn't have his mask. I believe that like the Hortator and Sharmat, Konahrik/Vahlok would have won the battle if only Hermaeus Mora didn't snatch Miraak away at the last moment.

**Sharmat and Miraak**

These two share much closer connections. The basic links, lust for power, ancient, etc. but it goes further than that. The Sharmat Dagoth Ur used two things extensively in his conqust, that is the divine disease Corprus and dreams. Dagoth Ur's link to dreams is much more significant as we know his whole "Sleeper has awoken" deal involving his warped perception of the universe; likewise he used Corprus to transform his followers as he was transformed.

Miraak is similar, though a little different. He too captures and twists the minds of the residents of Solstheim for his benefit. As their chant goes

&gt;  Far from ourselves, he grows ever near to us. 

&gt;Our eyes once were blinded, now through him do we see.

&gt; Our hands once were idle, now through them does he speak.

Which seems rather similar to Dagoth Gares line

&gt; But the Children of His Flesh, they are deep in the heart of his mysteries. Their bodies swell to contain his glory

Anyway, the name of the game for Miraak is manipulation, it's even in his name, which is "allegiance guide". Through dreams and Thu'um he twists the minds of mortals and dragons alike. His magic comes from his Shouts, whereas Dagoth Ur's came from the Heart of Lorkhan; though different sources, the point is the same.

**1 and 1**

The famous line from the 36 Lessons. for those who haven't read

&gt; Hortator and Sharmat, one and one, eleven, an inelegant number. Which of the ones is the more important? Could you ever tell if they switched places?

So, could you ever tell? If Miraak and Konahrik had fought so, could you tell the difference during the deafening Shouts? One is a powerful leader of a cult and the other... is a powerful leader of a cult. Could you ever tell if 1 and 1 switched places? Vivec can, but he's a special snowflake who can think beyond three-dimensional thought. Or Hortator and Sharmat, who won that fight in Red Mountain? When Dagoth Ur slept and Nerevar died from wounds, who could tell? Or when Dagoth Ur died and Nerevar lived? [1 and 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1kozu0/the_quantum_enantiomorph/) is hard to differentiate without someone to tell you who is who.

There are many things to say about this, but I suppose it's best summarised like this: When the traitor is present, the warlord must defeat him. Hortator must defeat Sharmat, Guardian must defeat Traitor, Konahrik must defeat Miraak.
