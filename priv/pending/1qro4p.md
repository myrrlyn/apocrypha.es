This is part of "Shezzar's Song" as it was originally told.

&gt;[...] and all the wise of the Et'Ada heard Shezzar's words and followed     [...] with all their holdings and courts and attendents [a]nd it was good.    
&gt;    
&gt;    
&gt;[...]    
&gt;    
&gt;
&gt;But now the Dragon spoke with his forked tongue:    
&gt;"    
&gt;Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, powers,    
&gt;If this magnific titles yet remain.    
&gt;Not merely titular, since by decree    
&gt;Another now has to himself engrossed    
&gt;All power, and us eclipsed under the name    
&gt;Of Lord of Dawn's New Beauty    
&gt;anointed saviour of the Aurbis    
&gt;Taking upon Himself the burden    
&gt;of all the Voids, that horridly    
&gt;gape within Anu's Realm.    
&gt;But see what he, our saviour    
&gt;hath done, what he    
&gt;required us to do    
&gt;The Voids all gathered, bound within    
&gt;Our boundaries    
&gt;bound by Our strenght!    
&gt;[...]    
&gt;Soon nought but void will sit     
&gt;here in the center     
&gt;unpleasing to the eyes of All.    
&gt;[...]    
&gt;Did he not promise us relief,    
&gt;rest from the fight against those    
&gt;gaping wounds; and their relent?    
&gt;While he adores himself now at the center throne    
&gt;Lowly we sink and are supreme    
&gt;in misery as we uphold    
&gt;his throne against the gathered voids that he    
&gt;had promised with his silver tongue    
&gt;to save us from.    
&gt;That Liar would rather have one grand    
&gt;And horrid Void that threatens to devour,    
&gt;not him, for he sits high atop the pile    
&gt;of Lesser spirits that obey    
&gt;His every ever changing whim than    
&gt;all those thousand lesser voids that we    
&gt;held back, with ease then, each his own    
&gt;realm fortifying and upholding then    
&gt;when we stood all alone and proud    
&gt;each then a world unto himself    
&gt;yet now we stand diminished and he sits    
&gt;upon his center throne    
&gt;with his false symbols; adorned by lies        
&gt;and signs that shamelessly defy       
&gt;and mock the plan and order of our maker    
&gt;and our Lord.    
&gt;[...]           
&gt;Let us unmake the Liar who has thus        
&gt;dirupted Anu's order and destroyed      
&gt;the stable equilibrium of our Courts.      
&gt;"     
     
The first five lines of Aka's speech are taken from Paradise Lost, Book V 772-775.                              
This is part of a larger piece which I am currently writing. I need some criticism on this part.
