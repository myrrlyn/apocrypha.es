The Tamrielic Pentalemma  (431e2-582e2) was  the first phase of the Interregnum between the Reman and Septim-Mede dynasties. A one-hundred and fifty-one year folio of strife, it began on the First of Morning Star 431, when Potentate Savarius Coracco was assassinated on his personal gondola by devotees of the Temple of Seth. Until then, under the Akaviri Potentate, the nobility of Cyrodiil's clients had found themselves utterly plagued with the itches of ambition.
 
When finally unfettered by the ministrations of that last vestige of Imperial authority, a rash of bloody havoc cut across the map in purpled varicose. Waging with death and daedra until only alliance would tender,  Five claimants for Imperator of the Cyrodiils, The Cyrodiil, would come: Caina Eblis, anon Alessia Cyrodiil, with the aid of Mannimarco, Sload, and Bal held the Sunder-Seat with Bone Legions; High-King Mjuntr The Boneless, anon Mantiarco Cyrodiil, with the aid of Mane Rimmen'Do, the An-Koutl of Argonia, and Hircine hounded the land as The Beasthold; Xeideres Camoran, anon Camoran Cyrodiil, with the aid of The Alinor and his lessers, The Ape-Lord Bug, and Hermaeus sought to subdue Dawn's Beauty in their Mora Camoris; the Yokeda Wolombu (high king) Jaan, anon Sejanus Cyrodiil, with the aid of House Hlaalu, the Direnni, and Vile ran mad and breathless as The [1st] Restless League; King Rohlstain of Kreath, anon Amalur Cyrodiil, with the aid of all Colovia, Versius Arrenaldus and his Dragonguard, Chieftain Wogturuk Gro-Smuthk, and Dagon tried for the throne as The Free Estates.
 
All five would come, spurt their vein-glory, then strike dead and head-less. The divisions wrought thereby would persist until the coming of Tiber Septim. 

It included such strife as:

The Brimstone Supper - 437, First of Last Seed, Imperator Amalur and his brother kings were poised to strike at the City Isle, and the eve of their siege they feasted. At the height of the fest, Imperatrix Alessia appeared in apparition with her cicisbeo, the infamous Mannimarco Tel Twil, mocked the Westermen for crude apes set demons upon them.

Ollis Bay Invasion - 500, Fifth of Sun's Height - Imperator Mantiarco III's Haafingarish seafyrd assists the An-Koutal with the reclaimation of their homeland from the treacherous and kin-selling An-Rchein, who subsequently attempt, yet thankfully fail, to use the Histfather of Perdition to genecide the Argonian bioclasm as a race-denial measure. Shortly thereafter, the very trees bow to the Nordic Cyrodiil.

The Flaying of Rihad - 512, Sixteenth of Second Seed - Imperator Camoran outwits Sejanus at Shalimar, leaving his rival shipwrecked while the Mora's forces sack a defenseless Rihad. The highlights of the slaughter include the city's curtain wall being hung with all the skins and unchoice butchery of the aristocracy.
