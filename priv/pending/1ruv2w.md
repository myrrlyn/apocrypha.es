**IceFireWarden, Hist Minder here. Today I’ll be trying to decipher possible links between with the Lizard-Men of the Swamps and the Serpent-Men of the East. Are they actually related somehow? Let us find out. So pull a chair, stoke the fire, and drink some Ovaltine. Commencing Talking.**

**JSYK (Just So You Know): I may use some of these sources two or three times in this piece, mainly because they include multiple interesting texts within them. You have been informed.**

**First Relationship: The Striking**

"The Spokes are the eight components of chaos, as yet solidified by the law of time: static change, if you will, something the **lizard gods** refer to as **the Striking**. That is the **reptile** wheel, coiled potential, ever-preamble to the never-action." – *36 Lessons of Vivec*

“Representations of the chim, and by extension the Psijic Endeavor, are always protean values, such as the anumidi models renowned by the Dwemer, the Scarab of contemporary astrolothurges, and **the Striking ("exact egg-cracking") of old Argonia**. All of these representations possess an innate and constant aspect of transformation.” – *More on the Psijic Endeavor*

“There was **the Striking**, and the Egg was split into **twelve worlds**, one for each serpent who had a name, and the names of the serpents were alive and coiled into themselves and became more eggs, for names are self-maters, and **the Naming** went and went. According to the calculations, the random sequence learned very cunningly that fragmentation reserved itself to the left eye. Variation realms were the evidence needed.” – *The Tsaesci Creation Myth and we ate it to become it*

“Oct 17 23:45:06 &lt;transcrybyr&gt; What is the **Exact-Egg-Cracking**? (Apologies if answered when I asked earlier, but xeno definitely wants me to get this one)
Oct 17 23:45:44 &lt;MK&gt; **The Hist version of the New Man**. Rather, the way **they** would do it.” – *MK Info-Dumps, part two*

For both races, the Striking seems to represent a notion of sudden, swift, but very powerful change. The first meeting between Anu (Stasis) and Padomay (Change) that resulted in the Static-Change that because the Aurbis can be considered the ‘First’ Striking. After that, the meaning changes of the Striking changes between the two races. Further in The Tsaesci Creation Myth, the Striking term also appears to represent Lorkhan’s actions in creating Nirn. In More on the Psijic Endeavor, the Striking represents the Argonian/Hist way of reaching CHIM.

**Second Relationship: Naming**

“…the Egg was split into twelve worlds, one for each serpent who had a **name**, and the **names** of the serpents were alive and coiled into themselves and became more eggs, for names are self-maters, and **the Naming** went and went…” – *The Tsaesci Creation Myth and we ate it to become it*

“My parents told me not to lick the Hist tree until my **Naming Day**, so I did. My parents caught me and a boy from my nest in a soft-leaf patch right before the **naming** ceremony. I feared I'd get more of a licking from my parents than I gave the tree... So I ran as fast as I could through the swamp and into the rest of the kids waiting for their **naming ceremony**. Everyone had a good laugh and the name stuck.” – *Traveling-New-Woman*

The usage of names is the second important link between the Tsaesci and the Argonians that is worth mentioning. In Black Marsh, every Saxhleel undergoes a ceremony known as a ‘Naming Day’. During this ceremony the young Argonian steps up to a Hist tree and licks it, ingesting its sap and becoming an teenager/adult by being given a name. The name the Saxhleel receives reflects on his/her behavior (e.g. Hides-His-Eyes; Traveling-New-Woman; Scouts-Many-Marshes) and sets them apart from their other kinsmen. To put it simply, an Argonian’s name is the very essence of their individuality.

In the Tsaesci Creation Myth, there are twelve worlds of creation for ‘each of the serpents who have a name’. The names were also ‘alive’ and became more eggs, for names are ‘self-maters’ and the Naming continued. To me, this sounds like the Tsaesci are recording the creation of the Aurbis and its self-expansion. As it expands, the universe consequently ‘names’ itself over and over again. Another tidbit I’m interested in is ‘the serpents who have a name’, but I’ll save that for later on in this document.

Overall, the process of Naming appears incredibly important to both cultures. Everything must have a name.

**Third Relationship: Egg Worldview**

“There was the Striking, and **the Egg** was split into twelve worlds…” – *The Tsaesci Creation Myth and we ate it to become it*

“Somewhere in Lilmoth is “the great stepped pyramid of **Ixtaxh-thtithil-meht ["exact-egg-cracker"]**. Only the topmost chamber jutted above the silt, but the An-Xileel had excavated it, room by room, pumping it out and laying magicks to keep the water from returning.” – *The Infernal City Lore Notes (Page 35 of the Infernal City)

“**Egg-Brother**.” ¬– *Common Word Used By Argonians To One Another*

Both the Argonians and the Tsaesci seem to have an egg-based view on the Aurbis, and it can be the reason why they use terms such as ‘Striking’, ‘Biting’, or ‘Laying’ in their societies. This view can also be a result (probably definitely a result) of both races connections with reptilian creatures.

**Fourth Reason: Gods**

“Bosmeri god of payment in kind. Studies indicate origins in both **Argonian and Akaviri mythologies**, perhaps introduced into Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order. His worship died out shortly after the Knahaten Flu.” – *About Z’en, God of Toil, from Varieties of Faith*

“'The Spokes are the eight components of chaos, as yet solidified by the law of time: static change, if you will, something the **lizard gods** refer to as the Striking. That is the reptile wheel, coiled potential, ever-preamble to the never-action.” – *36 Lessons of Vivec*

Out of all the information present, this is what piques my curiosity the most. The Argonian and Tsaesci pantheons are probably the least well known out of all the pantheons of Nirn. Z’en becoming an Elvish god after once being an Argonian god is fairly fascinating (in theory). But the connection with Akavir is where things start to get really interesting. It could fairly well be possible that Z’en is a shared entity between the Saxhleel and the Tsaesci.

In regards to the Lessons, the lizard gods can strongly hint or strongly not hint towards the Argonians or the Tsaesci. However, it is the use of the term ‘the Striking’ that leads me to believe that the passage may be referring to the deities of both groups.

**Fifth Reason: On Boethiah’s Summoning Day**

“The Worshippers of the Unnamed Lord, know as **'Argonians'** on Nirni, are the **Descendents of Boethiah and the Serpent-men**.” – On Boethiah’s Summoning Day

While not the most trustworthy source, this piece also strongly hints at a relationship –this time biological – between the Argonians and the Tsaesci. The Unnamed Lord clearly refers to Sithis/Padomay, and the text calls the Saxhleel its worshippers (this isn’t that hard to consider, giving the Argonians strong view on change in their society). The Serpent-Men are also clearly the Akaviri known as the Tsaesci, who share some attributes with the Daedric Prince Boethiah.
________________________________________________________
However, the Summoning Day basically states that somehow Boethiah and the Tsaesci got together and made little Argonians (essentially). This is weird, considering that it’s the Hist that gave the Argonian’s life. So what is the text implying?

**Hopefully this piece has intrigued people regarding any possible connections the Tsaesci have with the Argonians. Got to go now.**

**My own conjecture: The Hist, Argonians, and Tsaesci all originated on the same fragment of one of the twelve worlds of creation.**
