Hi all - I'm dinmenel, if you haven't pieced it together from my posts under this pretentious handle. I'm reposting this here because I neglected you guys before, and 'cause there's a puzzle at the end that no one has solved yet. There are more (and better) reasons behind the actions of the Dwemer than we usually acknowledge. But seeing them? That's not something I can bring down from a mountain. That's something you need to *climb* to.

So, if you're willing, answer this question: do the advocates of incomprehensibility play as queens... or as pawns?

Letters are clues. I'll be here, helping... and they'll be watching.
