The recent essays on the Ayleids have got me interested in what ultimately became of the Ayleidoon, and I thought about what the general public of Cyrodiil made of their province's former owners being shifted out into the wilderness, so I ended up writing this short thing. I hope you all enjoy it!


&gt; ‘Neath the trees,
&gt; 
&gt; ‘Neath the ground,
&gt; 
&gt; Making nary a sound,
&gt; 
&gt; The Bird-Goblins come out to play.
&gt; 
&gt; **
&gt; 
&gt; Flash of feather
&gt; 
&gt; Flash of claw
&gt; 
&gt; Too mad to withdraw,
&gt; 
&gt; The Bird-Goblins have come today.
&gt; 
&gt; **
&gt; 
&gt; Keep away, my sons,
&gt; 
&gt; Though there are fewer,
&gt;  
&gt; They are not the green ones
&gt; 
&gt; Who live in the sewer.
&gt; 
&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; They’re clever and cruel,
&gt; 
&gt; Tall and pale-faced,
&gt; 
&gt; Sons of Hadhuul
&gt; 
&gt; Should you see one, make haste!
&gt; 
&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; Dear old Colovia
&gt; 
&gt; Is not nearly as dear
&gt; 
&gt; When the Wild Elves 
&gt; 
&gt; Of ald-Cyrod draw near.
&gt; 
&gt;**
&gt; 
&gt; The Bird-Goblins are here to stay.
&gt;
