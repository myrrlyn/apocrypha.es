*By the IGS, in 3E 401*

There are several holidays called Father's Day troughout Tamriel. No common origin is apparent.    

    
The oldest Father's Day tradition is that of the Altmer. A central element in Auriel worship, Father's 
Day commemorates the siring of Alinor, the second king of Summerset, by Auriel.    
It serves to remind the Altmer that their kings are directly descendant from Auriel, and therefore 
from Anuiel and Anu itself.    
 
Bosmeri Father's Day celebrates Y'ffre as the father of the forest and All-That-Lives-In-It.   

The Dunmeri Father's day takes various forms.      
In the Indoril tradition, it is the day of Saint Nerevar, father of the House in its modern form and the 
nation of Morrowind itself. The Redoran and Hlaalu, as well as most minor Houses, do not celebrate 
this holiday. Rather, the individual families that constitute the Houses use the ocassion to honor the 
Tribunal as the Fathers and Mother of all Dunmer, benevolent living Ancestors. Since these 
festivities take place in or around the respective family tombs, they are believed to have evolved 
from ancient Chimeri practices of ancestor worship, specifically a tradition of honoring the family's 
founding father. Further evidence of this is the fact that House Dres still honors the family founders alongside the Tribunal.            

Nibenese and Colovian Father's Day are similar in that they both honor our Lord Father Akatosh, but 
are celebrated on different dates, with the Colovian practise likely diverging from the Nibenese 
original for petty reasons.

Bretonic Father's Day is a minor festivity celebrated only at the eastern borders of High Rock. It is a 
holiday in the honor of Akatosh and is known to be celebrated at different times each year, 
mirroring the Nordic tradition of [Kynstears](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1tjzv5/kynstears/).    

Probably the most outstanding Father's Day is the Redguard holiday "Papa's Day", which honors Tall 
Papa, Ruptga, the chief spirit of the Redguard pantheon and is widely considered one of the most 
important Redguard holidays.

Father's Day in Elsweyr is a rather odd ocassion, on which children are expected to present their 
sires with gifts, commonly made of moonsugar.
