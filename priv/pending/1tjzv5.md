Kynstears-Kyne's Tears- is a traditional Nord holiday that was still celebrated even in the early 4th era but has lost prominence since.    
It commemorates the sundering of Shor, or more specifically, the first rain that Kyne made after her husband's death. It is a day of gravity and remembrance, used to honor not only the Father of Men, but also all other dead Chieftains and Clan Fathers. It is sometimes considered the equivalent of the Father's Day tradition of other provinces.    

Incidentally, the [Father's Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1tjs5u/fathers_day/) of eastern High Rock is commonly celebrated at the same time as Kynstears, the day after the first not frozen rain of the year, which usually causes outbreaks of violence as the Nord consider a holiday honoring the Dragon celebrated at the same time as their Kynstears to be a cruel mockery and rude offense.
