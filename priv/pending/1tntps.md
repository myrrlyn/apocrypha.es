**Synod Archives on Daedric Artifacts (Part 2)** *153rd Year of the 4th Era, Marcus Averius, Synod Historian, Synod Artifact Recovery Division*

&gt;**Foreword:**

The following are records on the various Daedric Artifacts that the Synod has taken an interest on. This is a highly classified document only to be viewed by high ranking members of the Synod and the Item's retriever. It should be noted that not all sightings of these artifacts are confirmable, and some sources are unreliable hence they have not been stated here. The risk of retrieving the artifact is stated under the respective item's current situation section. The recovery team should prepare for any and all things to go wrong when dealing with a Daedric Prince.

&gt;**Mace of Molag Bal**

**Properties:**

The Mace of Molag Bal is a Powerful Daedric Arifact with the ability to transfer the life and magicka energies of its victim to the wielder. The Mace has been used more than once for the reverence of Molag Bal during his “rituals”

**Sightings:**

The Mace was reported to have been seen in the Illiac Bay region during the Warp in the West, the report states that a traveller was given the mace after said traveller assassinated a mage in Molag Bal’s name. Around 3E 427 the mace was reported to have been seen in Vvardenfell, yet the details elude us. The Mace was seen again during the Oblivion Crisis, the mace was seen being carried by a follower of Molag Bal, who was reported to have been killed the day before but was seen alive and in good health. The mace resurfaced back in 4E 139 in the province of Skyrim, and was reported to be an object of worship to Molag Bal’s followers.

**Current Situation:**

The Mace is likely still in Skyrim and being used in the Rituals performed by Molag Bal’s followers. Exactly where in Skyrim, is unknown. The recommend we set the priority on the Mace’s retrieval at High, the Mace is a symbol of Molag Bal’s power and is revered in many Ancient Vampire Clans throughout Tamriel. If these Vampire Clans believe we work for Molag Bal, we may be able to gain influence among these groups, and possibly *retrieve* any artifacts they have. The risk in obtaining this artifact is also set at high, since the guardians of this mace would likely guard the Mace till death.

&gt;**Skull of Corruption**

**Properties:**

The Skull of Corruption is an ancient Staff created by the Daedric Prince Vaermina. The Staff is said to have the power to create a mirror image of its target, to be used as a thrall. The staff is also known for its ability to cause “Waking Nightmares” unfortunately no accounts detail exactly what happens during these nightmares. The source of the staff’s power is unknown but it is said that it is the very power of Vaermina herself that guides the staff, which is said to have a mind of its own.

**Sightings:**

The staff was seen during the Oblivion Crisis being carried by a follower of Vaermina who was at the time exploring an unnamed ruin. This follower was reported to have been given the staff by Vaermina in exchange for an unknown orb shaped object, this could very well be the Orb of Vaermina if this is true then the orb is no longer in Nirn, and searching for it should be ceased immediately. According to one of our sources at the Vigil of Stendarr, a decade ago a patrol of Vigilants encountered a large group of Vaermina cultists, carrying what appears to be the Staff. The patrol confronted them directly but was overwhelmed and suffered casualties. The sole survivor limped back to Falkreath, a city located near the road the encounter took place. The Vigilant reported that the Cultists were headed North, and that during the battle he detailed how he was “seeing nightmares” while he was awake. This may be the first account of a waking dream but the Vigilant has a known history of hallucinations, hence we cannot confirm this.

**Current Situation:**

The Staff is known to be located, in the Northern reaches of Skyrim, sources suggest that the Cultists reside in a temple near the Port City of Dawnstar, and another source suggests that it was moved to the Wrothgarian Mountains near Wayrest. We have sent retrieval groups to these locations, yet no word has come of them. The retrieval priority for the Staff has been set to high, as it can be used as an effective yet bloodless solution against the Synod’s enemies. The risk however has also been set to High as our attempts to retrieve it has led to multiple failures.

&gt;**Wabbajack**

**Properties:**

The Wabbajack is the Daedric Artifact of Sheogorath, otherwise known as the Mad God. The staff is a fitting weapon for Sheogorath as it is known to have random effects when used. These effects range from Shooting lightning to polymorphing a target into a random creature or object, such as a common delicacy known as a Sweetroll.

**Sightings:**

An unnamed Champion of Sheogorath was reported to have received this staff after causing mass panic in the Khajiiti settlement North of Leyawiin known as Border Watch.  A Bravil Guard later saw this Champion of Sheogorath entering an Oblivion Portal going the mad God’s Realm. Whether or not this Champion was carrying the staff back to Sheogorath is unknown.

**Current Situation:**

The Staff is most likely back in the possession of Sheogorath once more; it is likely that we will not see the staff again until it is given to another Champion of Sheogorath. I recommend we not spend any resources in retrieving this staff, until we get a good report on its whereabouts. If however we do get a report the risk in retrieving this will be high, and only agents with a strong will be sent to do this task, since the Mad God is known for driving people insane.

&gt;**Daedric Crescent Blade**

**Properties:**

The Daedric Crescent Blade was once a standard issue weapon to the forces of Mehrunes Dagon that invaded the Battlespire. When the Empire retook the Battlespire, all but one of the Crescent Blades were destroyed. The Crescent Blade has the ability to paralyze its targets, and deal large amounts of damage to the enemy’s armor.

**Sightings:**

The last remaining crescent blade was owned by a Dremora Lord who resided in Vvardenfell. At one point during the 3rd Era, an unnamed traveller defeated this Dremora Lord and claimed the Crescent Blade, who this traveller was is not recorded. There have been rumours that the Blade was seen in the floating City of Umbriel yet these claims have no proof. Another claim stated that the Blade was seen being used by a Bosmer Noble residing in Elden Root. Another claim states that the Blade is used by an Argonian warlord somewhere in Black Marsh.

**Current Situation:**

The Archmagister has ordered this Artifact to be put at a High priority and that it be placed in his personal treasury. There have been several attempts to search for the Crescent Blade but all have returned with no avail. However travel to Valenwood and Black Marsh has been difficult of late due to the tensions between the Empire and the nations of Argonia, and the Aldmeri Dominion. Hence the risk for the retrieval of this item has been set to medium, and retrieval teams are ordered to practice leniency at all times in foreign nations.

&gt;**Ebony Mail**

**Properties:**

The Ebony Mail is a piece of ebony armor created by the Daedric Prince Boethiah, who also decides who has the right to wear it.  The armor protects its wearer from magical attacks and has the ability to shroud its wearer in darkness. Another property this Artifact is known to have, is the ability to poison enemies who go near the wearer.

**Sightings:**

The Ebony Mail was seen being used by the Nerevarine at one point around the year 3E 427, though whether this was really the Nerevarine or an impersonator is unknown. Last year a series of murders and raids were committed in the Provinces of Highrock, Hammerfell, and Skyrim. The Prime Suspect is a dunmer who claims to be the champion of “the Prince of Plots” otherwise known as Boethiah. This elf has been reported to wear armor that fits the Ebony Mails description perfectly.

**Current Situation:**

This self –proclaimed Champion of Boethiah has been chased down by the Vigil of Stendarr on the crimes of Daedra Worship for months now. A recovery team is working with the Vigil to track this elf, though they do not know that we are actually in it for the Daedric Artifact he carries. The recovery priority for this Artifact is set to normal, as our recovery teams are currently pursuing artifacts of greater value. And the risk factor for this Artifact is set to high, the elf that possesses this Artifact is known to be a skilled fighter and has evaded the Vigil, and local Guards many times.
