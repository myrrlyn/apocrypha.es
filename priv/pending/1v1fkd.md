The Dreamsleeve is a magickal connection that all of us share, which now allows us to communicate with other people, regardless of distance.

But this connection was not very widely known, until very late in the Fifth Era when a Nord, only known as “the Infomancer,” in Saarthal uncovered knowledge of the Dreamsleeve and devised a method by which anyone and everyone could use it for mundane functions, unassisted by machine. Using this method, a person is able to create and review private information packets, known as "memospores," while still performing other tasks. The method spread quickly across the world, and soon traditional methods of note-taking and journaling were supplanted by use of the Dreamsleeve.

However, the Infomancer did not believe this was the full potential of the Dreamsleeve, as ancient knowledge spoke of connection to other users and their memospores. The Infomancer continued to study the Dreamsleeve and created many devices to aid and enhance connection, and finally, the Infomancer created a design that utilized a metal ring around the head of the user, encased in rubber except for two contacts on the back of the head, which allowed its user to view memospores from and contact any others connected by the same method. 

Initial devices like this were manufactured attached to chair-like apparata, because they also required the temporary incapacitation of the user. Recently, however, advances have been made that allow a user to use a device while remaining conscious, similarly to the unaided method.

The Infomancer's work became the basis for much of the products and services that WYVERN provides today. Unfortunately, we will never know the Infomancer's true name, as he was assassinated and mostly info-wiped early in the Sixth Era.
