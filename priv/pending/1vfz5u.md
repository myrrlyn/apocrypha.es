**Hello everyone, IceFireWarden here. Everyone probably knows when it comes to Convention and the Enantiomorph, I’m mostly eh (I do Argonians, Hist, &amp; Peryite stuff, what did you expect?). But this is a piece I’ve been thinking and working on for quite sometime, so…drink with Ovaltine. Hope you enjoy.**
_____________________________________________________________

Rebel. King. Observer.

Thief. Warrior. Mage.

These are the three figures that make up the Enantiomorph, the process where three persons perform the act of “subcreation”, and give rise to another level of subgradient. In other words, the Rebel, King, and Observer divide their power to create a higher power.

But there sees to be something missing. To be more specific, there seems to me that *someone* is missing. In all Enantiomorph events, there is always someone that is present at the events, but never directly interacts with the occurrence, but the outcome affects them just the same.

That is why I’m proposing the idea of a fourth element in the Enantiomorph equation: The Champion.

In every Enantiomorph event, there is always someone who aids the Rebel. Trinimac aids Auri-El (Rebel). Indoril Nerevar aids the Tribunal (Rebel). King Cuhlecain aids Tiber Septim (Rebel). They are the Champions. The Champions job in the Enantiomorph Event is to help the Rebel *usurp* the King, but they never live long enough to see the Rebel *become* the King (except Trinimac, but I’ll go into detail about that later on in this piece).

Let’s take a look at all three events.

**ENANTIOMORPH 01: MUNDUS**

In this EE (sorry, I’m getting tired writing Enantiomorph) the Rebel is Auri-El, the King is Lorkhan, the Observer is Magnus, and the Champion is Trinimac, with the former three dividing their power to help create the higher power known as Mundus. Once the Mundus is created, Magnus (as the Observer) flees from it and enters Aetherius. Auri-El and his Army then (as the Rebels) challenge Lorkhan and his Army (as the Kings). Trinimac aids Auri-El (playing the part of the Champion) and helps him kill Lorkhan. Trinimac, unlike Nerevar or Cuhlecain, *initially* lives through to see Auri-El become King as time has not been fully established at this time (Haha, see what I did there?)

Nevertheless, Trinimac does eventually die from this EE. During the Chimer Exodus, Trinimac is ‘eaten’ and consumed by Boethiah, and his remains become the Daedric Prince known as Malacath. This is the place where Trinimac, as the Champion, ‘dies’.

And so ends the first EE.

**ENANTIOMORPH 02: TRIBUNAL’S ASCENSION**

In this EE, the Rebel is the Tribunal (Vivec, Sotha Sil, and Almalexia respectively), the King is Azura/Boethiah/Mephala (the Original Tribunal), the Observer can be either Alandro Sul or Voryn Dagoth (Sul goes blind during the events at Red Mountain while Dagoth becomes initially half-dead). The Champion is Nerevar, and the higher power that the Rebel/King/Observer create from their divided power is the Tribunal’s divinity.

(Note: For the explanation below I will be using Dagoth as the Observer)

Nerevar (the Champion) aids the Anticipations (the Rebel) during the Battle of Red Mountain and through mysterious events is killed, but not before telling his friends not to use the Heart of Lorkhan. The Anticipations break their oath to Nerevar and use the Heart of Lorkhan to displace the Original Tribunal (the King) and become “Three-In-One” as ALMSIVI. Dagoth (the Observer) watches the Anticipations achieve divinity with the Heart as he himself had somehow forged a connection with it before he ‘died’.

And so ends the second EE.

**ENANTIOMORPH 03: CONVENTION 2.0**

In this EE, the Rebel is Hjati Early-Beard/Tiber Septim (Auri-El), the King is Wulfharth (Lorkhan), the Observer is Zurin Arctus (Magnus), and the Champion is Cuhlecain (Trinimac). The higher power that the former three create is Convention 2.0 – which is Talos – and the Mantella, which powers Numidium.

Cuhlecain (the Champion) aids Hjati (the Rebel) unite all of Tamriel during the Tiber Wars. However, this EE has a rather unique case as Cuhlecain originally thinks that he is the Rebel (to Cyrodiil) with Hjati being his Champion. Cuhlecain, however, dies and Hjati becomes Emperor. Later on, Hjati has Zurin (the Observer) betray Wulfharth (the King) by using his heart (which becomes synonymous with the Heart of Lorkhan) to power the Mantella. It also causes them to become “Three-In-One” and form Talos.

And so ends the third EE.

**CONCLUSION**

Well, I’m done. I just wanted to write this to help explain some key concepts about the EE, specifically why there always seemed to be Four involved but it only focuses on the Three. I also wanted to explore my own personal theory about the ALMSIVI being the Dunmer Tower (as they become a “Three-In-One” entity similar to Talos using the Heart of Lorkhan), with their divinity being their Stone. When the Nerevarine ‘destroys’ the Heart of Lorkhan, ALMSIVI deactivates because their divinity – their stone – is destroyed.

An EE always results in the creation of a Tower.
