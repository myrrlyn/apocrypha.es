Note: First off, I apologize for the fake name that was put down; perhaps some prankster went and changed it. Why this occurred, I am not sure, but I was not amused (though many were, for understandable reasons). Moving on from certain jokes, some attentive readers may remember that a while ago, some persons had discovered a text about a vessel that had been taken over by the God of Worms. This vessel has since been discovered and cleansed; my only regret is that many Senche-raht died to deliver this information. What the Explorer's Guild has since discovered is that this vessel has been to every body in the Mundus, and that through them, we now know what to find should we ever set foot beyond LKHN (which, considering the massive progress we've made, is highly likely). First off, we have the system of MHARA, so called for reasons soon to be explained towards the end. In time, there should be more writings for each plane deciphered; it is difficult to read necromantic parchment.- Phallus Largus, 5E70

&gt;# Captain's Log, 4E?/5E? [Inconceivable], [Flee from me, Meridia]
&gt;# Writer: Ocato Adal, Vessel Captain

&gt;Not a day goes by when I think about Nirn. I will never forget the Landfall, and we will be affected forever more. Except for the Hist, but after their Morrowind invasion, I still don't get why they stopped there. Lack of ambition, perhaps? Whatever the reason, perhaps if they took over, the land would still be the same.

&gt;But no matter what goes on, all the races of Tamriel are safe, and now my purpose remains the vessel's mission. My crew has been anxious in this system, and we think it should be rather hospitable. I intend to send a duo of Geldis and Afeliz down to the smallest body. Geldis should have the magicka needed to return to the vessel in case something goes wrong, and Afeliz can fend for the both of them quite easily, being quite the ferocious Pahmar-raht. I do have precautions however, and Torug has devised methods of breathing that should allow both of them to survive long enough to escape. (On another note, those rings are something that should be standard in all armaments from here on out.) We go forward with all the hope that, to quote the Chronicler Haming, 'that we seek out a better place to call home, be it mer, man, beastfolk, or tree.' Now then, where is that report on the vessel's garden....

&gt;# Interview of the body exploration, conducted by vessel Chronicler Haming Torsosplitter.

&gt;H: Forgive me for having you two speak at a time like now, but we simply must go and record what happened. Geldis, can you describe what the exploration was like?

&gt;Geldis: Do you really think now is a good idea, Haming? I really don't want to talk about it.

&gt;Afeliz: Come now Geldis, it was not that bad.

&gt;G: Says the one who didn't suffer

&gt;A: Bare in mind that I did go and nearly got distracted by the beautiful imagery; if not for your cries, I would not have snapped out of it.

&gt;G: Did you just make fun of my situation, you idiotic housecat?

&gt;A: WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?

&gt;H: Can you two please stop arguing? Look Geldis, no one would have wanted that to happen, but like it or not, it did bring lots of information. And the pain should wear off in two days.

&gt;G: Four.

&gt;H: Oh, sorry... anyways, Afeliz, why don't you start to describe the exploration?

&gt;A: Alright then. Upon landing, we surveyed the area. We were in a vast forest, and could not see any animals. There were a lot of plants, however, as far as the eye can see. The first thing I suggested was that we should go and find higher ground. So, we proceeded up a hill with a bit of a clearing. 

&gt;H: Geldis, could you describe what you saw?

&gt;G: Do I have to?

&gt;A: I don't see how the pain could stop that.

&gt;G: This pain has stopped many things, key among them-

&gt;H: Are you going to answer or not, Geldis?

&gt;G: Fine, sorry Haming. Atop the hill, we were able to see far- and I mean really far. We saw a forest, much like I heard about Cyrodiil before Tiber Septim. It was thick, and I could see much vegetation, with a stream breaking here and there. It seemed almost like something out of a painting. It was truly beautiful. But I noticed things get weird when we found a stream on the other side of the hill.

&gt;H: What was odd about this stream, Afeliz?

&gt;A: Well, it was not as clear as most water would be. It seemed to be a bit milkier, like a blind man's eyes. I had Geldis put some in a bottle, and there should be a report on it soon. [It is worth noting this report is still being searched for.- P.L.]

&gt;H: And it was at this point where you... realized what the plant life was like?

&gt;G: â€¦ Yes.

&gt;A: There was no funnier way to discover it than that. 

&gt;G: It was painful and you know it!

&gt;A: It may be painful, but it was funny.

&gt;G: It was not funny, you tiny cub!

&gt;A: I AM NOT TINY!

&gt;H: Afeliz, Geldis, please! We know it was an accident that you fell on the male plant and it extended up your insides, but we have at least removed most of it, and Cayleigh should get rid of the rest of it soon after this.

&gt;G: I am never going to be able to evacuate my bowels normally again, you know that?

&gt;H: We don't know that. Look, despite the pain, it was an overall success, and we have the female genitalia and male genitalia samples being studied in the garden with some dirt that accidentally got brought aboard. We will figure out why it extended so far, and no one will ever suffer again. What is the verdict on the mission, Afeliz?

&gt;A: It was a success. Mostly. But the failures were at least humorous. 

&gt;G: Humorous, kitten!?

&gt;A: YOU WOULD DARE SAY THAT?!

&gt;H: Enough! Afeliz, you are dismissed. Geldis, stay in bed until Cayleigh shows up. 

&gt;Cayleigh: Somebody mention me?

&gt;H: Oh, hello Cayleigh, glad you are... what in Shor's name is that cane with a claw on the end?

&gt;C: For excavations. Now Geldis, bend over....

&gt;G: Help me Azura, you're my only hope....


#&gt;Ship condition: Report by Tadriel Elmlock, apprentice to Torug gro-Morgon

&gt;So far, we are still in good condition, despite some magicka setbacks. Fast has managed to chart a route that will help us conserve our reserves, and frankly, that Argonian has probably bought us enough time to visit all the worlds, and still return to Masser if need be. Anyways:

&gt;Magicka reserves: Much is lost, but irrelevant due to our route.

&gt;Garden: Plant, fungi, and food production is still going strong. Recommend that soil samples be mixed in to increase growth rate by garden staff. Do not mix in liquid samples, 

&gt;Bridge: Top tier condition. Cupholders have been installed by Torug successfully. 

&gt;Plumbing: Fine, but slightly clogged. Do not have foods from Elsweyr in the future.

&gt;Dwemer engines: Working. No idea how well, but enough to send us around and operate things.

&gt;Living quarters: Cupholders installed successfully by yours truly. Still complaints of being cramped.

&gt;[The remainder is inconceivable, except for one line:- P.L.]

&gt;Hull: Holding, but in case of emergency, I recommend the plant that went up Geldis as potential replacement for a breach.

#&gt; Writer: Ocato Adal, Vessel Captain

&gt;After yesterday's mostly successful mission (and with the foreign material removed from Geldis, the largest impact is no longer being felt), I have decided to go ahead with embarking to a new plane. Yes, these are planes, similar to Oblivion, but at least so far they haven't had murderous denizens. The discussion of this realization seems to still go through everyone, but it shouldn't effect the next exploration. Afeliz has volunteered to go down again, but I have decided to let the Senche-raht rest, she has done more than enough. Cato has volunteered, and I have excepted his request. In addition, Tadriel has requested to go down, and I have accepted, though Torug is worried to no end. Oh well, those crossbows he retrofitted to fire pure magicka should be useful if there are hostile denizens (and the same goes for his enchanted breathing rings if there is no way to breathe). I wonder why he did not reveal this until I put Tadriel into harm's way; I should probably ask if their feelings are still professional, or taken a turn to something more. No matter what, the team is ready, and this rather large-looking plane is going to be explored....

#&gt; Interview of the plane exploration, conducted by vessel chronicler Haming Torsosplitter

&gt;Haming: Well then, this should be interesting, to say the least. 

&gt;Cato: Indeed, it is, though at least in a way that didn't require the crossbows.

&gt;Tadriel: Even then, it was worth the effort, despite how long it took.

&gt;H: Slow down, Tadriel, I haven't even started asking questions yet. All will be discussed in due time. Now, would you describe the exploration Cato? 

&gt;C: Sure, Haming. Upon setting foot on the surface, we were on a vast plain. It was dark out, and could not see very far. That, however, was no problem. The ground itself was bright.

&gt;H: Tadriel, could you explain to us why the ground was bright?

&gt;T: It was all sorts of minerals, shining brightly. Silver, gold, orichalcum, even ebony and dwemer metals were in abundance, the most pure available. Much of it was dented and mixed with bits of other metals, but I believe the first non-metal material that this contacted was Cato and I. 

&gt;H: Was there anything else to note?

&gt;C: There was a small hill in the distance, more like a mound when I think about it, so we went and walked up it. It was easy going, even if I did slip and fall a few times.

&gt;T: It is difficult to climb up such a smooth surface. I should know.

&gt;C: How do you know?

&gt;T: You should know as well, Cato. I fell down too.

&gt;H: Well then, why did you fall down? There must have been some traction.

&gt;C: The metals here were ludicrously smooth, I couldn't really get solid footing. Also ludicrously hard, I might add. Not even our swords could cut a dent when we swung them. However, we could chip a small bit off when we stabbed with the strength of both hands. I believe a pickax would help, though not that much. In any case, we made it up the hill, and proceeded to look down upon the other side.

&gt;H: What did you witness?

&gt;T: Nothing but the same as before. Ridiculously smooth slope going down, and a plain, with more hills dotted about. It was odd, to say the least. The only difference from the rainbow of metals was us, faintly glowing from our enchantments.

&gt;H: And it was at this point you realized that the only reason you hadn't keeled over was because of your breath enchantments?

&gt;C: Yes, it was. We were so mesmerized by the sheen from the metals, we failed to noticed when we would have.

&gt;H: What did you decide to do then?

&gt;T: We continued to walk, looking around. After about 15 minutes, however, we realized that, apart from the metals, this plane was dead. Nothing but a repeat of plains and small hill-mounds. Even the bright metals continued to get boring after awhile. Bored of shiny rich items? Who would ever get bored of that?

&gt;H: I would, easily.

&gt;T: Says the one in a love affair with Steel. You would have been as bashful as a child with his crush if you saw the same things we did.

&gt;H: I wouldn't.

&gt;T: You would, and you know it.

&gt;H: Ugh... let's just move past this. What did you do when you stopped walking?

&gt;C: We decided to break out our weapons and try cutting off some gold. Might as well since we were here. It took... longer than expected.

&gt;H: That's one way of understating 6 hours for what amounts to half a Septim apiece.

&gt;C: Well, it was worth it, I feel. It may have been extremely difficult to crack, but it feels like I earned it. Still, I make more of a living with you guys than I would with a pickax and an hour down there. 

&gt;H: So then, do you feel that the exploration was a success? 

&gt;T: Despite the massive amounts of money just waiting to be harvested, no. Without air or much of anything, this is nothing more than a time waster just waiting to happen. 

&gt;H: Well then, most people wouldn't say that.

&gt;C: Most people don't realize it's far easier to work hard at a job then to mine down there. 

&gt;T: You sound like a preacher at the Chapel of Zenithar, Cato. But indeed, those are exactly my thoughts on the matter.

&gt;C: I sound like a preacher? Well then, fitting for this plane, isn't it? Besides, the amount of refinement needed to get other metals off is also a hassle anyways, and I'm not in the mood to get quicksilver off my gold.

&gt;H: Better quicksilver then iron anyways. Now then, who wants Elsweyr fondue?

&gt;T: No thanks. I am NOT clogging the plumbing again.

&gt;H: Alright then, how about some salmon?

&gt;C: Why not with goat cheese melted on top and some carrots on the side?

&gt;H: That would be nice. Let's get moving, I am getting tired of recording everything.

&gt;T: You are way too detailed, you know that Haming?

&gt;H: Yes I do, Tadriel. Yes, I do.


Navigation Report: Compiled by Hauls-Ropes-Fast

Based on the movements of all in the Mundus, we should have time to see the last plane before we must move. Our position in this infinite land is going to result in stranding us here for a month otherwise, but if we leave early enough, I should be able to make good on reaching the next plane. 
Whatever is your call, Captain, we will follow you, but I recommend you send out a team in the next two days. Hurry up with it, and there shouldn't be any problems. Besides, I am not in the mood to be stuck here.

Also, the orrery is becoming more and more off; soon, I will be unable to compensate for it anymore and will have to rely on other methods, like the identification of various constellations. Please have alternate solutions ready if the orrery does at some point fully fail; starlight gets very confusing out here, and I do not want to be leading us into the middle of nowhere without enough magicka to save us. Pass this request along to Torug, he might have some stupid contraption that can help. 

Not so sincerely, Hauls-Ropes-Fast


Note to Fast, from Torug gro-Morgon

You claim you have troubles with the stars? When looking at them, use this tube to see them, smaller looking glass facing your eye. It should help somewhat.- Torug

&gt;So, with the rivers on the genetalic plane actually providing no nourishment whatsoever to anything, and the other just being a chunk of difficult to obtain metals without even air, this place seems dead to non-plant life, with the last one being dead to just about everything. According to Navigator Fast, we have a week before we must leave to be on track with what resources we have, and I find that when I look into the matter of supplies and resources on my own, she is completely right. This will not prove well, especially if her ego gets out of hand; this is my vessel, and it will be, no matter how much she acts like she's in charge. Now then, with the coming exploration, I can merely hope that good things come from the duo of Torug and Fast.

#&gt; Interview of the plane exploration, conducted by vessel chronicler Haming Torsosplitter

&gt;Haming: Are you two alright? It seems as if you are... different.

&gt;Fast: I assure you, we are still the same beings that we were before we were sent down. 

&gt;Torug: The same being? Look at how you sound, Fast, you come across as completely different from what you were.

&gt;F: I am the same. And you will take note of it. Are we clear?

&gt;T: Yes.

&gt;H: You are definitely still the same if you insult Torug like that. Try not to keep it up.

&gt;F: I do what I want with that skinny Orismer. 

&gt;T: Hey!

&gt;H: Aaaand that's enough. Now then, could you please describe the exploration Torug?

&gt;T: Upon setting foot, I found that the earth felt soft. My boots started to sink a bit, but I could still move about alright. It's almost like the ground itself wanted to hug me, to care for me evermore-

&gt;F: Snap out of it! There is more to it than mud. 

&gt;H: Fast, do us all a favor and calm yourself. Now, could you describe other parts of the plane aside from the ground?

&gt;T: Oh, sorry. We were in a mountainous region, near the top of a peak. Since said peak was flat, we ended up going to the top in order to get a look around. 

&gt;H: And this was all just dirt that you sunk slightly into?

&gt;F: It was for him, I certainly did not sink in.

&gt;T: You did!

&gt;F: Did not.

&gt;H: The dirt on your boots would like to say otherwise, Fast. Now then, could you describe the view of the plane from that height? 

&gt;F: Massive, to say the least. I understand that the highest point in Tamriel was the Throat of the World, and that it was difficult to reach there indeed. But this height was massive, far more massive than that, and I distinctly believe that this height dwarfs anything that Tamriel could ever present to us. That plane was just mystifyingly amazing from it's height. And there were higher peaks that we could see from there! Our breathing rings helped give everything a nice glow as well.

&gt;H: Intriguing, to say the least. Soon after you two made it to the top, one of you fell off. Which one was it, and how far did you fall?

&gt;T: I fell, Haming. I landed in the bottom of a valley, in a river.

&gt;H: How long did it take for you to hit the ground?

&gt;T: About half an hour.

&gt;H: How are you still alive?!

&gt;F: This is where things get odd. I climbed down faster than he fell. It seems like the earth made us faster, but when someone was in danger, they would be protected. It worked for me too; when I lost my footing and tripped, I fell slowly into the earth. Not only that, it seemed like it moved out of the way of my mouth when I hit it.

&gt;H: So you can fall for hours and not die from it? That sounds like a glorious exploration. I'd love to go back there some day.

&gt;F: Too bad then. You should have spoken up, perhaps Adal would have let you go down instead of this oaf.

&gt;T: Please, Fast, I am not an oaf. 

&gt;H: Torug is right you know. Now then, what was this river like?

&gt;T: The river felt lukewarm, the same amount of heat as outside it. It was deep, but clear enough that I could see the bottom. It was more earth, but it had plant life, of all things. 

&gt;H: That's what was in the bottle?

&gt;F: Yes, it was. Torug went and swam down to bottle some up, along with some roots and dirt. It took a while, to say the least. 

&gt;H: I assume that the need to resurface for air would have been a bit annoying if not for your rings?

&gt;T: Actually, the rings never glowed while I was down there. 

&gt;H: Wait a minute. The rings worked while you were above the water, but not when you were in it?

&gt;F: It wasn't a problem for either of us though. I can tell when I breathe in alternatively in the water, but this was not that type of breath. It was the same breath you or I breathe right now, as normal.

&gt;H: Underwater breathing, but being able to drown on the surface? This plane sounds odd.

&gt;T: It is, but I loved it. I kind of want to stay and care for it, bring it to it's full potential. 

&gt;F: â€¦ I thought I was the only one that wished to do that?

&gt;T: Really? I thought the exact same thing.

&gt;H: Well then, it looks like I know what plane will be remembered the most. 

&gt;F: No one else could have summarized it so easily, Haming.

&gt;H: I appreciate the comment, Fast. Are you alright though?

&gt;F: â€¦ I'm fine. Ask the oaf next to me.

&gt;T: Malacath, can't you give me a hand here?

&gt;H: So, you went up to a peak, then went down into a valley with an extremely clear river. The rings were needed above the water, but not below. And there was plant life at the bottom, but nowhere else?

&gt;T: Pretty much. Just us, the water, and plants that looked like they were about to hug us.

&gt;H: And after what happened to Geldis, you didn't think to get out? Or at least show some form of caution?

&gt;F: There was an odd feeling with these plants, one that instinctively made us know that this was truly not harmful. Besides, we didn't get any plant life stuck up ourselves, did we?

&gt;H: Certainly not. Is there anything else?

&gt;T: I do not believe so, Haming. Let's get out of this room, I need to make sure the engines are ready.

&gt;F: And I need to make sure the course is set properly.

&gt;H: Great, let's get into our positions.
