|A Moth Priest attempts to recall the memories of a fellow Priest that reached Zero Sum using the same Elder Scroll used.|

*{A cryptic note left upon a desk in a Ayleid ruin within Cyrodiil, written in what looks disturbingly like blood. Large blotches make it uncomprehend-able in certain places, particularly towards the end. An Elder Scroll rests upon the floor.}*

SCRIBE: The note is intelligible gibberish, but I’ll add it to the report.

MOTH PRIEST: Good. Continue your writings.

SCRIBE: As you say.

MOTH PRIEST (TURNS): Give me the scroll, young man. **[NUMINIT]** was able to divine a certain series of events from it that might inform us what happened here.

PENITUS OCULATAS AGENT: Sorry priest, all ethereal devices are supposed to be delivered directly to the Elder Council.

*{Moth Priest draws a letter from a pocket and hands it to the Agent. The Agent reads it, and hands it back to the man.}*

AGENT (EMBARRASSED): My apologies sir, you should’ve told me that you had the Emperor’s wish–

MOTH PRIEST: Hush, child, such things are not needed to be told. Only observed. Now, if you would kindly hand me the scroll.

*{Agent hands over the scroll, and the Moth Priest takes it politely and holds it with both hands by both ends}*

MOTH PRIEST (GRANDLY): Akatosh, grant me the light to let me see what **[NUMINIT]** saw before he was ripped from our world. Pray I can call upon his memories to see what he could see, in the name of the Emperor.

{The Moth Priest looks at the Scribe, who is standing in the shadows.}

MOTH PRIEST: Please try to transcribe what I may or may not possibly say.

SCRIBE: Yes, priest.

*{Moth Priest opens the Elder Scroll, and his corporeal form begins to shake uncontrollably as the scroll floats in the air in front of him. Moth Priest’s eyes disintegrate as he speaks.}*

**[AKATOSH NOT FRAG, DUST IN THE ECHOES. IN THE DAWN ERA THE PERCH IS BROKEN, TIME CANNOT SUSTAIN WHAT IT CANNOT BE BUT IS. SEE THE FRAGMENTS AND LEARN THE DAY. ALDUIN IS FIRST, AND HE DESTROYS. AURI-EL IS SECOND, AND HE PERFORMS. ALKOSH IS THIRD, AND HE PROTECTS. SEE THE CONTEXT, TUSK NOT YET COMPLETE. PERYITE IS LAST, AND HE ORDERS. DRINK THE LIES AND EAT THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH IS LIES. TIME IS NOT A CIRCLE; TIME IS LINES, BROKEN. AKATOSH IS THE LARGEST BREAK. BREAK THE STITCHED AND REMAKE THE PIECES. (TIME FLOWS AND FLOWS AND FLOWS…) REMAKE THE PIECES AND RESTORE THE ONE. BRING THE ONE FROM OBLIVION AND HE WILL RESURRECT WHAT IS NEEDED. (PERALKELUIN). MAKE IT WHOLE (END); MAKE IT WHOLE (ACT); MAKE IT WHOLE (SERVE); MAKE IT WHOLE (ORDER); MAKE IT WHOLE–]**

|Transcription ends abruptly as the Moth Priest zero sums. This piece, written by the surviving Agent and Scribe, who could not remember their full mission and it alongside the Elder Scroll delivered to the Elder Council, and later killed themselves two days later (the Agent slit her throat and the Scribe burned himself to death). Text examined, and later filed within the deepest fathoms of the Imperial Library. Request ‘VOID’ upon order.|
