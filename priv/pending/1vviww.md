24th of Suns Height, 57th Year of the Third.

 This morning I awoke in a deep sweat with unknown pasts coursing through my mind, what kind of demon Mer magic this is I do not know, but I must outline all discoveries I come acrossed as a stipulation of my Imperial Charter. As of the 22nd of Suns Height my crew and I set sail from the shores of a Yokudan island of which we had been excavating some ancient Yokudan ruins.

The ruin itself is a vast warehouse seemingly constructed of a single piece of what I can only describe as Orcish metal only of a superior quality and shine despite its age and condition. Inside of this warehouse we discovered a large quantity of solid Nibenese bean shaped stones, flattened on the top and bottom, about the size of an average clay pot, and engraved with a single rune of unknown origin. I had the crew recover a number of these stones and return them to the camp. Nothing else remarkable was discovered in our year long excavations and once completed we began our journey back to the coast and our return to Tamriel.

Only two morning a sail and visions have haunted my dreams both nights. Perhaps the stone artifacts we recovered are of some form of ancient Yokudan earth magic, although to my chagrin I've  dreamnt of tan skinned mer, nigh hair, adorned in jewelry of brilliant gold and shining white, not of my proud ancestors. The dreams thus far have been cryptic but with each night have grown more alive. I've dreamnt of an old mer, very old and solemn in a deep meditation seldom seen, swathed in brown robes sitting upon a glorious throne though Orcish in its scant adornments. The mer trys to speak to me but I hear nothing, and then a visage of tall tower, built of gleaming brown metal in the shape of a longsword with the setting sun cut across its apex. Then visions of Yoku and mer children holding hands in the streets, running and playing silly games and mischeif. Then the last vision is see is of that same mer, only his features have grown younger and he has..... crystalized upon his throne and with a glimmer in his eye I awake from my dream, with a profound sadness and anger overcoming me.
