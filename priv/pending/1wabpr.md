Hello all,



In this post, I’m going to attempt to tackle the [Magne-Ge Pantheon](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/magne-ge-pantheon), and its potential interpretations within the [AkaLorkh = Spacetime](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1w616i/akalorkh_as_spacetime_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/) framework. This is quite long, so bear with me.


# A few preliminary comments

**CMYKBlend Signs**: These are clearly a direct reference to the [subtractive colors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color). I strongly suspect that the Blend Sign acts as the admixing action-frequency. In our universe, for example, purple does not have a single wavelength associated with it: a cyan-magenta-blend would be required to represent it, and your brain makes up the resulting averaged color you see. This is most likely why the Blends are distinct and "on the rise." Additionally, the context and nomenclature strongly remind me of the [standard stellar spectral classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Spectral_Classification_System#Harvard_spectral_classification) in Astrophysics, which relates a star's visible color to its surface temperature.


**Dualities**: We can think of Mundus and Aetherius as being equivalent and symmetric, with all the information of one side giving us all the information on the other side, albeit in a scrambled or 'rotated' form. The remnants of the Magne-Ge are the light filtering in from Aetherius through the white holes ripped at the boundary event horizon. See my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1w616i/akalorkh_as_spacetime_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/) and this [comment thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1w3qni/the_aurbis_spacetime_and_general_relativity/ceyq0wa) for more details.


**Redshift**: In our universe, redshifting comes from three main sources:


- [(Relativistic)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Doppler_effect) [Motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) (the Aurbic dance of precession, orbit, and spinning)


- [Gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_redshift) (embodied by Y'ffre's Mass Earthbone on Nirn)


- [Spacetime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift#Expansion_of_space) itself (embodied by AkaLorkh)

Redshifting entails decreasing all frequencies towards the red side of the light spectrum, or towards the lower notes of the musical scale. Within a quantum theory, a redshifted wave has less energy, but this probably best left to another post. Blueshifting is the opposite notion.


# Implications


The CMYKs can be associated with distinct spectral [eigenfrequencies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenfrequency#Applications); that is to say, they each have their own [unique, color signature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_spectrum#Origins). Thus, we can think of them as the Discrete/Digital components of Color: every other Color we can ever achieve can be obtained by Blending them appropriately. The Magne-Ge can then be thought of the [quantized, resonant frequencies of the Dreamer's mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonant_cavity#Cavity_resonators).


The et'Ada are the Analogs compositions of Color in Mundus^1: their spectral frequencies can be explained in terms of combinations of the Magne-Ge. However, by the duality of Aetherius and Mundus, we can think of the Magne-Ge as composed of et'Ada: they are both equivalent [eigenbases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenbasis#Eigenbasis). Mathematically, we can describe how to go from the Magne-Ge to the et'Ada through a [Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform), which decomposes a wave into its constituents. As above, so below ~ as within, so without.


Furthermore, I’d like to propose a revision to /u/myrrlyn’s [Musical, Colorful Aurbis](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1p1fip/aurbis_2_colorful_boogaloo/) post: the colors and Hue angles would be represented by some appropriate, correlated, combination of the Magna-Ge (one of the conjectures below outlines this). In fact, as would be expected from a synesthetic viewpoint, we could expect the et’Ada and Magna-Ge to fuse and mix; this is also further expounded in some of the conjectures. As a final note, the original [Aurbis: The Musical](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1oybze/aurbis_the_musical/) post’s comments on Lorkhan’s involvement with the Rhythm/Time can be neatly explained by the AkaLorkh as Spacetime.


In my mind, most of the above is fairly well-grounded; feel free to rip it apart as necessary. 


# Conjectures

What follows are the main conjectures I'd like to throw out there as food for thought:


1. **Color Duality**: The duality between Aetherius and Mundus, along with the association between the subtractive color wheel and the Magne-Ge leads to the natural idea that the (D)Aedra are associated with the [additive colors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_colors). Comparing the two color wheels leads to the inversion duality between the inside and outside of the boundary event horizon.


2. **The Spectral Equation**: As an extension of the above notion, 1 Blend Sign + 2 distinct, non-Blend Color Signs = {Magne-Ge Triplet} ~&gt; Enantiomorph ~&gt; 1 (D)Aedric dual in Mundus. We have 4 Blend signs total, which leads to 384 unique triplets of Magne-Ge. When combined with the Enantiomorph ordering, that leaves us with 2,304 distinct (D)Aedra^2. Note that this kind of decomposition lets us describe all aspects of the (D)Aedra as attributed by Nirnian cultures. For example, my head canon claims: *Scintil (Blend as Witness) + Thermallélé (K as Rebel) + Wode-Rub (C as King) = Lorkhan*.
Furthermore, this equation would ideally state how a given et'Ada relates to a Birthsign, and how its constituent Magne-Ge relate to stellar positions in the Birthsign.^3 Additionally, most of the Khajiiti pantheon would involve the Caker King (Blend). Please feel free to list any further decompositional equations you might think of below.


3. **Lorkhan anticipated the Breaking**: Since the star/tears left Magne-Ge as we provide a constant source of magicka/light/creatia to Mundus, I strongly believe it was part of Lorkhan's plan all along to have the Magne-Ge escape to allow the perpetual stream of Aetherial creative energy to soak into the Nirn. Perhaps this energy provides an active role that the (dead) Aedra could never have filled post-Breaking.


4. **et'Adic Echoes**: The et'Ada frequently revered on Nirn are really nothing more than the semi-comatose, echo-manifestations of congealed light from the Magne-Ge...these filtered clumps of light are redshifted(!) by Nirn's gravity, decreasing its strength and distorting its content, but still allows the inhabitants of Nirn to feel its effects.


5. **Breaking Shattered Magne-Ge**: The Magne-Ge, like the Aedra, are in death-sleep. The Breaking of the boundary event horizon between Mundus and Aetherius annihilated them, but the creatia/energy that streamed through revived their mirror-echo selves and their (D)Aedric counterparts.


# Open Questions


- **Redshift**: How does the stellar Dance relate to Redshift at the mythopoeic level? Is this what the Marukhati did when the Broke the Dragon?
- **The Serpent Birthsign**: How does it migrate and overtake other signs?
- **Other Pantheon proper nouns**: Is Nana Null equivalent to Nirn, the world beyond the event horizon? Are the Untime Folk complementary to the mortals of Nirn? Can [Chrome Box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrometer) decompose the Magne-Ge into et'Ada and vice-versa, like a Aurbical manifestation of a Fourier Transform?
- **Events**: Wtf are the Y Blur, War of C and M, and Thermal-Talk?
- **Color and Sound**: How do we split up the entire spectrum of Beings over their corresponding, intercorrelated sensory scales? Can the Magne-Ge Enantiomorphs be cast as Major/Minor Chords associated with each et’Ada?


I strongly suspect that most of these questions can be answered by a list breaking down each (D)Aedra into constituent et'Ada.


*****

1. Analog since they are hard-wired into Mundus.
2. Which is probably too many.
3. I have no idea how to make this work given the inconsistent graphical representations of the Birthsigns.

Big thanks to /u/laurelanthalasa for some discussion on these ideas!


~~I'll be away for the next few hours (yay for being back on my feet), but I'll be answering questions as soon as I get back. In the meantime,~~


I'm back! Feel free to fire away so that we might:
