Hey there all. So it seems to me that there is tons of talk around here about the nature and reason for Mundus. Why did Lorkhan trick the gods, what was his plan, the nature of CHIM and all that fun stuff. But what is never talked about is the reason, the *purpose* of the Dream. The one in Anu's head that we currently are in. Why did he/it create a new Dream? What was so wrong with the old one? Well let's take a look at the [Children's Annuad](http://uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:A_Children%27s_Anuad) or at least up until Anu goes into the sun. Why does he/it go into the sun, which is where the new Dream begins? He/It was grieving for the loss of Nir, the one that he/it loved. Anu created the current dream in order to recreate Nir. 

Now let's look at that word. Nir. Seems familiar. The only difference between it and Nirn is a little letter, n. We also see n in mathematics where it can stand for the power a number is raised too if that power is not defined. so for example 8^n could mean anything from 8^5 to 8^9846729284647. It is a place holder for an unknown number. Now think of Nirn not as Nirn but as Nir^n. This is why we have kalpas. They don't really fit into Lorkhan's grand plan anyway now do they? Ascending would be easier if mortals didn't have to keep starting over. But then again Lorkhan isn't the one who reverts time to Convention and begins a new kalpa now is he? It's Alduin, the great great grandson of Anu (well not really, but you know what I mean). And why? Because it wasn't right. Nirn that is. Each time it wasn't perfect, it was off somehow, it wasn't the Nir that Anu remembers and yearns for. So Alduin is tasked with taking out the trash and starting over. He got in trouble for not doing that and playing with it instead remember?

Now the Khajiit have Nirni in there story. In computer programming there is something called a loop that allows a line of code to be executed over and over again. Several of these use i in their code line in order to define parameters or number of iterations. Some of these loops can be programmed to continue running until certain characteristics are met. i is also used in summation in order to stand in for a series of data that need to be added. In this sense it is again a stand in for an unknown value, Nir to the what?

I hope I have made my thought process clear and I would welcome anyone with a better knowledge of programming to help explain this and I can edit appropriately. As always thank you for taking the time to read and I welcome any and all criticism and remarks so that I may cut myself into a better shape.
