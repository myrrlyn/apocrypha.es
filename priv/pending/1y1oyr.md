The Archive of Thot is a temple in northern Valenwood which has befuddled many scholars over the years in which it has existed; those being 5E 1 to Now.

The temple is simple, Ayleid in design, and contains naught but one thot terminal, containing thousands of well known childhood tales in thotmolds, which are stored in a cavernous room under the ground.

While most people report experiencing tales without any difference to those available through Dreamsleeve, some report odd discrepancies and occasionally vastly different plot lines and perspectives. In either case, these thotmolds are unusual because they do not perfectly tailor their storytelling to their observer's mind.

It appears that they were permanently imprinted with the mind of their first observer. Attempts at identifying this first observer have been entirely fruitless due to unexplained corruption of data and spontaneous equipment failure.
