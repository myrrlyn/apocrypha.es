The hammer of the Doom Drum beat-beats, beat-beats. Black, Boet blood bleeds from the starry heart-shaped hole. Vehk and Vehk lie safely beyond. The king's Razor maw is drawn into the death grin that ate even himself. Wind escapes as a whisper of the seven hidden liberations. Highborn kinsman come to bear away their stolen treasure. Kyne's widow-wail carries unwish unto the mountain range. The void ghost calls out from behind the moon-shadow, "I am Not! There, I did not die!"

[I've been reading lots of good lore lately, leading up to C0DA. It was quite the ride and I was urged to toss up a submission based on some poetry I've been reading. It's out of my chest now, so please compliment, criticize, or contribute.]
