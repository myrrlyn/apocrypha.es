A Redguard folk story, a bit experimental for me. Please tell me what you think.

____

There was in the old times a daughter of a great *tomba*, whose name is lost to time. She was called Mirhj'Taea, and she had the sun in her heart and her *hai*. Those who did not know her would say she was the daughter of *Al-Tomba M'noga*, an architect of renown who had many children without ever taking a wife. And she was, but she had a streak of her own choosing, and she liked to visit the other *tombas* that M'noga did not like, and she liked to venture out and explore. She climbed over mountains and into caves, across plains and through forests, for what good were two legs if one did not walk and what good were two eyes if one did not see, and what good was the sun if one could not catch each and every ray where it came to warm the earth?

M'noga found her one day when she came back from her walk and said, "Mirhj'Taea, why will you not stay still? Your brothers and sisters and I like to walk, but we walk together, and this way we are not lost."

"But Father," Mirhj'Taea implored, "I always have the sun above to guide me home."

"How do you know it will be here tomorrow?" M'noga said. "And how do you know we will be here tomorrow if you go for your walk and leave us as you like to do? The men to the east come asking for our young men to work on their house, and it is something that will go on until we are the bricks and not the builders. One of these days we will have to leave."

"Do not worry, Father, because I have my friends to tell me where you have gone if I miss you."

"You know I do not like those young men of the other *tombas*, Tresnimelaq and Somegerat. For the last time, please stay here with us."

With this, Mirhj'Taea became upset and ran out into the desert alone. She stayed there alone for three days, and on the third she began to miss home. So she walked all the way back, only to find her town vacant of all who had lived there. Realizing that she was alone, she sat in a chair in her former family's home and wept bitterly for a time, until all her tears were spent and she could think of finding her *tomba*. She was about to stand up, but suddenly the earth began to shake, and everything around her crumbled away, leaving a square of dirt, a chair, and Mirhj'Taea. Her home was usurped by the sea, and so she wept some more. 

When Tresnimelaq and Somgerat heard her crying, they got into a boat and paddled to the echo of her home to comfort her. "Will you take me to my *tomba*?" she pleaded.

"I have lost my *tomba* too," Tresnimalaq said, "and it is not so bad. you should stay here."

"The ocean is lovely, but it is the fish who ate your home. So you must catch all the fish you can if you want your home back," Somgerat said. Mirhj'Taea often did not know what he was talking of, but he comforted her just the same.

"Thank you," she said. "I will stay here and catch fish for a while, but one day I must try to leave again." And she did stay and fish for a time, until her longing returned; she tried to swim away until she remembered she could not, and she tried to fly away until she remembered she could not. She still sits on her echo-island, and when the children of the children of the children of M'noga sail by it, they wave sadly, full of pity for the fallen daughter.
