Landfall: Day 0 - Drunken Gods

4 hours and 6 bottles of brandy later Nerervar spills his goblet.  Seht’s mechanical laugh somehow makes the scene even funnier.  If not for his mechanical legs automatically balancing, he would have fallen over.

Nerervar mops up the drink with a cloth. “Get that ancient Dagoth brandy! If there’s a time to enjoy it, it’s right now.”

One of Seht’s fabricants quickly arrives bearing the beverage in its claws. 

“One for you ol’ Seht, and one for me.” The goblets filled, Nerervar dashes the bottle to the floor, scattering the rest across the ebony tiles. “and that’s for Vehk and Ayem.  Ur too, if there’s any left over!”  He/she laughs heartily, briefly losing control of this form.

Seht raised his goblet and clinked with Nerervar.  “To us and those who want to be like us”

The two gods downed their drinks.  Nerervar held the last gulp in his mouth for what felt like an eternity, savoring the flavor of houses and friends long gone.  Seht more methodically drained his goblet and went back to maintaining the timelines.

“Everything’s glowing” the Hortator smiled.

“It is” Seht replied.  “Interesting.”

It was true, not just a drunken hallucination.  Every enchanted item was glowing; as if being overcharged with magicka.  Nerervar’s sword is visible through its scabbard.  Even Wraithguard, its enchantments long faded, comes to life.  

A second sun has appeared in the sky. A new hole to Aetherius.  “That certainly explains the magicka surge” Nerervar mumbles. “Stop staring Seht, your eyes are bleeding.”

Seht clucks, wiping away the blood.  “Is that your sign Nerervarine?”  A bronze finger points to a fiery point of light streaking across the sky.

“It is dear Sotha Sil.”   He stands on legs no longer uncertain.  “Calculate its impact.  Then send a memospore to Actual.  The Dwarves have returned.”

A curiously monotone voice booms throughout the CItadel.  

TRAJECTORY CALCULATED - IMPACT CYRODILL - IMPERIAL CITY

The Citadel shakes as the gears deep beneath whir furiously.

Landfall: Day 0 - Imperial City - Weirship

“Memospore incoming commander!”

“What’s the word?” Thalm(or) commander Drel shouts; buckling his armor.

“It’s Sotha Sil Sir!  I’m putting it on the Tok-box now.”

NUMIDIUM IMPACT IMMINENT - LANDFALL EXPECTED T MINUS 6 HOURS - GATHER YOUR MER - INITIATE LAUNCH FOR SECUNDA BASE OR FACE WORLD REFUSAL - THE GODS ARE WITH YOU

“Blast, I was hoping those prophesies the Nerervarine spouted were Guar-shit.  Well don’t just stand there; get the transports loaded!”

Drel pauses, looking through the crystalized sunlight that formed the windows of the Weirship.  Gleaming brass from the Numidium’s armored shell was visible even at this distance.  “This is going to be Alinor all over again. Maybe the lessons we learned in our greatest tragedy will help now.”

He turns, for a moment looking resplendent in his golden armor and snow-white hair.  “Airmer Llervu! Scramble Ghost Choir squadrons 1 through 10.  The rest on reserve.”

Landfall: Day 0 - Citadel Assembly Room

Nerervar sits in the head of Akulakhan behind its third eye. He/she is flickering. 

“Here’s your chance Seht!  Witness the birth of a god!” (a silly notion considering he was present for the birth of at least 3).

Sotha Sil looks up from the floor. The voice does not come from his mouth.

THE ELDER SCROLL EXISTS OUTSIDE OF TIME AND SPACE - IT SHOULD BE BEYOND THE NUMIDIUM’S TIME DISTORTIONS

[NUMINIT] flips the first of a bank of switches.  Far above the roof slowly separates and opens. 

“My dear estranged wife. Shall we consider this our reconciliation?  Or is this a divorce decree?”

The second switch is flipped. Energy from Azura’s Star surges through the body of the second Numidium. Its eyes flicker briefly before settling on a solid red glow.

Nerervar would deny this to this day, but at that instant he heard the tortured scream of Ayem; her soul mangled and metamorphosed into something...new.
 
Switch three. The Scroll Matrix comes online. To a mortal observer, Akulakhan would seem to briefly fade somehow, returning with ever more THERENESS.  

The modified Corpus-spreaders began to emit [uncolor] energy with the next switch.
 
Nerervar tentatively twists and turns, flexing Akulakhan’s arms and legs.  “Alright you sons of bitches, refuse this!”

Akulakhan leaps straight up, assisted by jets mounted on its back. Nerervar had made some improvements.

The colossal being lands on the island pausing only briefly to get their bearings before leaping SouthWest towards the Imperial City. Towards Numidium.
