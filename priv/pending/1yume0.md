Anumidium reeled backwards from Akulakhan's prepared blow, while Akulakhan was forced to step back due to the force of Anumidum's fist. Anumidium lunged at Akulakhan, and caught the second robot around the waist. Akulakhan punched Anumidium, but the Walking Tower ignored the blow, stood up lifting Akulakhan over its head, and threw Akulakhan. Akulakhan smashed into the ground and skidded, crushing a farm and breaking a river as it did so. Water swelled and gushed around its feet as it stood up.

Anumidium did not take pause in its assault, growing in size and picking up a mountain. Magma started pushing on the ground beneath where the mountain was once rooted, and the earth shook. Anumidium heaved the mountain at Akulakhan, and then started running behind it, a brass fist raised.

Blue lights surrounded Akulakhan's right arm, and the mountain blew up mid flight; a massive shockwave shook birds from trees across the seas, and through the dust cloud half a country wide, Anumidium's fist flew through toward Akulakhan. Akulakhan swung it's left fist in an uppercut, nailing the Brass Tower in the jaw just as it was hit in the chest. Akulakhan fell on its back onto the ground as Anumidium was thrown into the air.

**NO**

Akulakhan fell on its back onto the ground as Anumidium stood above it. Anumidium planted one of its feet ontop of Akulakhan and jumped with the other foot so as to land full weight ontop of Akulakhan. Within the head of Akulakhan, the Neveravine closed his eyes. His demigod robot tripled in size. Anumidium was toppled by the size change of the robot beneath it, and the Brass God fell into a forest, flattening it.

Over in what was once Skyrim, Anumidium and Akulakhan each held a mountain and swung at each other. The mountains collided and burst. Both of the robots continued running through the rocks toward each other, ready to grapple. Akulakhan tripped over the river Windhelm claimed as defense, and slammed into Anumidium. The robots fell south, and landed, one on top of the other, in the middle of the hotspring-riddled Eastmarch. 

Steam erupted around them, water hotter than possible rushed up to envelope the two of them. With a rumbling louder than Alduin's world-hungry roar, lava pushed up from the ground. Anumidium, beneath Akulakhan, was thrust deep into it, while Akulakhan struggled to get away from the erupting supervolcano. A brass arm reached through the rushing ash and grabbed onto Akulakhan's wrist.

The trees of Valenwood burned. A little Akulakhan and a little Anumidium zipped between them, firing blasts of lightning and steam at each other. A nozzle popped out from Akulakhan's chest, and sprayed oil into the air, and Anumidium was caught in the spray. A burst of lightning smote the miniature Brass God in the chest, and Anumidium went up in flames. Anumidium picked up a deer, and as it caught fire, threw the animal at Akulakhan. Akulakhan swatted the flaming deer away as the Nerevarine within exhaled with impatience and displeasure. She cursed Anumidium and blasted it once more with lightning.

Back where the Akulakhan had tripled in size, it stomped Anumidium into the ground. It stomped again. The Anumidium grew further, and grabbed the giant foot when the foot raised.

**NO**

Anumidium was standing and threw the colossal Akulakhan to the ground. As it's head rushed through the clouds, Nerevarine caused it grow smaller. She watched through the eyes of Akulakhan as more battles erupted into being, as Time was shredded. In the sky the robots fought, with fists and blue lights. On smoking Red Mountain, ash clouds surrounded an Anumidium as an Akulakhan wrapped its tentacles around the Brass God's neck. Over to the west and in the sea, two giant mechas fashioned swords out of rising waves and beat into each other.

*Nerevarine Nerevarine Nereravine Nerevarine Nerevarine Nereravine Nerevarine Nerevarine Nereravine*

The minds met in the Godplace. Each one was lost in feedback, as mental pressures compounded with each other and sensations overlapped. No Nerevarine was a Nerevarine unto themselves as themselves, no thing was separate and the mere possibility of being otherwise was fading. On the brink of Zero-Sum, a voice cried out, "Seht!"

With a word in a language that will never exist because its possibility negates the validation of negation, Seht set things right, but for a moment. In the Godplace, a moment was an eternity, and Nerevarine was safe. Sane. Secure.

With new resolve the battles continued. Two of the pairs of demigods had appeared close to each other, and the Akulakhans held hands. Creating a feedback loop between them, they powered up an attack and focused on one of the Anumidiums before them, which was lost in white light. The other Anumidium angrily reached over and grabbed the two sides of the power loop, and brought them together. The resulting explosion erased that land from existence. The very air there caught fire. 

There was a noise like a clock the size of a moon ticking. The air-on-fire swirled into a tornado and faded out of existence. Where the land had been destroyed, was no melted crust, but glowing gears moving. Blue light shimmered from the location.

The other battles continued unabated. An Akulakhan that had no set form but shifted, turned into a ball and surrounded its Anumidium. Within, multitudes of Corpus beasts threw themselves at the contained Anumidium, which crushed them against the very walls of its prison. There was an Akulakhan with seven pairs of arms casting spells at its Anumidium, which shrugged them off in its walk to rip those arms off. Three of the arms were already laying behind it. Multi-coloured lights flashed in the sky, beams of energy occasionally aimed at the earth and scorching it. 

A sound like crystal cracking was in every ear, and the Greymarch came from the sky. Jyggalag hovered at the front of his armies, and he shouted with a manic fury,

"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!" 

The crystalline daedra fell upon the nearest Anumidiums, fighting not to conquer the Brass Gods, but to distract and reposition them so that the respective Akulakhans could defeat the Dwemer Skinned Towers. Jyggalag cared not for such precision and smacked the nearest Anumidium furiously with the flat side of his sword.

"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!" he raged again, beating the Anumidium down. 

"IT'S ALL BROKEN!" Jyggalag roared, white froth dripping from his helmet, before tossing his sword to the side and mounting the figure beneath him as his armour melted away.

**NO**

The Anumidiums were free and more than one Akulakhan fell when their crystalline helpers disappeared. Jyggalag was not.

"Vehk!" cried one of the Nerevarines, as their Akulakhan was torn into two at the waist. The two-toned Goddess appeared in the sky, and slung Muatra at the offending Anumidium. The Brass God saw and jumped to avoid it, but Muatra caught its legs. The two robot torsos clawed their way to each other as Vivec turned to interfere with another battle. 

The seasons were changing around the two demigods. The present Akulakhan was standing still, vibrating so fast light bounced off all of its locations. The Anumidium was attempting to punch its way through an ever redoubling wall of sound. Vivec formed his Muatra into a spear, and threw it at the Anumidium. The Brass God knew, and turned around and stretched out an arm to catch Muatra. Muatra pierced it's skin, and the arm was shattered. A word formed in Anumidium's mind as Muatra reached it's chest,

**NO**

but Vehk and Vehk was gone before the word was done. The whole Anumidium turned again to the wall of sound.

A young Nerevarine called out for its mother, and Ayem came. She called for her husband, and the ground beneath the fighting robots disappeared. They fought now on rotating cogs, which separated the two. Ayem reached into a star and pulled out a darkness and cast it on the Anumidium; when the darkness touched the golden cog beneath it, a brightness erupted from it, and the Anumidium was smothered. Brass spikes erupted from the Void Bag, and Ayem disappeared before she could be punctured. The young Nerevarine directed their Akulakhan at the Void Bag as the Brass Tower struggled within, and grabbed it. Both were smashed into nothingness between gears as Akulakhan pulled the trapped Anumidium into the Clockwork.

The heat from the erupting volcanos, from the fires, from the lasers, enveloped the world. In Atmora, ice started to drip from the beards of frozen Kings. As their hearts started to beat, their eyes started to move. They witnessed a fight between two giants, and as one, they opened their mouths.

A shout of shouts tossed both of the giant demigods to the ground and both were in pieces. As Man became a possibility again and Man became again TALOS appeared in the sky, horns blew from all directions and

***NO***
