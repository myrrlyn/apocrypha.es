"RELEASE THE BEAST AND THE MER AND NO PAIN WILL FALL UPON YOU, NUMIDIUM!" the Nerevarine said, their voice loud and fractured within the body of another Giant, this one made of flesh and bone.

"Who is he calling a beast, the arrogant–" the Argonian prepared to say when the hand of Numidium released him and he and his companion fell past the Non-Air towards the Shifting Ground.

Suddenly there was a rush of wind and the two companions landed without sound upon the deck of a Voidship, steaming from falling through the fabric of the seam. The Argonian choked; he was now old. His companion, however, looked even younger.

"On your feet, creatures. Let the two fight it out without interference." This voice came from a Nord, a diagonal cut across his entire face constantly disappeared and reappeared due to the death of the End of Time. "I am Captain Grem the Frozen, Captain of the Voidship *Dibella's Corset*. Do you have papers?!"

"What, papers?" the Boiche asked, her voice childish but deep. Grem the Frozen walked across the deck for an eternity to fast, causing dust to swirl in a storm.

"Hm, I thought not. Quickly now, get below the deck mam. You sir, you don't look hurt. Grab the armaments."

"I don't fight." the Argonian said tersely.

"You listen to me you lizard and you listen good we are ALL fighting today, you here me? Especially those on my ship."

The Argonian stood there in the burning, dusty wind when the sound of the Two-But-Really-Just-One Numidium's battled in the background. A gust of wind delivered a snatch of dialogue that quickly winked from existence:

&gt;**HORTATOR.**

"WE ARE NEREVAR. AND WE ARE MANY."

Explosions light the day, ripping holes into pasts and removing historical figures from existence and placing them in places before their own time. But what is time now, if it doesn't even know its own name anymore?

"Fine, landstrider. Even if there is no more land to stride on."

"Good, now arm the can– wait, what by Shor is that?"

The crew looks around, looking for the source of the Captain's worry. And then they see it and now they worry too.

Out of the air, materializing like there was nothing there to begin with, walked an assortment of beings that should not be there but were. Beings that had not stood in the same area since before the Creation, and were standing there again to watch its demise.

"We swore this day would never happen," a sparkling light cried out towards Numidium, who stood still and unwavering. "But it has. We have return to this plane, and we destroy your rot before it breaks its bones."

**NO.**
