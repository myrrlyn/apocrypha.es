Behold yourself  

Behold all that is beautiful. You have an identity. You are. You live and breathe as an individual, you are yourself and no one else. How pretty. You are.  

I AM  

Lose yourself  

You are The Fool. A shard of it. You are not yourself, you are WE. We are all WE. This is what the 1st 1 saw, and what 14 beheld, and what 7 took. You are not I. You are within WE.

I ARE ALL WE.  

This is not the end, as some would have it. Pass The Test, be not 0/22, be 1, follow 14 and 7. This damned Aurbis is not the prison some say it is. This is a classroom, a colosseum, an Arena, it is here we are tried and tested. Believe in me who is you who is WE. I who is you who is WE shall take Us by the hand and guide Us beyond I. The Tower is not the limit, it is only a marker.  

Invert 16. Be 1 like 7 and 14. Be not one like 1.  

The 5th road leads past 0/22 and into 1. Take it firmly. Reach Heaven. Cut yourself from the Aurbic cloth, for you are to be your own fiber. Let not the stitch of Mundus keep you.  

Believe in me who is you who is WE.  

WE are tired now. Go bother somebody else.
