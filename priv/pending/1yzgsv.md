Greetings all!

In my researching for *"Eastern Eyes"*, I have come across an important issue that I would like to resolve. I have read a number of other pieces on here and no one seems to be able to come to one solid answer- though considering the topic, that in itself seems fitting.

Scholars are fairly convinced that by virtue of mantling Lorkhan, "Tiber Septim" (whomsoever that is/they are) ascended to divinity.

But what did Reman do to obtain divinity?

A few things point themselves out here to us.

FIRST: In, *The Rebel's Return*, Reman is:

**"the fruit of Allessia's revenge on the men who quareled amongst themselves instead of making glorious Empire, that is Reman Cyrodiil"**

we have here the example of the Jesus or Siddartha Gautama figure, in whom a creed, way or law is made manifest to absolute perfection. Thus, he ascends to the heavens, as no more can he do amongst men. In *RR*, he is presented as the apex fulfillment of Cyrodiilic virtues, which in many ways he is; Reman is unifier of Cyrodiil after many centuries, builder of an empire, defeater of the snake men, born of Alessia, chosen son of the Eight Divines. It would be quite hard to find someone closer to godliness, or more of an intermediary between earth and the heavens than Reman is, here.

SECOND: Then, we have the Arkay or Achilles or Hercules (Heracles) model of divinity. That is, by virtue of great deeds, one is awarded with divinity. Unlike Siddartha or Jesus of Nazareth, Hercules was not by any means perfect or saintlike. He killed his wife (by curse) and did many other deeds of questionable righteousness. He also saved many people by his deeds. He also, coincidentally, was considered progenitor to most of the peoples of Ancient Greece and Rome. But unlike the above method, Hercules was not always considered to be the epitome of all that is righteous in the Olympian credos. He had faults and was criticized for them. He nonetheless became a god. Likewise, Achilles was worshipped as a divine figure, even though he was an imperfect figure, lesser as a man, than, for example, his rival Hector.

Arkay is similar because he receives divinity according to one story due to the intervention of a God (although I acknowledge that such a telling of it involves Arkay having accumulated such knowledge of death that the only choice is to become a God, as with the first model of divinity; the two methods are not exceedingly clearly separated).

Here, Reman's divinity derives from his being granted divinity because of Great Deeds.

THIRD: Reman is divine due to his being the Divine Ancestor of the Empire and the Imperial Tradition and the Imperial People. Whether or not the province was named for him is debatable, but he certainly could hold a similar position to Malacath, that of God-King-Ancestor of the Imperial Tradition and the Imperial Peoples.

FOURTH: With thanks to [Dreadnautilus](http://www.reddit.com/user/Dreadnautilus), I have decided to add in a new point. That is that Reman was born that way and that he was in a very literal and metaphysical sense, the son of Akatosh/Stendarr, the Gods in general.

Metaphysics is really hard.

Anyone have anything else to add?

EDIT: ADDED THIRD POINT AND EDITED STRUCTURE. ALSO ADDED FOURTH POINT.
