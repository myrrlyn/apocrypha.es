*The following correspondence was recovered by Sevan Telendas, Legate of the Fourth Legion, who seems to be writing a history of the Fourth Era.
The Following letters were sent in 4E 200, shortly before the onset of the Dragon Crisis. They detail communication between the East Empire Company and a number of notable figures on Solstheim.*

*They were so interesting, I felt I simply had to collate them.*

*Intendant Bero, Penitus Oculatus*

Mogrul,

We are sending you and Slitter to review the state of various businesses and the Ebony Mines on Solstheim. Some blabbermouth in Raven Rock is insisting his business be purchased, and an old affiliate of the company has been persistently making noise about new Ebony. I leave it to you to establish the truth of the matter and continue to ensure our interests are observed with discretion.

Regards,

Vittoria Vici

Modyn,

I didn’t think this Skeeverhole of an island was worth a damn until yesterday. Then, one of my sources goes and blows his mouth off, and lo and behold, I found out that my old buddy Tribune Modyn Veleth is the captain of the Redoran Guard! I haven’t seen you since…well, it must have been since discharge, after the restoration in Markarth. Slitter and I have come across some real ripe opportunities. Come see me if you’re interested in making some *real* coin instead of wandering about playing soldier. I was sick of that after Red Ring.

Mogrul.

“Mogrul”,

I don’t have a clue where that stupid Greenskin name comes from, or why you’re calling yourself that nowadays, but stay away from me and mine. I told you and Slitter I never wanted to see you again. What you two pulled in Markarth…Just stay bloody well clear of me and mine, or I’ll carve out your hearts with a spoon.

Veleth.

Veleth,

Dear me! Hostility. Well, I can even use that. But fear not. We’ll stay clear.

For now.

Mogrul

PS. Slitter says your woman looks nice.

Dear Councilor Morvayn,

I regret to inform you that the men the East Empire Trading Company sent here are not merely here to negotiate a better price for food shipments. They are former legionnaires I served with in the Great War. They were also part of the contingents sent to Markarth after the restoration. They have committed no criminal offences against Great House Law, nor have they any Imperial Criminal Records, but were discharged in “controversial circumstances” after Markarth. I am posting Redoran guards nearby to keep watch over them. I have a strong suspicion they are also engaged in illicit money lending, but as yet have no proof.

With deepest respect,

Modyn Veleth, Captain of the Redoran Guard

Dear Miss Vici,

I do not know if you remember me, but I remember you very well. I have visited the Imperial City and Solitude many, many times, and indeed, saw you perform your harp piece at the Empress Morihatha Opera House, when you were but a child. My name is Lleril Morvayn, and I and my mother were once some of your company’s greatest partisans.

That is, of course, until our Ebony ran dry. At that point, your company decided to pack up and leave Solstheim, leaving the townsfolk of Raven Rock, who had labored for years to help ship your- no, I apologize- our Ebony across Tamriel, without decent shipping and low on food. Now you add insult to the egregious injury you have done to Raven Rock. My security staff has assured me that you have sent a couple of thugs to conduct your corporate backstabbing in my town.

I await your explanation,

Regards,

Lleril Morvayn

Vendil,

I want further background checks on Mogrul and Slitter. It turns out you were right. I was aware they were almost certainly hiding skeletons in their proverbial closets, but, thank the divines for Lleril Morvayn’s typical bluster, it has come to my attention that these two may not be entirely who they purport to be. We expect this dealt with discreetly and at an appropriate distance.

Vittoria.

Vittoria,

Done. I’ll see you at the wedding. I’m sure you are already glowing, and that the reception will be to die for.

Vendil.

Councilor Arano,

It has come to the attention of the Redoran Councilors that our dear Lleril has been engaged in harassment of the Imperial Princess Vittoria Vici. This will cease, posthaste. A new vein was just discovered at the Dunmeth straight, west of Blacklight, and another near Suran. The last thing we need is Morvayn’s idiocy ruining the profits of this Great House. We sent you to guard not only Morvayn’s life, but also to ensure his tongue is guarded. A replacement for First Councilor Morvayn can be found easily enough; if you won’t take the position, others can. Lleril isn’t as universally loved as you islanders like to think. Consider this a formal warning from House Redoran.
