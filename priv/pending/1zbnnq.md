The Sword-Singers have long spoken to the imagination of the population of Tamriel, and it is this sentiment that makes it hard for us to see that Sword-Singers were once a real facet of Yokudan culture. While still revered as excellent swordsmen, they were also a rather common sight in the bigger cities.

While the common image of Sword-Singers is the old hermit, practising his techniques alone, or in his temple, with his Shehai, or Spirit-Sword, only showing his face to combat evil. While a good base for folklore and children stories, this notion is mostly false. While every Sword-Singer had to undergo the Walkabout to be considered an adult member, this was not the focus of their existence.  
Indeed, experience was key for a successful Sword-Singer, as memorising the different stances, holds, and movements was what gave them their combat prowess. To achieve such solid grasp on their martial art, most Sword-Singers would employ themselves as mercenaries, or take on more relaxing jobs as bodyguards. This did not only make it possible for the members to make a living, but also to fund the Halls of the Virtues of War, which were unable to operate purely on gifts. This did not mean that the Sword-Singers would only come out when the pay was right. Under the laws of Frandar Hunding (and possibly before, seeing the age of the order), correcting wrongs was the essential purpose of the Sword-Singers. In times of ideological wars (like during the time of Frandar and Daved Hunding) they would form a front against those they would deem evil.

That is not to say that all Sword-Singers would appear solely on the battlefield. In Yokudan culture artisanry in the martial arts was very important, and it was not uncommon to have swordsmen and -women show their skills in public, in the form of 'kata's' and duels. A Sword-Singer, with their superior skill and endurance, would be a great attraction. These artisans would earn enough with their performances to be able to support a family. With the rarity of Sword-Singers, a performing one would be a family's day out.

With the destruction of Yokuda, the flight to Hammerfell, and the Imperialisation of Hammerfell, the Sword-Singers became a dying breed. It is most likely that the 'hermit sword-sorcerer' idea stems. With the focus of Tamrielic warfare on numbers instead of skills, the Sword-Singers were deemed obsolete, and their role in Redguard culture was diminished to that of folklore. Currently, the Sword-Singers have all but disappeared from the cities of Hammerfell, as well as their historic respect for artisanry. With these changes, the true role of these fabled warriors was covered with the dust and stones of myth and folklore.
