“Lorkhan” at that moment saw existence much as a Dwemer sees existence, something that is describable in reasonable terms and therefore able to be manipulated to their whim.  He had seen the something, or the maybe that he came from, and then saw the nothing that was outside of it.  It is therefore ironic that a supposed god and that god’s followers would be able to reason more than my fellow Dwemer.  It is understandable though.  As our scientists pierced into the heart of said “god” and saw the void, everything we have stood for since we began keeping record has come undone.  Our belief that everything is describable through reason is contradicted by the fact that reality isn’t real.  Perhaps we Dwemer have come to the point which other races had reached before us; not knowing what to make of the world around us and thus creating elaborate fictions to describe reality.  Our race’s most recent elaborate fiction is that we are not, since everything is not.  This, though an anti-thesis to the beliefs of the superstitious, is itself almost as ignorant a belief and just as dangerous as the cults that surround us.

The goal of our recent great endeavor, is to bring our race back to the beginning, and this is a grand idea with a decent amount of reason and research to back it up, but a decent amount of research just doesn’t do the job.  You cannot forge a masterpiece of armor or a nearly flawless hammer made of our metal with the metallurgic knowledge of one of the lesser races.  This is exactly what Dwemer like Kagrenac are doing, attempting to build a divine suit of armor using nearly divine tools with the “metallurgic” knowledge of a Dwemer.  Though we as a race like to boast, we are not yet knowledgeable enough in the ways of the “divine” to actually achieve something akin to divinity.  We haven’t even carried our own thought process through almost to the end like “Lorkhan” supposedly did in the tale of before creation.  “Lorkhan” succeeded in forging a new creation out of his inherently Dwemer thought process, and I fear our potential creation will fail to be as stable as the one he supposedly created.

Imagine a giant suit of armor, worn by the entire Dwemer race, with the belief of the “we are not” cult.  It would be an ignorant religious fanatic with the power of a god, something worse than the Daedra and Aedra.  If this “god” mantled by our entire race were to use this dangerous belief with divine powers, it could do to Mundus what the first discovery of the nothing did to our belief in reason, unravel it until it is but a husk of what it once was.  I propose that instead of going forward with our plan to mantle this colossus with our current knowledge, we devote time to learning more about the main power source of it, and indeed, the colossus it used to inhabit.  I and my colleagues have spent numerous years studying this, regrettably in secret due to it’s controversy, but there is yet much to be discovered.  We know what thought process “Lorkhan” had that supposedly enabled him to continue to be in the presence of nothing and then create another state of being, but we still know not what triggered the thought in the first place, nor what the full implications of said thought would be.  I request more research to be done on this topic before we continue.

Furthermore, I implore Kagrenac, who is wise, and has a dedication to the Dwemeri unseen in many others, to not go through with his plan to create the Numidium without further study.  If you truly want what is best for your people, do not let them mantle a new “god” until this cult-like belief in the “we are not” dies down, for the sake of the Dwemer people.  We could potentially undo ourselves and no longer be the bastion of reason Mundus so desperately needs.
