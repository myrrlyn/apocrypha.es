*[Author’s Note: The following story was loosely translated from an ancient Nordic tomb recently excavated in Skyrim. The tomb, known simply as Nahlotod (“Silenced Snow”), was found near the ruins of the once beautiful city of Snowhawk. Interestingly, this tomb did not contain the Nordic dead known as draugr and had only one sarcophagus chained shut and suspended from the ceiling over an ashy pit. Unfortunately, Nahlotod collapsed only days after we were able to retrieve several artifacts from it, including the sarcophagus. This story was one such artifact.]*

#The Hanging of the Renegade
[It was in darkened times] that the mighty dovah Vokunmahfass looked down from the [Throat?] and saw the wounded child of snow walking through the frost, blood dripping from his chin and seeping into the earth. The child was already dead, his past [unknown and finished], and so Vokunmahfass leaped down from the Throat to claim his life as his own, and satisfy his hunger.

Where the dovah flew darkness billowed, and as he prepared to snap up the child he realized that another quarry had reached his [prey?]. A pack of Grohiik, wolves. He pulled up, realizing that he was now the spectator in a great feasting.

He was greatly surprised instead. The Kiir was attacked by the wolves, but held his ground and struck back. In his hand the [knife?] gleamed, and continued to shine as it dug into the neck of a Grohiik, and its laas drained away. The other creatures attacked, but the Jul struck with a nah so fierce, and they each fell to his [tuz.]

On that day, Vokunmahfass saw the makings of a [dovah], in a mere Joor.

Landing with the sound of power, Vokunmahfass spoke to the boy, intrigued.

“Drem Yol Lok, Kiir. Greetings. Your ziil is Joor, but your zii – your spirit – is Dovah. Tell me your name.”

“I have no [name]. I [cast that off of me long ago] and I do not need one.”

At that, Vokunmahfass laughed. “Your heart is like fo, which you withstand, and your mind blazes with yol. I name thee Iizyoldein, and I make you Sonaan!”

With the utterance of those words, Vokunmahfass grabbed Iizyoldein and carried him to the Throat on the gentle breathes of [Kaan?], where he taught him the way of the Dovah and his own [Zul], and the thu’um.

With these teachings, Iizyoldein grew from Kiir to Jul, and his [power?] became legendary. Nowhere else in Keizaal did one have such [control and mastery] of the talents of the Iizyol, the thu’um of combined frost and flame.

But nowhere else either was there a Joor who was ruled with such bruniik. His city of Bo Od, dedicated to his lady Kaan, ran red with [sos?] from the toil of its villagers. Iizyoldein turned those that displeased into iiznus – ice statues – and buried them alive in pits of fire. He ruled with fear, and eventually his power became to threaten those of the other Sonaan and [they] hunted him.

Enraged, Iizyoldein screamed a strun of Iizyol around his small [Junaar], and his enemies found themselves unable to cross the barrier, his thu’um was so powerful. It was then that the Sonaan and their In turned to Vokunmahfass, who forged Iizyoldein on frostbitten night.

“Vokunmahfass, who creates the shadows of fear, only your thu’um can truly match that of your student. Lower his strun, and we will kill Iizyoldein. That is all we ask!”

“I will do this Joor, but you will listen! He is my own creation, and thus his life is mine. Ok ziil gro dovah ulse. On of your number, come with me.”

“I, Miraak, will do this deed. Out of all the Sonaan gathered today, my zul can sway his mind. With [my knowledge], I can capture our fallen brother for the punishment of your choosing.”

And so [Dovah?] took wing from the Throat and traveled to the Junaar of Iizyoldein covered in strun, which Vokunmahfass broke through and allowed Miraak to enter and do as he pleased. What happened next has been [lost] to the bowels of history, but an epic duel between the two Sonaan and the Dovah resulted in they very landscape being rid of snow and turned to dust, and Bo Od disappeared. Dragged in chains, Iizyoldein was carried back to the Throat for trial which his teacher attended.

“I have done no wrong but done what I’ve wished with my property. Your [cause] of my capture is heresy!”

“You are the only one that has [acted on heresy]. You attained power that does not belong to you, lying and using it as your own. Because of that, your sentence will be dire. Vokunmahfass, give him his [final judgment?].”

“Vokunmahfass? You betray me?!”

“No, Kiir, you [betray me]. I trained you to serve the Dovah until your voice itself cracks and turns to dust. But you mistakenly thought yourself to be a Dovah, and tried to attain power for yourself that belonged to us. [Because of this?], you will suffer the same fate that you inflicted on others. You will be frozen in a solaced tomb in eternal pain, suspended above a pool of fire. Your Iizyol will become your jailor.”

“No! I will break free and I will [unleash the wrath of a thousand fiery winters] on your souls!”

“Silence the Renegade. I think the ruins of his kingdom will be the perfect spot for his prison.”

[And so], Iizyoldein was buried in the tomb of Nahlotod, mummified with ice and encased within a frosted coffin, chained above the pit of fire. However, no one would forget the words Iizyoldein said at the end of his trial. [Icefire…], may it never sing in the halls of Skyrim again.

*[Author’s Note: It seems that the sarcophagus that we have discovered might be that of the legendary Dragon Priest, Iizyoldein. If this is true, then we must immediately cart this off to the Elder Council and never let it seek the light of day again, keeping it under lock and key. For if Iizyoldein reawakens…I fear we might not have such a hero to rescue us again.]*
