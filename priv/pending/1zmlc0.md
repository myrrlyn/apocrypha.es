*[A Partial Truth to the Battle of Red Mountain, which was consequently erased from the minds of almost all that were present on the battlefield that day.]*

#PART III: Within The Heart Chamber
**Indoril Nerevar, “Before The Machine”**
	*“It was magnificent. It was terrifying. And it was standing right there, but I could not act! I had been struck down by Dumac, but not before I was able to strike him in turn. Dagoth, Vivec, and Sul were also here. Wise Sotha and my dear Almalexia were on their way. But something was wrong. Our enemies were fighting amongst themselves; Dumac has turned on the Nord and his cat companion earlier, and now lies on the cold floor himself dying. The cat is not that far from going himself, and the Northern man appears to be fading. Everything is going so wrong…”*

**Vivec, “The Heart”**
	*“Sotha Sil and Almalexia arrive, but is already to late. Sweet Nerevar, Moon and Star, is dying and there is nothing much we can do. But so is Dumac, so is this pyrrhic victory? No, I cannot think such thoughts. I tell his wife to sit by his side and me and Sotha head over to Alandro, who appears to be in much pain. Aren’t we all in pain. I suddenly turn to the right, and there I see it beating. The Heart of Lorkhan itself. The Heart of a god was our reach…and we couldn’t even touch it. Beautiful this was, but scary too. Something to think about this was.”*

**Alandro-Sul, “A Great Unease”**
	*“My eyes! By my mother Azura what have done to my eyes?! I can feel them…screaming…inside of my head in anger. I cannot see, but that does not mean I cannot still fight. Nerevar still breathes and so I shall still breathe. I took an oath on my life to protect his no matter what injuries befell me. Wait, what is that noise? Where is it coming from?”*

**Voryn Dagoth, “The Hist Does Something…”**
	*“As Kragenac activated the Numidium, everyone suddenly stopped existing but continued on existing. We were everywhere but no where, and now I could see inside myself and see myself staring back at me. It was unnerving…but also fascinating and I enjoyed it. What can this mean? What is this even? Can I be true in what I believe or am I wrong? I turned and looked left, and was greeted by a spectacular sight. The Hist was moving across the floor, stretching its root system effortlessly before standing in front of the Numidium. It grabbed a hold of it and started to hum, and suddenly it seemed like the world began to shake itself apart. Whatever the tree was doing, it was making the effect of the activation weaker, and now I am wondering exactly why it came. Was this its goal all this time?”*

**Dro’Zira, “Dying…Funny”**
	*“Dro’Zira did not know that dying would hurt so bad, but it does. He can see funny looking tree in front of the giant statue of ever changing appearance, and now Dro’Zira’s eyes hurt from watching. This was fun to be in one last battle. It will always be fun.”*

**Dumac Dwarfking, “We have all been Betrayed”**
	*“As I laid dying, I felt a tug that was not physical but mental and something else…was it spiritual? By the Fifteen and One tones, it is. I never thought I would ever see the day where I would say such words. What is this that I am seeing? It is like the spectrum of colors and music and sound has broken itself and has overlapped itself and now I can through everything at once. My hands are dissolving, and are dragging towards the Numidium. Is this the godhead that Kragenac told use we could achieve? Is our people finally breaking free from this damn wheel?...No. I do not believe we are. Your voice can leave your body but it cannot leave your mouth. If only my dear friend could’ve remembered that…”*

**Wulfharth, “Banished Again”**
	*“No! I was betrayed once again! Why is this happening? Why does this have to happen again? My heart that is not my heart but is, it’s so close but it is not. Shor forgive! Let myself forgive myself forgive me! The Heart of Shor will return to the North one day, and it will reside within me not me until the end of days. For it is has spoken, and what has been spoken shall come to past. Let there be–”*
