Regarding the Sixth House: Their Lords and Their Deeds

by Senior Armiger Felaren Hlerano

What remains of the "lost" House Dagoth might be measured in piles of dust. The Sharmat is gone, his blighted distemper washed from the land.  His remaining servants cower in caves, carving out tunnels like worms. Yet for each investigation into the strongholds of the Sixth House and each annual preserveration of the Incarnate's path we learn more of their hierarchy, their names, and their accomplishments. Much fits with the testimony given by the Nerevarine and although we cannot fully ascertain elements such as the lives of Sixth House members before their entrapment by the Sharmat, we have enough information to form a confident record of their works during their subjection. Thus we begin with the lords of the Sixth House, the beclouded kin now called Nemer. They numbered six and one lost:

**Dagoth Araynys**- Dirt Regent of Mamaea, called "Evermin" and "Keeper of the Photostatic Numen". Slain by the Incarnate. Appointed entrant of Vivec by the will of the Sharmat. Chief artist of the Sixth House, memory was his chisel. Turning thought to stone, he created the so called ash statues and propagated them throughout Vvardenfell. Immune to the concept of distance and length, he carved as far as Cyrodiil without impediment. From his etchings we understand the obscure lessons of multiplication and patience. By the firsthand account of Hannat Zainsubani, we know how these lessons were applied towards prisoners of the Sixth House to create waking dreams. On death, his body calcified. Transported to Vivec, it remains guarded by Armigers even as I write.  

**Dagoth Endus**- Lord of Endusal, called "Arithmetical Reflector" and "Bibliosophist". Died when sundered from the Sharmat. Appointed entrant of Sotha Sil by the will of the Sharmat, his sundial cast shadows of tergiversation touched with anathemathmatics. The most reclusive of his brothers, little else can be gleaned of Endus beyond his counterclockworks. Examination of his artifacts left the chief arbiter comatose for half a year. By order of the Bifold, they have been destroyed.

**Dagoth Gilvoth**- Vassal of Dagoth Ur, called "Scorial Claviger". Slain by the Incarnate. The destruction of the second Walking Brass makes delving the heart of Red difficult and we must rely largely on the Nerevarine's recollections. Bestial in disposition, Gilvoth was quick tempered and depraved. Holding a collection of the still beating hearts of his enemies, he bound their spirits to the service of the Sixth House and presided over all revenants indentured to the Sixth House as wraith liege.  On his death, they were free to tear at his limbs. The hearts still beat and will be stopped by the will of the Bifold only.

**Dagoth Tureynul**- Lord of Tureynulal, called "Hearthrum Drinker", "Breviloquent Taskmaster", and "Gold Skinner's Curate". Died when sundered from the Sharmat. Scholar and academic, Tureynul presided over dwemer athenaeum with only Endus as equal. Well versed in aurals, recreation of his symphonies by our musicians has melted base iron and warped solid trickster's blood. This art is not uniquely his, being a custom of the Sixth House, but it is clear that his compositions were chief amongst his peers. 

**Dagoth Uthol**- Usurper of Kogoruhn, called "Aphotic Contriver" and "Ash Marshal". Slain by the Incarnate. Appointed entrant of Almalexia by the will of the Sharmat, Uthol focused on the martial and understood strategies that chased after Boethiah. Teacher of venom blooded lessons, he made diamoncut warriors forged for conquest. Impeccable in conduct and mindful of ceremony, he engaged in single combat with the Nerevarine with bones made of swords. The Incarnate gave him a true burial but will not reveal the location to the Temple.

**Dagoth Vemyn**- Lord of Vemynal, called "Womb Snake". Slain by the Incarnate.  Despoilment was his sole intent, with a Coldharbour bold prurience. We do not wish to theorize to what end his lust was directed or what dark magicks were birthed by his copulations. Let history never forget his depravity but never acknowledge his deeds in full.
