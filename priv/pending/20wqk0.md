In a nordic village, there was a cemetery, much smaller than the one in Falkreath. It felt like I was close to High Hrothgar, yet far from it.  I was kind of curious, so I cast a detect life spell and two graves shone. One of the plaques said "Almalexia" and the other said ''The Iron queen".

I started to remove the stones and I swear to Akatosh it was her, it was the grave of Almalexia, it looked like her, pointy ears and all. 

I went to tell people and soon there were travelers all around curious to see the dead body of the living godess.

I started to investigate why her body would be there, and somehow I came across this book. It said that in the 3E 300, there lived a queen that was called Almalexia, named after the godess. She was very inexperienced and became victim of her court, which planned her death.

I didn't know whether to believe that, but the travellers seemed to believe the book and stopped coming.

The coffin was made of a weak material, and I could see inside. I took a last look at the corpse and I swear she looked right int my soul! 

-- I AM THE FACE-SNAKED QUEEN OF THE THREE IN ONE. I GIVE YOU THIS EGG, AND YOU SHALL HOLD TO IT UNTIL MYSTERY COMES. 

What was that all about? I don't know, I just closed the coffin and ran away. 
Then aI woke up and there was an egg right next to my bed...
