*This correspondence was found in the ruins of the College of the Voice, destroyed along with many other buildings during the Forsworn occupation.*

*It would seem that the politics that still trouble many Imperial institutions today were also a problem at the College. One cannot help but wonder: what if the College had accepted this particular instructor's work? Would the arts of the Voice be known to all today?* 

*As it stands it seems unlikely, and much of what can be determined is solely conjecture.*

Hnaf Red-Eye, Archon of Tongues,

I have attempted twice now to publish my extensively researched dissertation on the Greybeards. However, each time you have vetoed the publication of my material. Your sole response, sent after the failure of my second attempt, was simply “controversy”. 

I believe that my dissertation will prove immensely valuable for providing a viable argument against the long-held beliefs the Way of the Voice espouses. Our mission is to promote general usage of the Thu’um from a secular perspective, which conflicts inherently with the philosophy of True Need. Having a paper from an institution as esteemed as this one would prove to eliminate all superstitious nonsense from what is clearly a very potent art.

Sincerely, 

Instructor Claudius

Instructor Claudius,

The College of the Voice appreciates your efforts, and I personally commend your swift rise during your relatively brief time here. However, I must step in as primary official to stop the publishing and distribution of this particular essay. 

You are a gifted scholar, but you are also barely out of boyhood, and as such do not comprehend the nuances of the real world’s politics. That your essay is well-written is not a point of contention. It is. 
However, we intentionally prevent your work from being published for wholly different reasons.

The crux of the matter is that the Greybeards hold a special place in Nordic culture, something I would not expect a Cyrod to understand. Insulting them would only put us under fire from the general populace, and would severely scar our reputation.

Hnaf Red-Eye, Archon of Tongues,

And since when did we allow general opinion to dictate our statements?

I’ll ignore the hint of condescension in your general tone to address your argument. I am aware of the role the Greybeards play in Nordic culture, which is precisely what I wish to address. 

For too long we have been considered inferior to them, simply because they are more exclusive and attach a sense of religiosity to the art of the Voice. This is ridiculous. 

Moreover, nothing in the official policies speaks against my actions. In fact, the Greybeards are not mentioned at all in any official text concerning our conduct or the nature of our publication material. 

Therefore, I submit that your actions taken against me are unsupported by your legitimate authority.

All due respect,

Instructor Claudius

Instructor Claudius,

It would certainly help you to learn a little respect, would it not? I would hate to see the career of such an enterprising and skilled young man go to waste after an untimely discharge. Perhaps you forget at times that you are writing to the highest official in the College. 

Perhaps more severe reminders would be appropriate in the future.

You are a young man, and your naiveté is only to be expected. Perhaps you have heard of unwritten rules and unspoken policies? Our agreement (inasmuch as mutual silence is an agreement) with the Greybeards is one such unspoken policy. 

As an instructor, your work is invaluable, but you fail to comprehend the consequences of your actions. Imagine what the other Nords would say if they read your libellous statements regarding the most revered Tongues in Skyrim, especially from an “upstart” institution such as ours! Do you not forget how highly the Northmen value tradition?

By all means, feel free to publish your work under your own name. Just do not expect our university to support it as official material.
