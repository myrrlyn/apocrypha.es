I promise nothing about the clarity of Part II before you've read Part I!  This is an expansion of ideas found in the first.

**Nagging Question Answered:**

Where did Memory go?  That was the nagging question.  In an earlier thread, I suggested that Memory literally went to Akavir, since it was the light of the new Dream, and east is where new days dawn.  I later backed off of that, along with the idea of Trans-Amaranth travel, but I think I was actually onto something.  Memory literally went with the Flower Baby into its new Dream.

This is not because Anu's Akavir is identical with Tosh Raka's Akavir.  Dream B and Dream C remain separate Amaranths without conventional joined borders.  More on this in a bit.

Rather, Memory left *with(in)* the Flower Baby, who later took the shape of Tosh Raka within Dream C based on what it found in Memory about the big shots in Dream B's Akavir.  That is, Memory joined with or entered the Flower Baby as it left to forge its own form within the Godhead.

And, since Memory's departure was the cause of the infinite c0da digressions, that leaves room for each c0da to form its own internal Memory, which would also depart if that c0da produces an Amaranth, splitting into yet another infinity of variations.

**Trans-Amaranth Travel**

Remember how I said the Amaranths don't share conventional borders?  Typically we think of borders as physical lines we cross, or abstractions of those lines, laid over geography.  I maintain that crossing geographical borders does not allow Trans-Amaranth travel.

But there may be a different kind of border, that allows a different kind of crossing.  We've discussed before that Amaranths have symbolic overlaps.  See here:

&gt; * dream A = Yokuda of myth + unknown Tamriel + unknown Akavir

&gt; * dream B = remembered Yokuda + Tamriel we know + Akavir we know

&gt; * dream C = remembered Yokuda + Remembered Tamriel + Unknown Akavir.

What else do these Dreams have in common?  Well, the omnipresent laws of the Godhead, certainly.  And I think that's enough to get Trans-Amaranth travel.

Imagine sailing to Dream B's Akavir.  There you are, in a symbol of the future, having crossed the ocean, a symbol of the Godhead.  You're not in Dream C.  Not yet.  But what if you knew that Dream C existed?  What if you had knowledge of the Godhead, of CHIM and Amaranth; what then?

I think, as long as the Akavir of Dream C were sufficiently similar to the symbol-Akavir of Dream B (based on the lineage of Memory), that the resemblance could be formed into a bridge between the two.  If you knew enough about Will, and Love, and the Godhead and its contents, you could trick/convince/Will the Godhead into placing you in both Dreams at once (possible because the Godhead's laws are present in both).  Then, you'd just back off of your presence in Dream B, and there you are.  You just traveled from a progenitor Dream to its progeny Dream.  Maybe you're slightly different due to the changes in physics between the two, but hey, close enough.

This should not be thought of as mere time traversal!  It is *reality* traversal.  But, because realities have sequential lineage through Memory, it can have the timetravel-like effects described by threads like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/21akfu/the_tsaesci_creation_myth_reexamined/).
