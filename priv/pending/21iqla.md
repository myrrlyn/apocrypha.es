Aka-Tusk is built like my house, with a basement, ground floor and attic. Although the roof reaches to the heavens with breathless anticipation, it is supported by the foundation-bones rooted deep in the five corners of the world. In the depth and isolation of millennia, the dragons discovered an aberrant entity which offered them secrets it could not possibly have access to. Although they first considered a hostile takeover, the entity, which called itself Hermaeus Mora, seemed happy enough to offer its knowledge in exchange for some of the dragon's own lore. It is also believed  by some that the dragons sensed some remote draconic background in the mysterious, androgynous thing. And so, for untold centuries the dragons grew fat with knowledge and understanding of the universe. And they thought to themselves, "Why should we not be the rulers over mortals, as benevolent dictators to instruct them in absolute moral good?"

But there was a facet of the universe they did not totally understand, and it was a secret very close to the heart of everything. By setting themselves up as King, they were engendering a pattern in the world which manifested in a sword for them to fall on. And thus began the enantiomorph between Alduin and the Dragonborn. They both share the strength and power of a true dovah's soul, but they also share the dovah's greed for secrets. For most people, interest in knowledge is a positive trait, but dragons lack all common sense when it comes to reading forbidden lore.

The Dragon Cult never really died on Solstheim, it was just buried. The Last Dovahkiin was last seen entering that place several years ago. Most people say he's given Miraak a stiff beating and triumphed over evil once again. I have far graver fears. If the Dragonborn stumbled across any forbidden texts while in that ancient and dangerous land, he may have been seduced into *replacing* Miraak as the new ruler of the Dragon Cult, doomed to spend all eternity in Apocrypha.
