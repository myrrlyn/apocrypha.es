You're gonna need to read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1tp1oa/the_proctor/) and probably [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1zzznj/the_proctor_ii_maiqs_revenge/).

Just when I had thought I'd exhausted all the evidence and info at hand, I find this...

*2) M'Aiq, don't forget the hypnogogic part spun along the nature of Tamriel with an admixture of the love of parenthood that would follow. Not the "power"-- the cherishing.*  
-Michael Kirkbride  

Yes, even MK knows it's true. But, then again, don't we all?  

Let's analyze.  

First off, what does "hypnogogic" mean?  

*Hypnogogic: of, relating to, or occurring in the period of drowsiness immediately preceding sleep*  

The time between reality and dreams, when you drift between the real and the false. A fitting metaphor for the life of M'aiq, who dwells within and without our world, part in it and part in his. As demonstrated in my "brain-skip" metaphor from the first entry, ideas from M'aiq's world tend to leak in through his speech. He has trouble discerning between what is his home and his Dream.  

He is spun along the nature of Tamriel as the essence from which all was created. "Nature" could be viewed in two ways here. M'aiq is the nature of Tamriel in that it is born from him, it is him. The nature of Tamriel, the temperament and personality, is also it's own, as it has progressed on its own. We have two ideas of nature spun along Tamriel. Two ideas spun together that make up the world. What shape do two things spun together take? [I think we all know.](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/daviddisalvo/files/2011/11/DNA.jpg)  

The last bit sure sounds like Love. Now, we have no concrete definition of what Love really is or how it works, so you'll have to abide by my conjecture here. To me, Love isn't some force fundamentally required in CHIM and Amaranth, but rather something you develop as a result. Dumb people don't achieve CHIM. All the lessons and meditations you undergo on the path to Heaven enlighten you. Love is a collection of the lessons you learn that teach you to take the whole of the universe. M'aiq is pretty well versed in Love, he did achieve Amaranth after all. Love is a cherishing, not a power, like I described. You don't realize Love and suddenly gain super CHIM powers, it was there all along. And it's pretty easy to interpret the statement of parenthood, as we're all the children of M'aiq's dream.  

I didn't expect to write another of these, and I don't expect to write another. But who knows? Something else may drop, and I'll be watching, reading, ready to learn more about the Liar.
