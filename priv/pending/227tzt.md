*This is an exerpt from an article describing Akavirii culture to an unknown outsider.*

As a foreigner wandering the lands of Akavir, one may be surprised to come across one of the stone totems of Jeshi-re.

Jeshi-re is known as the singer of wisdom, he who taught the Akavirii their dances. His worship is common to all cultures of Akavir. When the people of Akavir needed to know the proper way to fight, he gave them their Forms, from which came the totems. As a result, he plays a major role in the cultural and spiritual history of Akavir, and his disciples are the artist-historians.

He is also called the keeper of the rule of totems, and is said to have taught the peoples of Akavir the secrets of totem-keeping. It is according to his law that the people of Akavir take a totem and keep it for all their life. Those that break his law are cursed, either with the wildness of the Ferals, or the self-denial of the mannish Savages.

The law-liths dedicated to him can be found in many settlements as well as in secluded spots in the wilderness, and are often centers of spirituality for the people of Akavir.
