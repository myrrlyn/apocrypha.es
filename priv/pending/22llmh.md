Heart stone Research By Neloth Telvanni And completed by Talvas Fathryon

My master Neloth was a master wizard; he researched the hearthstones of Solstheim. One day he sent me to the settlement of the Skaal to get a package of stalhrim made equipment. I went on my way, and when I finally returned to Tel Mithryn days later, it had become a ruin. In the center of the ruin I found the body of Master Neloth. My master dead, in his chest was the strangest heart stone have ever seen, apparently he had tried to do an heart stone implant alone. I did an autopsy of his body, he did not fail, he had done the implant perfectly, but the stones power rejected Master Neloth and therefor it killed him. As his apprentice it is my duty to publish what survived of my master notes to prove him right. Fathryon.

… The heart stones first appeared on Solstheim after the eruption of Vvardenfell. It is my belief that they have a connection with the Heart of Lorkhan. The most reasonable thing to think here is that they are the stones that was close to the heart and therefore absorbed some of its power before the destruction of the heart. But another possibility a far less likely possibility, is that the heart stones is the manifestation of the Heart of Lorkhans power. The Heart of Lorkhans power still here in Mundus…

… I had a breakthrough today, I had an adventurer find out who was behind my resent troubles, and it was my late apprentice Ildari Sarothril who died after I replaced her heart with a heart stone. The heart stone’s power had brought her back from the dead. The power of the heart stones is therefore proven to have a strong connection with resurrection...

… If one stone can bring a person back from the dead, imagine what several stones can do. I placed to stones close proximity, the result was fascinating indeed. The stones were drawn towards the other, before they melted together. It is as if the stones long to be together, to be as one. The power of the fused stone was greater than that of a normal heart stone…

… I have gotten several stones together in the last few years. And now their form is starting to look like a heart from the humanoid races of Nirn. If I continue like this, I think they will soon be a true heart. Because of this I think that the heart stones are the manifestation of Lorkhans heart, which is trying to recreate its physical form…

… I have done it, the work that I have done the past decade has born fruits. The fused heart stone now looks like a real heart, except the power that flows from it. I will send Talvas away while I place the heart inside myself, if all goes well I will become more powerful than the Tribunals ever was... And that was the last Neloth Telvanni wrote. From the power that radiates from the heart stone in Neloth chest, and his notes I conclude that he was successful in reforming the Heart of Lorkhan, or a great part of it. I will take it, and all the heart stones I can find and move to a secret location while I confirm if it is real or not.
