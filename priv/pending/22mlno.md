Imperial Natural Philosophy and Practical Magic Department
Memo #2433
In the Reign of Reman II

That falling is the natural condition of leaping, particularly from high places, is an unnecessary observation.  It is obvious to all participants in mortal life.  Nevertheless, in recent years scholars have begun to apply the growing understanding of natural phenomena and common magics to more and more areas of concern.  It was only a matter of time before the department would raise the question of what it is that causes things to fall.  Though the question was raised in memo #17 of the library, only now has the council accepted our answer as satisfactory.

Falling, then, must be distinguished from other phenomena in order to isolate its unique characteristics.  In the heavens, there is a regular motion of lights and bodies.  As far as is known, there is a suspension of forces that seems to hold the cosmic portrait together.  Crude orreries, even, require the most extensive lattice work to keep their parts from collapsing to the ground.  We can easily conclude that falling is a force that is not present in the greater void, but then is likely specific to the spheres.

In the waters and the deep we observe a floating, whereby buoyant forces allows the interaction of objects without a falling force.  In these environments philosophers have deduced the law of equal and opposite reactions.  Falling forces appear to be singular in direction, and thus don't fall under the category of general forces.  This evidence is what finally convinced the council to accept a theory of falling forces.

The general laws of physical forces imply a direct connection and interaction of presence between objects which exchange force and momentum.  Objects that are enchanted, or which are transmuted out of Nirn's influence, whether in dark art or the seeking of divine blessing, these do not succumb to the general laws of forces when interacted upon by other mundane objects.  Moreover, principles of magical levitation further evidence that the falling force is unique to the binding power that exists within a cosmic sphere of influence.

Essentially, the cosmic bodies are understood to be bubbles of tangibility.  Nirn is the most prominent, but the other spheres maintain tangibility of their own.  The space between them, having less tangibility, has yet greater tangibility than the outer void.  This is evidenced by the motion of the spheres relative to each other.  Physical force is a symptom of objects coexisting within the same paradigm of tangibility.  Obviously, two objects cannot occupy the same space at the same time - this is a law of tangible reality.  Thus, they react when brought together.  This is seen in the clashing of swords, or even the bouncing together of two child's toy balls.

Undergirding these laws of tangibility is the law of bound reality.  Tangibility is the product of some magical binding, and thus a superphysical metanatural force is the origin of the laws of physical interactions.  This force is what produces the falling.  

Drawing from memo #258, wherein is discussed the spheres of tangibility, we learn of the hypostatic boundary of spheres.  The spheres appear in the form they do only to retain comprehensibility to the mortal mind.  In fact, it has long since been proven that these spheres are infinite in expanse.  The form of the sphere represents only the nature of the boundary of tangibility.  Each boundary layer presents, it is speculated, an infinipoint trap in the interaction between Anuaic and Padomaic forces.  These boundaries, a fabric of sorts, sign the tune of the world.  Each sphere is the microcosmic mirror of Aurbis' form.  The Aetherial surrounding the Void.  Thus, the void between spheres is indeed flat along the Aurbic surface, though it appears as space so that the spheres retain their proper mirror forms.

Within Mundus, even without, the influence of spheres pull upon each other.  Thus, presence upon a sphere has the appearance of height.  While a denizen of Nirn may climb a mountain to stand high above the surface of their sphere, in fact they remain flat upon it.  Tangibility demands that they cannot remain in the sphere and yet be any way separated from it.  

The exception is that height approximates waxing and waning influences of other spheres.  Upon a mountain one is fully upon Nirn, and yet closer to, say, Kynareth.

Thus, tangibility pulls upon the high object, exerting a falling force.  This force seeks equal tangibility between all objects, so that the normal laws of reaction can apply.

The implications of such are important.  For one, the utility of tower construction is apparent.  A tower stretches the tangibility of a local region of the surface boundary.  It strains the forces of tangibility, and allows for them to be more easily manipulated, in particular: tuned.

Geologic formations are then, clearly, the aftermath of great struggles in the cosmic past of Nirn as tangibility established itself.

There are of course criticisms to this theory.  What of underground caves?  Why do they not possess a rising force?

This is easily countered by a return to sphere theory.  The form of a sphere allows the proper Aurbic mirror balance between Anuaic and Padomaic forces.  The hunger of Padomaic energy is an omnipresent reality of our universe.  The laws of tangibility are not so mundane as to attempt to maintain all objects upon the surface of the land - say, at sea level.  Rather, the falling force pulls objects away from the influence of other spheres.  Indeed, if one could fall to the center of Nirn they would likely find themselves in the pit of Oblivion.  And yet, this is no irony.  It is foolish to perceive these spheres as having diameter of quantifiable measure.  It is very likely that the sea's deep is simply land surface covered in water, with caves perhaps underneath that, forever, all flat and infinite in spread.  Take for example the kingdoms of Dreugh.

Yes, 'up' takes one to other spheres.  And yet, no, one cannot simply visit the moons on the back of a dragon.  There is a breaking out of the sphere that is required.  Magical fields of tangibility preservation at the least.

Nevertheless, a sufficiently magical creature might regard 'up' as a means of transcosmic travel.  The leaper demons of myth perhaps possessing a form of this ability.

Of course, be well wary of the sea, as dark being of Oblivion may yet magically rise up from this deep to reach Mundus just as they might pierce it from above.

The spheres are not physical, but represent the distribution of energies.  Oblivion is as much within Nirn's center as it is without Mundus' influence.

Nevertheless, for practical clockworkmen and magical scientists alike, the secret to the falling force - or rather to beating is - is weakening the tangibility bonds acting upon an object.
