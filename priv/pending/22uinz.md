By Hroldar Hearty-Beard, True Skald of Haafingar.

***

             
In the 174th year of the Fourth Era, a boy whom would be named *Torygg* was born to the rulers of the Hold of Haafingar in the province of Skyrim. Shortly after his birth, he was escorted out of the region to the city of Jehanna in High Rock along with his mother, High Queen Freyda, for his Father, High King Istlod was wary of the war in Cyrodiil spilling over into Shor's Land.

There he remained for the first sixteen years of his life under the stewardship of his second cousin King Garrick of Jehanna. After it was revealed that Garrick and Freyda had been intimate while she was still married to Istlod, Torygg abandoned Jehanna and returned to Solitude, furious with his mother's betrayal, and asked of his father to introduce them to the headsman's axe. An ambassador was sent from the Imperial City on behalf on the Emperor upon hearing of Torygg's plan to seek a diplomatic solution. The Nord was enraged that his father would obey a Cyrod over his own son, and left Solitude with the intention of never returning.

He entered his eighteenth year in the city of Dawnstar of the Pale where he had been taken under the wing of Jarl Skald. 

Skald himself had not taken part in the Great War seventeen years prior, but instead had surrounded himself with veterans of the conflict.

 Torygg was in awe of the stories that had been told around fires, of how the Nords in the Legion had slain the elves with no mercy, of how the Nords were instrumental in aiding Titus Mede II in the Battle of the Red Ring, and of how a Nord with the power of Old had taken out a whole battalion by himself. Torygg asked who this man was, and he was pointed in the direction of the Cidhna Mines of Markarth.
