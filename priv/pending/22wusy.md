You are I may look right, or left. The Elder Scrolls look both right and left, *and* through our right, *and* our left. This false paradox is easily understood through the flame-in-void (or fish-in-water) model as presented by Septimus Signus in *Ruminations on the Elder Scrolls*. To summarize: we are the void and the Scrolls the light which defines the void as self-knowing, saving it from the unknowing-self of emptiness. 

When read by a perception point of the self-seeing void, the Scrolls respond to the perception vector of that void-point such that the vector may interact with a currently unpredictable set of void-points (research pending). 

Due to the All Sight of the Scroll, the Scroll cannot be that which changes as they see all possible perception vectors within the Wheel. How then, is it possible to read a Scroll, to change the Scroll into something read? 

We resolve the conflict:

There can be no change in void without dependence on the unvoid of the Scroll. Therefore, The Scroll cannot change so the void must change, and by the void changing the Scroll is Also non-insignificantly changed (from That to That-which-changed). Thus, only from the *consequence* of reading is the reading possible. 

The left-right seeing of the Scroll sees no conflict, and no change.  The fish does not swim through the water, so the water must move around the fish. The fish looks left-right and knows only all views by which the water sees it, and so knows every angle of itself; except one. 

Here is the danger of Scroll tampering: should the left-right of All Sight be broken into left and right, the blinded Scroll might look *up* and know the edge of the Wheel. That way lies madness, for without the fish the water cannot move.
