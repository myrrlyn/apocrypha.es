*The following tome was discovered after the Legion captured Fort Snowhawk from the rebels in the third century of the Fourth Era.*

If anyone discovers this journal, take note that these are the words of Gunnar, son of Jarl Bronjar the Seer of Snowhawk.

It has been five days since these so called *Gates to Oblivion* have been appearing all over Skyrim. The daedra that spawned from the Deadlands have so far kept to themselves, which is unnerving the population moreso than if they were raping and pillaging them. I have orded the people to move to the fort if the daedra advance towards the city and to not attempt to make contact with the monsters.

6 Hearth Fire

The Legion deserted us and went back to Cyrodiil as soon as news of Emperor Uriel's death broke, and we have been worse off for it. We have sent for help from Solitude and Dawnstar, but Thian and Macalla have let our pleas fall on deaf ears thus far. I fear worse is yet to come.

The walls have been breeched.

Snowhawk is lost.
