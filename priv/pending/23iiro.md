Among other things, Riften is a dumping ground for the unwanted of society. War, famine, or simple neglect leave many children on its harsh and unforgiving streets. Not even the passing Pilgrim of Stendarr stops to pay attention to them. As far as he is concerned - as far as Skyrim society as a whole is concerned - the homeless and orphaned are bait, to be devoured by or assimilated into the ever-growing criminal element. Little solace is to be found in such a life.

With the advent of the Dragonborn, however, new life has been breathed into the near-invisible subculture of street children. Anywhere in today's Riften, the sights of children sharing stories with each other or praying in imitation of the Priests of Mara are common. What has sparked this renewal?

**The Thousand And One Secrets**

Not too long ago, according to one 13-year-old boy, Shor was driven from his hall in Sovngarde. The Winter Court (see **Gods And Entities** section) wanted to steal all his secrets, of which there were a thousand and one. 

"Some of the secrets, they got." he says. "But they didn't learn all of 'em."

Shor himself disappeared that night, and all the fairies and dead heroes put together could not find him. Some say that he was taken by the Greedy People and killed, but "they're wrong", according to Freyja, an 8-year-old girl. 

"Shor couldn't be dead. He just can't." she says, tears in her eyes. "Then who's going to keep all the secrets?"

Perhaps the central figure in Nordic mythology's uncertain state is reflective of the perils these children face every day. You and I take living until ripe old age as a given. That could not be further from the realities these children face. For them, death may come as a knife in the back, or a gnawing stomach and legs too weak to stand...or even dismemberment by Other Things or the Mara-Bitch.

Regardless of Shor's status, the fairies and dead heroes of Sovngarde all convened in their hall. It was decided that they were to impart some of the Secrets to all those who would listen. The Kings and Emperors and noblemen, however, were all swayed by the words of the Winter Court.

The reason why they were so easily fooled was explained by Aman, a 9-year-old Redguard boy. "Maybe they're just dumb." Aman says.

Indeed, the rich are not viewed upon with kindness. "One day, the World-Eater's gonna gobble 'em up with all their gold and houses." says Rolff, a Nord boy of 12. "Then they won't be so happy all the time and won't be able to make fun of us." The wealthy and powerful are always doomed to invariably grisly fates in the end, as a result of their greed and/or foolishness.

At this point, it is impossible to understand their mythology without first understanding the beings that people it. It must be understood that these beings are parts of reality for them, not vaguely defined personages resting somewhere in Oblivion or Aetherius. Every thing, every event, and every ragged breath is overseen, sanctioned and permitted by these beings. 

**Gods And Entities**

**The Summer Court** - The Summer Court comprises all the allies of Shor, who were left wanting without him to guide them. In all tales involving them, they side with the downtrodden and the underdog - likely because they are in much the same position. Good is always portrayed as on the losing side in this mythology. 

* **Fairies** - Fairies are all of "Shor's sons and daughters", like Men "but better". Every time a moonbeam shines on Mundus, a new fairy is born. Children's smiles are said to feed their power, which is why the Winter Court tries so hard to make so many little kids miserable. Along with Spirits, Fairies are the primary agents of Good in the world.

* **Spirits** - The difference between *Spirits* and *Ghosts* is very well-established. Spirits refer specifically to the ghosts aligned with Shor, usually the dead Nord heroes expelled from his hall but also the ghosts of living agents of the Winter Court. Sometimes they visit living descendants in dreams. Mostly they give new orders, but some of them share more stories.

* **Sygria** - The "Lady of Ragged Waters", who always looks over abandoned and orphaned children. The cover of Night is actually water from her "special pool", drawn over Mundus to provide protection for agents of the Summer Court. "Grown-ups say that night-time is bad, but that's 'cus the Winter Court tells 'em that." explains Freyja. Sygria is considered Shor's sister, and every time she weeps for her lost brother her tears become the stars. Prayers to her are always made in absolute silence. Nocturnal has been unavailable for comment, despite repeated attempts by the College to contact her.

* **Children of Sygria** - The origins of these entities are disputed. Some say that they are the literal children of Sygria, violently ripping themselves from her womb all at once. Others say they are merely agents of Good, inducted into her secret circle hidden somewhere in Lake Honrich. "I saw one of 'em once!" Aman insists. "She looked like a dark elf, but she had the biggest blue eyes I ever saw. Was sneaking into the house of a rich man. Said she was going to protect him from the World-Eater by taking some of his stuff." He is interrupted by a flood of younger boys teasing him. 

* **Shor's Many Skins** - Shor was "like a snake who always sheds his skin", and his shed skins took on lives and powers of their own. All these skins, they say, are the heroes and legends who lead by example. The Dragonborn is the most recent of the Skins, but past Skins have been Talos (whose words were "corrupted by the Winter Court" and "mixed with lies") and Saint Veloth.

* **Metteya** - The origins of this word are in very archaic Nordic, and they are taken to mean "greatest and most majestic of prophets". Metteya is the teacher who will come at the End of the World, when the World-Eater will return for good, and teach all righteous peoples all of the Thousand and One Secrets so they may defeat the Winter Court. He is the last of Shor's Skins, but thanks to Shor's mysterious disappearance it is uncertain if he will appear at all. 

* **Other Agents** - Thieves who steal from the rich and powerful are considered agents of the Summer Court, whether they are aware of it or not. Orphans who tell these stories, of course, are also viewed as agents of the Court. There are also countless others who are unknown to even the Summer Court, yet are working against the Winter Court's machinations.

**The Winter Court** - It may surprise some that the Winter Court is not an organization *per se*. Rather, the Winter Court is a "wanted list" of sorts, listing numerous organizations and gods that are easily identifiable by most people. 

* **The World-Eater** - Described as a "black stain with red eyes" and the "worst monster ever", the World-Eater is easy for us to pin down as Alduin. Shor and his Skins defeated him, but eventually he will return when the Mara-Bitch’s reign is ended. Then only Metteya will be able to fight him, but (as mentioned before) even that is uncertain. His favorite snack is the wealthy, not because he sympathizes with the poor but because he hates the Mara-Bitch and all who serve her. Interestingly enough, when Akatosh is brought up, the response is invariably a vigorous shaking of heads, followed by silence. 

* **The Empire** - The name should not mislead you; it does not refer to the Third Empire alone. Rather, it refers to all systems of government, which are described as being controlled by the Mara-Bitch. The Stormcloaks and the Dominion have also been referred to as “The Empire”, despite being bitterly opposed. "The Empire" is also used to describe the guards of Riften, who are viewed as a single malevolent entity in many bodies. 

* **The Other Things** - Daedra are said to lurk in every darkened corner and alley. The Covenant was “a big sham” played by Alduin, not Akatosh, and Daedra just hide “in all the unseen places”. Mehrunes Dagon was just a “really big Other Thing”, and is in league with Alduin.  Victims of the Other Things are found in the sewers, gored beyond recognition. Interestingly enough, Nocturnal is never described as an "Other Thing".

* **The Mara-Bitch** - While the Other Things are allowed dominion over the streets, the Mara-Bitch is allowed dominion over the world. What this means is unknown, but it does mean that "she can listen to you from anywhere". The wealthy and powerful all owe allegiance to her, and only through her authority are the Other Things allowed to dwell on Mundus. Uniquely, she is capable of destroying souls by drowning them in her own "secret rivers". Alduin is only kept from "gobbling up the whole world" because even he is afraid of her. All things bend to her will, and there is no-one who is safe from her. When Shor saw that she was leading her army to Sovngarde, he cried out in despair and fled: for was Mara not his wife, who bore his child Mundus?

I leave you with this chilling and very vividly imagined mythology, constructed over time by the unwanted children of the world.
