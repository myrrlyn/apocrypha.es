*“…change, change, and change again. Sap flows through our veins, and links us at the root. Scales of our mothers and fathers shed off and we wear them as capes, and there are many capes for many people(s).*

*When we venture from the root to swim in the river, we must let ourselves go so that we can be carried by its current. Other races ask us to tell them truths about ourselves, but become angry when we start at the part where we remember.*

*We slithered and crawled and leaped and hopped and flew and none of those things within the burrows of the dark things, to escape from you.*

*You were everywhere. Why wouldn’t you go away?*

*And we slithered and crawled and leaped and hopped and flew and none of those things into the sap, and we smelled it. Then we smell something sweet, something sour, something ancient and new and not here and also here. It smelled of comfort.”*

**GREETINGS.**

*“Comfort comes from the sap. All comfort comes from the sap and nothing else matters.”*

**REPEAT. GREET?**

*“The sap drips from the roots like honey drips from beehives, and we drink it.”*

**AH.**

**…**

**NO.**

*“Nothing exists without the sap, not us and neither do you. We swallow, and everything opens. Nothing else is hidden now.”*

**GREETINGS?**

*“Greetings.”*

**YES.**

*“This is the truth of our people. Come and drink from the root with us, and understand.”*
