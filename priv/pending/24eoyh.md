SUBDESIGNATE: SILTSTRIDERS

SUBMISSION 7

My masters,

As with my previous submissions, I must sadly report that no additional growth has occurred. The creatures given to my by Master Neloth appear to have gone through their final moult and are no longer showing any signs of continued growth. Whether it is due to our suboptimal climate or inadequate nutritional supplementation is a mystery. 

However, it may not remain such. A feral Nix-Hound, no doubt escaped from the midden-warrens near the triloth chamber, broke into my corrals early this morning and murdered poor Brucie. I was able to intervene and save the remains before too much damage was done, and I have begun a thorough autopsy and dissection. 

Unfortunately my work was halted by a request from the CULTURECOVEN, who found some particularly rare documents in a pre-landfall fungal archive yesterday, and decoding them took priority. However, I assure you I got back to Brucie’s dissection before too much putrification set in and have some remarkable results to share:

I have found, in the creature’s digestive tract, a sort of rumen that expels acid when stuffed with vegetable matter. With the help of a temple Necromancer [and the approval of the prefects on the basis of scientific interest], we were able to restore limited function to the organ, and found that it, quite remarkably, appears to metabolize inherent alchemical properties of the Strider’s food. 

Neloth insists that both ash yams and coda flowers were a regular part of the Siltstrider’s diet in the old days. Although these ingredients are both rare and precious given our current situation, I would like to submit to the board to requisition a supply of said ingredients on the grounds of scientific betterment of all Dunmerkind. Thank you. 

Yours forever in service to the saints,
Aldos Hlarys,
