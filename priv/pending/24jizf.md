The Yokudan creation myth references an Akel who is the "hungry stomach" of Satak, the first serpent.

I always pegged Akel as Sithis, or the soul of Padomay.  Padomay being Satak, and born of her.

In a head slapping moment I've realized Akel is Akatosh, perhaps even Anuiel in this rendering.

You see, Akel is time.  Static change.  Each moment frozen forever, constantly chasing the next moment.

Thus Akatosh is a hungry dragon.  Time's appetite for the present is insatiable.

Of course, Vehk describes Lorkhan as running away from Akatosh.  He always wants to see new things, and Akatosh keeps trying to eat him.  In this sense, they are the two sides of the same coin.

Time is unitary, it is one thing.  There is the chaser and the chased, but they share the same hunger and the same pace.

By this logic, Alduin has nothing to do with Lorkhan.  He is Akatosh.  It's the curse of time, all good things come to an end.  Great moments happen only once.

The Psijiics so venerated this birth of the dragon they named themselves after the agent responsible.  That is, their holy stasis Anu - or state of zero becoming, full potential - was compelled to *act* by the Padomaic essence, thus becoming time.  PSJJJJ becomes another milestone in the history of Padomaic veneration.  Anu's lust was kindled by Padomay's beauty (is one way of looking at it), and he ventured into that 'thing' of becoming.  And this is the dragon.

In this light, Akatosh is not essentially an Anuaic entity.  He is the union. 

His one mirror-aspect, Auriel, looks 'up' or back in time, and sees ending, and is confused and troubled by it.  He wants to preserve it.

His other mirror-aspect, Lorkhan, looks 'down' or forward in time, and sees beginning, and is confused and trouble by it.  He wants the process of becoming to continue, and is compelled to pursue the new at all costs.

Magnus is potential, to be one or the other.  The ritual of becoming.

Note that Auri-El, Lorkhan, and Magnus are absent from Mundus, in the end.

This is Akatosh's 'insanity'.

Anu/Padomay/Akatosh.  King/Rebel/Observer.  Warrior/Thief/Mage.  Anuiel/Sithis/Aurbis.  Aetherius/Oblivion/Mundus.  Impossipoint/Heart/Sun.  Sun/Moon/Earth.  Auriel/Lorkhan/Magnus.  Sunder/Keening/Wraithguard.  Ayem/Vehk/Seht.   Wulfharth/Hjalti/Zurin. Lord/Tower/Ritual.

What do we call these?
Godhead, Enantiomorph, The Wheel, Tamriel, Trinimac, Numidium, ALMSIVI, Talos, Amaranth.

How do we render Nu-Hatta's 'towers'?
The Tower as the Tower?
The Stone as the Lord?
The Intent as the Ritual?

Or are we blinded by purile semantics?
The Stone as the Tower?
The Tower as the Lord?
The Intent as the Ritual?

Towers contain secrets, but then, is not the secret of a tower it's 'tower aspect' or it's 'tower soul'?  The structure of the tower 'lords' over the land, and shapes reality according to its mythitecture.

The ritual is the process of intent or design behind a tower.  Usually this is the tower's construction.  But history has shown that mythic events can reshape a tower, and remake the land.  Same stone, same tower, new ritual.
