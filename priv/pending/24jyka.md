&gt;The following was found in the journal of a scout from the Ebonheart Pact. From the writing we can deduce they were an Ashlander of the Erabenimsun tribe. Much of the journal is unsalvageable; here remains one of the few legible pages. We estimate the dating circa 2E 581.
 
&gt;-Domitila Sestius, Substract Archivist, Mage's Guild, Cyrodiil 

When asked to name itself, it dared to take the wise woman’s staff and scribe within the fallen soot: ∅. Following, it seized the Ashkan’s blade and carved marrowtrue revealing a stoned heart. Thus, it showed itself to be thrice skinned. The hue of life, the rot of death, and the ash of Atherius coated its body. Speaking:

*“I am walker of the Molag’d dust, dream of the dead dreaming dreamer, Vemyn friend, and solar ash mender. My house numbers six and none. My age: 4444. My second age: 55555. Attend, Erabenimsun! Attend the words of the Sharmat’s slave! Red Sunder'd and tune set, a death knell rang throughout the Mount and slithered out the dreamsleeve, circling around to bounce off itself, ending at the start. For aurals made Keen can do little else.*

*The note contraposed the Sharmat's inverse endeavor. Nirn trembled. Vvarden fell. Red's spine snapped. Triangular idols melted. A Tusk septum tore and we, Doht Seht, awoke far from Molag'd earth. Golden eyed thal stamped out the wonder-mirrors of belief forevermore, far worse than the Sharmat's second bounding brass destruction drive ever could. With only shards left, what you know as the spun web could not self sustain and broke, clicking all the while. First brass remained forged and awoke on Landfall. The World Egg cracked and Aurbis subtracted to bring us here again. For aurals made Keen can do little else."*

At this, ∅ reached into its chest and ripped the stoney heart out, breaking into ash.
