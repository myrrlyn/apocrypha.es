"I am no longer amazed at the maze," Sotha Sil continued, "having walked through all the paths of the maze. I am amazed that the maze is a maze, and am amazed that others are not aware of the maze, but wish to help them become amazed at the maze and then transcend their amazement."

"What is at the end of the maze?" Vivec asked, though he fully knew well the answer. 

"Divinity," Sotha Sil said, and Almalexia hummed to herself in thought.
