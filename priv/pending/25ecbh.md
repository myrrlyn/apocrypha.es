Day 0, Cycle A

We've launched. The mission is ~~perhaps~~ the most exhilarating thing to ever happen to me. We're going to try to land on Akatosh. It took a while for us to decide that Akatosh would be the objective, but since it's the symbol of the Empire we decided that it would be best. 

Llevan is our Mananeer. His job is making sure that the Sigil Stones continue to function, that our wards are constantly running, and that the cycles continue to flow properly. He-Who-Reads is the navigator. Self explanatory job, really.  is in charge of maintaining supplies without breaking anything, and with assisting Llevan where required. I do a little of everything.

We're all highly accomplished mages, which is necessary for what we're doing. I'm the only man, Llevan and  are both Mer: Dunmer and Altmer to be specific. He-Who-Reads is obviously, from the name, an Argonian. It took us a while to decide on them, but they were all highly recommended. 

We're all males. Don't want any distractions, after all. Dark Elves are a little weird about that though, but we checked Llevan for any errant tendencies. So we're all alone, for however long it takes us to get to Akatosh. 

Divines protect us.
