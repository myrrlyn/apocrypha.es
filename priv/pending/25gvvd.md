Day 3, Cycle A

Three cycles to a day. I wonder how soon we will adjust to the repetition of day, twilight, night, instead of the 24 hour cycle of the sun and moon in the sky we're all used to. He-Who-Reads seems to be used to it already. I know Llevan was complaining to about not waking up properly. I give it a week at most. 

Strangely the Moons have not yet decreased in size, visually, though Nirn has. I don't know exactly why this is. hypothesizes that it might be "Moon Madness," as the soldiers call it. Our ship was specifically designed to keep us stable, so I doubt that Oblivion's melancholy can get past our wards, and Llevan agrees with me. 

I think it's more likely that we're dealing with a consequence of the metaphysical form of the Moons. Why they're taking longer to grow smaller than they do to grow larger when you go from Tamriel to them, I don't know. 

It's a mystery.

Divines protect us.
