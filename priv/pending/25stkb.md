3E20        
Day 7, Cycle B

We got the new shipment of supplies today. Finally, something aside from potatoes and grain bars! I'll have to see if I can hide a few oranges. 

Watching make the portal through the wards back to base was interesting. His inner eye is certainly more open than mine, but then, that's why we chose him for the job. 

I have to wonder what they'll do with our biowaste. Are they going to flush it? Burn it? Study it? I never asked, because every time I think about it I laugh. 

Nothing out of the ordinary has happened today. Nirn and the Moons are but specks. I welcome the break from existential terror, but I hope that the trip will not be too uneventful.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
