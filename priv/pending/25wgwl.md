"Because first you need to understand before I must".

"I nor we nor they should be hated. Perhaps I should, for I may choose some times, when I permit myself to do so. But other times, I do not have the judgement. Just as you or anyone else, I do not know all the things that I do, or that I have done or will do. I am just Khajiit, my desert only looks different; it acts just the same as yours. All that any of the bodies who live up here can do is tell others we are all powerful and all knowing so you can believe it. The truth is that we are not. We make mistakes. We do things we shouldn't. Some of us even refuse to accept anything that isn't what we already know and admire. The only reason we are considered greater beings is because you let both us and yourselves think that."

"Do not hate the Ada. They don't even have a choice. If you should feel anything for them it should be pity. They are chained and bound to all that they know. It is why they value the prisoned so much, they find a similar spirit. That is why we are so special. Fadomai was bound to her nature; and her children were bound to what she desired them to be. But we are whatever we choose to be. We were made to walk so that we could realise we were able to do so. That is why Alkosh has wings, so that even if his legs are chained to Nirni he may glide across as he desires. It is why Khenarthi flys so high. It is why Hermorah sinks so low."

"Are we bound to the moons? Or are the moons just friends giving aid? It has been a mistranslation for a very long time. Just how bound are we? Were we ever forced to pray or drink or bathe? Did they ever take us and blind our eyes in sugar?"

"That is a story for children. Even you didn't learn it's message and you have grown so much. Have you come here to listen and not learn once again?"

"Here is the last lesson of this form of today: you are free; you shackled yourself; you should not disdain them, but will do so anyway; you must keep walking, though you must rest; you will work until exhaustion, but lie as casually as the morning canes; you will see until blind
and be blind until the light will let you see. The nature of the world is a maze. Cheating only angers those foolish enough to stick to the rules they never needed to listen to in the first place. Winners make up the rules. That's the only rule that matters."

"Thijja. I like that name. Wait until we die, then we shall meet again."
