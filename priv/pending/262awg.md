3E20      
Day 12, Cycle A

We cannot see the Moons or Nirn anymore. He-Who-Reads has identified a blue speck as Nirn, but if it were not for the color it would just be another star. 

He-Who-Reads and have been talking about their respective pasts. It isn't a topic I'm very interested in, personally, but we're going to be stuck together for however long this takes, so... it's good to make good relationships between us. I just hope that no conflicts arise because of this. I don't think that they will, but, I am wary of any threat to the mission. As long as we're all civil (and we are all friendly enough) no tensions should arise.

I prefer Llevan's talk. He's been going over the way the mana tracings from the Sigil Stones have been reacting to our departure from Nirn. The pressure spells have also had to undergo small fine tuning, but that was expected. It seems our gravity equations were right. 

Divines protect us.

Signed,
