3E20      
Day 14, Cycle C

We got new supplies today. Two weeks into our mission, and we've seen so much. So little is understood though. I had send back a list of supplies for next week, as I think we have enough time to run a few experiments. 

I also formally asked for a Histcarp in a bowl, for He-Who-Reads. He told me that he was touched by my gesture of friendship and concern. Thankfully, the others did not seem irritated that I did not ask for similar items for them. Llevan is too straight forward in his passion for the study of the Aurbis, so I didn't think he would. however, I was not sure of. All is well though.

I've been given a list of minor medical procedures to try out, and the tools necessary to do them. After two weeks, I wonder if we've changed at all? I don't think that we have. I'm fairly certain I've stayed at the same weight, anyways. Hm. Perhaps some exercise on the observation deck is in order. 

Divines protect us.

Signed,
