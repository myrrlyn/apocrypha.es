3E20     
Day 15, Cycle C

The daedric plane we're in has been increasing the intensity of its assault. A net of lightning currently surrounds the ship, and is applying constant pressure. Occasionally a spear, or tendril, will come out of the fog and smack against the wards. 

So far, the wards have held, but our soul gems are losing power quickly. Only a few more cycles until the wards fall. I'd like to wager that this record will never be found, but stranger things have happened. 

Divines protect us.

Signed,
