**Introductions to Your Guides**

You’ve come this far, so I suppose it is only fair I tell you about yours truly and my allies. 


**Varasieth**

I am Varasieth, the Spirit of Discovery, Exploration, and Piracy. I am the Pirate Philosopher at the helm of the Eversail, the capital ship of our fleet. With gilded ships and sails shining as pearl, we are always on an eternal journey through the World River. 

This is our Golden Voyage. We travel through every current and every branch as we please, never fearing lostness because being lost is just another adventure. Not that we could be lost! With Prismata, my beloved spyglass, I can see into every world that ever existed. Ours is not a tyrannical fleet. Each and every Spirit has a say in where we go next. We plunder and gather treasure from our many travels, both as mementos and as promises of the future. I bid everyone I cross paths with to heed the call of adventure. Come join our Golden Voyage, and you will never know boredom again.   

 **Nagrom Meferan**

Nagrom Meferan is the Spirit of Exposition, Translation, and Mediation. His “Plane of Oblivion”, as you would call it, is Hatlastad. Also known as the Gallery of Maps, it is a museum containing images of nearly anything or anywhere you desire to see in this particular Branch of the World River. Nagrom chooses not to wear a physical form. Instead, he manifests his presence as a loud disembodied voice. Rumor has it that the lesser creatures who enter his realm are haunted by his voice for all eternity, as he narrates their daily lives. He frequently invites disputing parties to his Gallery in an attempt to solve their conflict. Though he was unwilling to leave his Plane of Oblivion to join us, we remain “friends”, or at least that is the closest approximation to the mortal equivalent of our relationship.

We are the primary guides to your journey, but there are also many lesser Spirits that have joined in our mission. These are what you would call “Lesser Daedra”, similar to the Dremora. Foremost among my companions are the Silver Swashbucklers. Like myself, they carry hearts yearning for adventure and will never hesitate to explore an unknown realm. The Golden Galleons themselves are the works of Spirits binding Creatia to themselves. In this way, we can each take our Plane of Oblivion with us wherever we go.

 These may be the most thematic of my companions, but we have recruited many Sailors from many different Branches and Currents. Once upon a time, several of the “Dremora” joined my cruise in the hope for stronger opponents. The darkened Swordsman-Sailors from distant Shores also joined my voyage, though they tend to be more ephemeral than the other Sailors. Refugees from many a dying Current have also joined my cruise in the hopes of finding a new home. As far as I am concerned, so long as you have a heart for adventure, anyone is welcome in our Fleet. 

Now that I have told you about myself, it is time I tell you about some of the Planes of Oblivion that you have never heard of before.

**The Courts of Sred Toc**

Sred Toc is the Spirit of Radical Justice, Idealism, and Hypocrisy. His Realm of Oblivion is a massive Courthouse containing billions of courtrooms. The Courts are always in session, as the Spirits his Daedra hunt down are constantly being put on trial for trumped-up charges that Sred felt they deserved for their “wrongdoings”. Beneath his Courthouse is a massive prison complex designed to contain virtually any Spirit trapped inside. 

Sred believes his methods provide justice to victims who would never have had closure otherwise. Wherever a perceived injustice takes place, he is quick to respond and attempt to deliver his own brand of vigilante justice, regardless of the cost to himself. His powers are limited, however, and his ability to enforce his arbitrary laws is thus restricted. 

This doesn’t stop him from trying to punish people who are far above his weight class. He has frequently dueled with Nocturnal and her ilk during his many attempts to arrest them for their crimes on the innocents in Mundus. It is rumored, however, that his real target is Akatosh and the Aedra. He has accused them of murdering Lorkhan, and feels very strongly that they ought to be brought to justice. It is unlikely that he actually has a personal reason for his pursuit of Lorkhan’s killer. More likely, he is simply doing it to be faithful to his ideals. This stubborn refusal to accept reality has resulted in numerous one-sided wars between the Ur-Dra and his own servants. He has failed to break her Wall of Night to this day. 

He employs a sect of Spirits known as the Enforcers, a group just as dedicated to their ideals as Sred Toc is. They faithfully obey his orders to hunt down and arrest any Spirit that he issues a warrant for. He gives each of his servants a badge imbued with some of his own power and keeps a gavel capable of unknown feats. 

Sred Toc frequently claims that he supports everyone following their own ideals, but his actions conflict with this sentiment as he tends to issues warrants for anyone that conflicts with his own. He has pursued my Fleet many times in the past, but we have always managed to escape. I consider him to be something of a nemesis.
