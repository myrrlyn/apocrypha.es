So I was running down a rabbit-hole researching Sotha Sil and Azura for my *Gender in Tamrielic Faith* series; I found myself re-reading the Five Songs of King Wulfarth and the Secret song over and over when something occurred to me that was not at all related to my essay.

The Heart Chamber could possibly be the Cave that is the Stone of Snow-Throat.  A Stone within a Stone, so to speak (Red Mountain's Stone inside the Heart Chamber).

The hints are in the [Secret Song](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/secret-song-wulfharth-ash-king):

&gt; And Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) said: “I do not wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for the reasons that the Tribunal might believe I do. Nevertheless, it is true that they will die by my hand...

So Shorkhan was not so concerned with his power being tapped, it was not about that.  Maybe Earthbones are used to having their powers tapped.

&gt; ...Many Nords could not bring themselves to ally with their traditional enemies, even in the face of Red Mountain. They were close to desertion. Then Wulfharth said: “Don't you see where you really are? Don't you know who Shor really is? Don't you know what this war is?” And they looked from the King to the God to the Devils and Orcs, and some knew, really knew, and they are the ones that stayed.

Tie this back to [Shor Son of Shor](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/shor-son-shor-full):  this is the Awful Fighting.  The Arena.

Every Tower is an echo of Ada-mantia, I love the idea of each [Tower being a story](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/268egs/a_theory_on_the_mechanics_of_towers/), and each Tower is telling a variation of Creation, Convention, the Awful Fighting.  It tells the story in the context of the local culture.

In this situation, however, it would make sense that the fate of Snow-Throat would be intimately tied to Red Mountain, given one's relationship to Kyne, and the other's relationship to Shorkhan.

This ties to my pet theory, of which some of you are aware, that the origin of the Nords came from when the Heart was shot from Ada-Mantia across to Red Mountain, Kyne was grief-stricken and chased after her husband's heart, when halfway she came upon some Wanderers up on the Throat of the World, and realised the purpose for Shor's sacrifice, and decided not to chase after the past, but to pick up his sword and carry on the battle, as a War-Wife would and should do.  So she Shouts the Wanderers all the way to Atmora to shape them into the Nords, also because she had always wanted children.

So the stories of the Nords, the Chimer/Dunmer and the Dwemer are all branches of the same narrative, that just split off at different po9ints, but reconverge at Red Mountain in the Heart Chamber.

I posit that Snow-Throat Tower was de-activated when Red Mountain erupted in 4E 5.

In other semi-substantiated conjectures, I am beginning to think that Nerevar mantled Trinimac at Red Mountain, and thus was destined to die because the concept of Trinimac ended when Boethiah consumed him, which is why Nerevar dying is the one of very few constants at Red Mountain.  This is also why Shorkhan refers to Nerevar as the Son of Boethiah in the Secret Song.  Shorkhan knows what is going on, he has seen it played out countless times.

Perhaps Dumac mantles Malacath, hence the confusing mention in the Secret Song, the Champion of his people cum Pariah as he is made a fool by Kagrenac and folded into a Walking World Refusal nonetheless.

And does this mean the entire time the Anticipations were trying to recreate the moment of Convention by manipulating all these little people into place?  Boethiah and Azura forming the frame, and the Webspinner Mephala quietly weaving it all together?

To what purpose? Landfall, C0DA, Jubal and Vivec.  The child of Sotha Sil.  Even Azura's "childish" behaviour (which will feature in the Gender essay, so I shan't discuss it here), just using her own nature towards the end goal.  No wonder Vivec was so resentful and angry.  No one likes to feel used, especially not users.

So those are my sunny Saturday thoughts and interpretations.  This totally just popped into my head today, if you guys don't like it, I can go on proselytizing my previous theory about it being Blackreach.  :D
