3E20    
Day 18, Cycle B

We've escaped. Llevan and took the resonation of the Emperor's shout, the one that got us moving so quickly, and contained it. He-Who-Reads and I guided them through reshaping the vibrations into a new word, which is too low in tone for any of our ears to hear. It means "foundation lost," or at least something similar. 

It had the intended effect. The daedric realm shook and cracks formed in it. He-Who-Reads and I pointed the ship toward the closest one, leading again into Oblivion, and Llevan got the Sigil Stones working again in the mean time. We got out of there as quickly as possible. 

The daedric ship is still alive, or at least I must believe it to be. It was ripping into pieces when it disappeared again. For the safety of the crew, I will assume that we are now in constant danger. 

What makes all of this worse is that we're moving so slowly. Without the Emperor's shout, I don't know how we'll be able to continue the voyage. Akatosh is so far... and now Nirn is too. 

Divines protect us.

Signed,
