&gt;#A Pocket Guide to Skyrim and Its Environs: Hjaalmarch, Third Edition
&gt;Being a Description of the Hold
&gt;
&gt;and the Divers Customs of the Inhabitants
&gt;
&gt;and furthermore a useful history of this place
&gt;
&gt;of interest by Nature of its
&gt;
&gt;Culture and History.
&gt;
&gt;Dedicated
&gt;
&gt;To the unswerving Commitment to Land and Brethren
&gt;
&gt;of Their Most Commanding Majesties Emperor Uriel Septim VII and High King Torbarik Wolf-Arm
&gt;
&gt;Promulgated under the Authority of the Imperial Geographical Society and the Scribes of Windhelm
&gt;
&gt;3E 411

For the glory of the Fatherland this has been written, and with the end of the Moot and the crowning of the new High King this guide has been requested to be inscribed by not only the Emperor of Tamriel but also Torbarik himself. The first edition and various installments of A Pocket Guide to Skyrim and its Environs have long since fallen out of favor and are in much need of a rewriting, having been originally scribed back during the beginning years of the Third Empire, which is commonly known as the coming reign of Talos Stormcrown, who united the eight provinces of Tamriel into a nation of peace and prosperity.

With the combined efforts of the Scribes of Windhelm and the Imperial Geographic Society, this guide will inform the northern traveler of one of the many regions of Skyrim, and the birthplace of High King Torbarik in his new years as enacting ruler of all Skyrim.

####Foreword
The First Edition to the A Pocket Guide to Skyrim and Its Environs, Hjaalmarch was released along with the other volumes of its series in the latter years of the Second Era, commissioned by Emperor Tiber Septim in the year 285 to document the various regions of the province of Skyrim in a similar way the newly released  A Pocket Guide to the Empire and its Environs, First Edition did so for the entirety of Tamriel.^1 Tiber believed that the people of his growing Empire needed to know the histories and people of their border-natives in full detail, and thus over one thousand copies of the book was sold to the public.

The success of these guides (which spawned similar versions for the other provinces) brought surprise adoration to the Empire, resulting in the new Septim Dynasty to be congratulated by the people as a whole. However, the Imperial Geographic Society neglected from releasing new revisions to these guides and soon confusion arose amongst the people of other provinces as they traveled expecting sights and descriptions long since outdated. Some other organizations^2 attempted to create new guides, to various degrees of success.

The Second Edition of A Pocket Guide to Skyrim and Its Environs, Hjaalmarch has been banned by the Imperial Geographic Society for viewing by the citizenry of Tamriel for grammatical issues as well as faulty scholarship and radical ideals.^3

With new changes in both Tamriel and Skyrim in the recent years of the Third Era, the Emperor has requested that a new series of Skyrim-centric pocket guides be written and published to educate the common Tamrielian about the different landscapes and peoples of the realms of our unified land^4 , and of course the IGS was called upon again to write it. Much of the propagandistic tone for Skyrim has been removed^5, and more in-depth views into each of the Holds have been both added and updated.

Now, let us begin with the true history of Hjaalmarch, and its founding as a hold of Skyrim.

**Editors Note by Eis Vuur Warden:**
At the request of Emperor Uriel Septim VII and High King Torbarik Wolf-Arm I have agreed upon annotating and inserting certain sections within this pocket guide before final approval for print. I suppose I should be grateful for this opportunity to work on a project this grand, but I must confess that I find it bland and to easy for my tastes. Nevertheless, I hope these notes (which there shall be few if any at all; like I said, I find this task boring) aid the younger members of the Imperial Geographic Society and show them how true scholarly research is professionally done. Enjoy.

^4. ^Tamriel ^is ^unified? ^Since ^when ^exactly? ^Someone ^needs ^to ^reedit ^this.

^5. ^Minotaur ^crap ^and ^you ^all ^know ^it, ^but ^I ^suppose ^this ^can ^stay ^in. ^A ^little ^propaganda ^can ^go ^a ^long ^way ^and ^be ^useful ^in ^the ^outcome, ^you ^know.
