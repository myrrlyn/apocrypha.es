3E20       
Day 20, Cycle A

What is a shooting star? Was the orange and blue ball of light a shooting star? Today, I was on the observation deck and noticed a streak of blue traveling between the stars. He-Who-Reads confirms my equations; it was traveling faster than anything we've ever seen, save light from Aetherius. The ball of light we saw earlier disappeared from sight when it went behind the moons, but this blue streak has no where to hide and is traveling across the stars, instead of into them, from our perspective.

By mapping it's location against the constellations, we were able to obtain it's speed. A full report is being written by He-Who-Reads. I'm writing a full account of our manipulation of the shout, and including an (I hope) impassioned plea that will get us moving forward again. 

Divines protect us.

Signed,
