3E20       
Day 20, Cycle A

The blue streak is still there, against the stars. We're tracking it. 

opened the portal, and the first thing to go through was my report and a piece of paper that I wrote as big as possible, "READ NOW." At the end of the provisioning, we ~~recie~~ received a note back that said that said they would contact us in three days, to be ready then for another portal. 

In the meantime, He-Who-Reads finally got his Histcarp. He set it in his room, a blue pearl against the quasi-darkness. Poetry aside we'll have to cycle water for it. He-Who-Reads has decorated the round tank with some feathers, though why I don't know why. It looks nice, though, so maybe that's all the reason he needs.

I wonder what they'll do to get us going forward. 

Divines protect us. 

Signed,
