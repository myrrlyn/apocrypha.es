3E20      
Day 24, Cycle A

They started the summons rather early, for us anyways. We've been given a circular frame, that is quite literally humming with power. An empty circle within a circle, and threaded lines connecting them in a criss-cross pattern. The threads are what hum. It is my understanding that this object contains the shout of the Emperor.

We've been told to put on our void suits and to attach it to the rear of the ship, and to get back inside before giving it a good shake. We have also been told not to trip while holding it. 

Can you imagine? What would happen if we did? I told Llevan to prepare suits for and I. We'll go out and attach this thing as best as we're able to. 

The blue streak is still visible. If it is some sort of Aedra, I hope that it is sending us blessings. 

Divines protect us.

Signed,
