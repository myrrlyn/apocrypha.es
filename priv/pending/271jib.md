3E20      
Day 24, Cycle B

It's a curious thing, to be outside of ... what I suppose I'll call logic. The natural order. Order in general, unless it is the force of mind and personality that creates order. I turned to thinking about He-Who-Reads and his fish ... says I was half fish, half lizard for a moment. How I held onto the shout holder, I do not know. 

Despite the sight of tendrils forming off shoulders, or color fading in and out of my own vision, or all of the other things we saw, we managed to attach the holder to the backside of the ship. 

After getting inside and making sure we had our proper shapes (I think my ears are a bit bigger? Is forehead ... longer?) I had Llevan give the wards a quick flux. That got us moving very quickly. I'm surprised, and humbled, by the Emperor's power. 

Onward to Akatosh.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
