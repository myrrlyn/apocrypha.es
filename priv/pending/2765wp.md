Day 25, Cycle A

It is confirmed. My ears are a little longer. I want to test if this is because the last thing I was looking at while in the void was the back of head, or if if it is because I didn't keep my shape together properly. I can not think of any safe way to test this though. 

I checked the vitals of everyone in the crew. We're all perfectly healthy, though we've also all lost a little bit of weight. This was expected, without being held down as rigorously as we were on Nirn, so I'm not worried. 

The blue streak is still in sight. I wonder if we might see other color variations the further we get away from Nirn. 

On that note, I think I might have figured out a way to make sure we are not caught by surprise again by any Daedric entity. I will have to confer with Llevan.

Divines protect us.

Signed,
