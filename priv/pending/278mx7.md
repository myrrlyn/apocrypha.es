3E20      
Day 26, Cycle C

Llevan thinks we can rig a sigil stone to a floating ball apparatus. He says we'll need some metal springs in order to make it stay steady. While I think that a crystal lining would work best, he suggested making use of mana saturated water. It's cheaper and though it might not work as ~~efficently~~ efficiently, we're making a permanent addition to the ship. 

So far the blue streak is still visible. I had He-Who-Reads flash lights at it in a synchronized pattern for a few hours, but no response yet. Which may be for the best.

Divines protect us.
