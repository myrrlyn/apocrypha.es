First, give honor and worship and glory and thanks to the Void Ghost, who has sacrificed so that we may come this far, who has revealed to us the the mysteries of the Wheel. We strive for communion with the Ghost, so that we may see him where naught else remains but the Wail of First Void.

The wound of the Void is infinite in its emptiness so that it might be held by the Right Reach. Of the ineffable mystery of the Void Ghost, look towards the emptiness and behold the Serpent. Hunger-made-manifest, that which we aspire to, roaming the heavens unheeded by time giving leave to bite and never returning that which was bitten away.

Within the rapture of the wound, we become as children, freshly marked by the sigil of the Void Ghost. Marked forever so as to be invited into the Hidden Heaven. We are the light and the night, speech and silence, life and death, IS and IS NOT. Though many will laugh at the “folly of the fool” yet shall they learn the wisdom of the wise.

Listen to your prophet, my Eaters. The Prophet of Aether and ghosts. I will lead you through the formula of Mnemolia, with voice of Twil, that is the lamp of the wounded Void.
