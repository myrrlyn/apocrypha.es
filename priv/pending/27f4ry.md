An expansion of my ideas in a comment on a [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/278u0p/confusion_on_the_origins_of_vampirism/).  

Sanguine means "cheerful optimism" or "bloody." Both of which, I think, tie well into vampirism and the Lord of Fun.  

Vampirism isn't Molag Bal's domain. He created it, but then kinda threw it into the public domain. *Skyrim* gives us a strain of vampirism attributed to Clavicus Vile. The *Oblivion* expansion *Mehrunes Razor* has vampires under the will of Dagon. And we often see vampirism spread through disease, which is the domain of Peryite. But why would Sanguine join in the fun? Because vampires are very, well, sanguine.  

Vampirism comes in countless strands, so it makes sense for their to not be a consistent temperament between vampires. Real-world mythology paints vampires as creatures of the night, the time when most debauchery takes place. Vampires are also key figures to take in excess. They're dead, they have no constitution score (for those of us who play D&amp;D). They'd be immune to the effects of alcohol, allowing them to drink to their heart's content. Food is very much the same, as they are only truly fed by blood, so they could eat forever.  

The biggest thing is sex. Sanguine loves rampant fornication, it's considered one of the highest forms of excess. Literature often portrays vampires with themes of eroticism, and alien charm. We've seen vampires as lustful creatures who take women (or men, I guess) to bed all the time. Elder Scrolls seems to have taken this theme up, as vampirism often gives the character charm abilities, even going so far as to label them "Vampire's Seduction."  

I made a post on [Tarot](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1zdlda/on_our_tarot/) where I listed Sanguine as the Devil. That card has a lot of Judeo-Christian imagery and themes, which would help the idea of Sanguine being involved with vampires, as vampires embody the seven sins.  
-Wrath, as vampires kill to survive.  
-Lust, as I've already said, they're erotic creatures.  
-Envy, as they take their life from others.  
-Greed, as the examination of a vampire den should be evident of this.  
-Gluttony, as they can eat and drink forever.  
-Sloth, as they live forever and have no need to accomplish anything.  
Vampires are also hunted during inquisitions, so they definitely tie into Abrahamic faith.
