For some reason, some of you seem to think that Aedric Plane(t)s can now simultaneously be Daedric Princes. I would have thought the patent lunacy of such a statement would speak for itself, but apparently not.

To recap:

&gt;*The Thirty-Six Lessons of Vivec: Sermon Three*

&gt;A Dwemer said, 'We Dwemer are only aspirants to this that the Velothi have. They shall be our doom in this and the eight known worlds, NIRN, LHKAN, RKHET, THENDR, KYNRT, AKHAT, MHARA, and JHUNAL.' The secret to doom is within this Sermon.

In this Sermon, Vivec recounts a Dwemer listing the Planets of Mundus. RKHET is the important one here - in addition to Nirn, and excluding Dibella and Zenithar for reasons that are presently irrelevant, *Arkay is listed as one of the Dominion Planets of the Aedra.* That would make his Aedric nature beyond debate, right? Dear God, I hope so.

&gt;*16 Accords of Madness, v. XII*

&gt;It was here that Sheogorath performed certain rites that summoned Malacath, and the two Daedric Lords held court in the presence of the disfigured corpse.

In this Accord, Malacath and Sheogorath are clearly considered to be Daedric equals. Malacath, as everyone *should* know, is the Daedric Prince of the spurned and ostracized, created from the reanimated dung that was Trinimac after his consumption by Boethiah shortly before the Velothi Exodus. That no other Prince 'accepts' him as a 'true' Daedroth is both appropriate to his sphere and rather hypocritical in a few cases. 

After all, Mehrunes Dagon was the Leaper Demon King, Molag Bal was the Ruddy Man, King of the Dreughs, Sheogorath was a prisoner in the Imperial City, and Meridia was a Magne-Ge. If Malacath is not a 'true' Daedroth, then neither are they. Naturally, that's not true. *Non-Daedric entities can be transformed into Princes of Oblivion.* This is not up for debate.

However, none of that has mattered for some scholars who find the negation of Malacath's Daedric nature useful for their own purposes.

And what purposes are those? Well, apparently someone decided that Malacath the Daedric Prince of curses and Arkay the Dominion Plane(t) of burial rites are the same being.

As far as I can tell, these are their justifications.

&gt;*Varieties of Faith: The Nords*

&gt;Orkey (Old Knocker):

&gt;God of mortality, Orkey combines aspects of Mauloch and Arkay. He is a "loan-god" for the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of Atmora. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that "bound them to the count of winters." At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Then Shor showed up and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.

So Nords encountered the Aldmeri (Nordic for "automatically bad") concept of Arkay, anon Xarxes, who is responsible for recording the lives and histories of the Aldmer, and conflated him with Mauloch, God of Curses, in an attempt to make sense of the baffling lifespan discrepancies of Aldmer, Nords, and Orcs in one fell swoop. Note that this is solely the Nordic view; Altmer, Velothi, and Orsimer alike have no need for such a syncretism of Arkay and Malacath, and thus do not recognize it.

How can I be so sure that Xarxes is Arkay? Well, [there's a whole book about it.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/tuwhacca-arkay-xarxes)

&gt;*He is supposedly the keeper of the Bloody Curse which sounds an awful lot like mortality. His is the Ashpit, and ashes in TES are usually associated with Death*

Ashes are *always* associated with death. The Bloody Curse was the transformation of Aldmer into Orsimer, not the universal notion of 'death'. There is simply no support for this connection anywhere.

In conclusion, Arkay is the Imperial Aedroth of burial rites, who is connected to Xarxes, the Scribe of the Aldmer, and from this mythopoeic kinship, and a spot of poor spelling, the Nords of Atmora conflated 'Arkay the elven death god' with 'Mauloch the orcish god of curses', with the ingeniously idiotic term of 'Orkey'. From this, some *esteemed* scholars decided that Arkay and Malacath (and thus Trinimac) are all the same thing. 

Never mind the fact that Xarxes and Trinimac are *both* listed, side-by-side, [in all Aldmeri pantheons.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/varieties-faith-high-elves) 

Never mind the fact that the planet RKHET exists within Mundus while Ashpit exists within Oblivion. 

Such discrepancies apparently don't matter anymore.
