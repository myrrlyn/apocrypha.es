3E20      
Day 28, Cycle B

Provisioning came and went without much issue. I put in a request for the metal springs necessary to make the sensor. I was also given a bit of a reprimand. Aside from taking our vitals, I haven't done any of the experiments I was supposed to do. Even that wasn't for the Empire, but because I was concerned about our reaction to the Void. 

I will have to remind the others to finish their reports. We've had a crazy month, yes, but we've had enough off days for them to do their jobs. I don't know what's the hold up. 

Divines protect us. 

Signed,
