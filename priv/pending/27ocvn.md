When the Tiger-Dragon roars, the ensuing torrent and monsoon wind bring with them the great changes.  In the Dragon Land the peasants call this the deep-slithering.  Wise serpents find good hiding spots when the East wind blows.

In more civilized times, scholars had termed this event an "Aka Veine".  When Tosh-Raka bores of intrigue or the dance of battle, he breathes his fury into the heavens.  The thunder, rain, and wind which follow always bear upon the land heavily to remake it.

The fury returns Akavir to earlier times, but those who survive the winds remember the later times.  This phenomenon does not seem to exist on Tamriel.

A word then to the Expeditionary Blade-Nests - do not fear the blizzards, torrents, and ash clouds of this land.  Yes, there are natural hazards, but no, there is no dragon powerful to call us back to the earlier time.

It is known that Tamrielics do not understand the phenomenon they call weather.  Do not bother lengthy interrogations over it.

The do not know that the blizzard is a static over the world's song.  That the rain and wind are two songs fighting for prominence.  That the lightning in the sky are conquering histories clashing and ripping against each others' might.  They do not see the she serpents mending the wounds, or mother Kyne whispering her guidance to them.

These phenomena are common in Tamriel, as common as conquest, battle, and chaos.  The Tamrielic fetish with towers, once thought of as a joke back East, is real enough.  Their crude imprinting on history, the true science and art of it, is lost to these.  Perhaps the Son of the Dragon will understand.

In any event, should the expeditionary forces not believe this report, have their tonal magister dance the harmony of the tower.  Yes, it's archaic, but effective.  Dance the harmony, and attune to this land's tower - the tall Mountain of snow, and the Red Mountain of ash.  You cannot mistake them.  Attune to either, and listen to the song.  The weather and the tower song will be in harmony.  There is your proof.  These torrents and blizzards are no Aka Veii.

Return to the task.

In so many years hencepast, at the time of Tsaescence, we nearly had our victory over Tosh Raka.  Then, the Red Diamoned Son of the Dragon came from the West.  With his legions he attacked from the one side, while Tosh Raka attacked from the other.  The fury of the Akavir's Elder Serpents was nothing compared to the Young and Bloody Dragons of Ur-El of the Fifth Turning.

Then came the Aka Veine.  Tosh Raka shouted these chirping hordes back into their past - our future - and out of Akavir.  It was a threat even he had no patience attending to.  We prepared henceforth, our total Tsaescence beyond us now.  

With each dragon we killed, that was one fewer of the eternal beasts that would aid Ur-El here in Tamriel.  But each dragon killed in Tamriel is one fewer to hamper our forebears during the time of trouble.

But our goal is this Son of the Dragon.  This mysterious blessed stranger who stirred even Tosh Raka's indifference.  If we, as the final destiny of our kind, survive to enable the ascension of this being to power on Tamriel, perhaps our victory against the Tigers will not have eluded us.

The monsoon from the east, the Aka Veine, shall have to contend with the hurricane from the west.  We shall call it the Aka Po.
