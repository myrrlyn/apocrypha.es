A [sestina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sestina#Form) about King Lysandus. The sestina originated in medieval Aquitaine, so it seemed the perfect form for a Breton bard.

Hearken the tale of royal blood  
Most fouly spilt, and of th' unrest  
That from the grave summons the ghost  
Of Old Lysandus; the late king,  
Slyly fell'd by Orken dagger,  
[Clamours "Revenge!" in Daggerfall.](http://images.uesp.net/5/57/DF-Lysandus_Ghost.png)

His ghostly host, after night-fall,  
Such grave fright spread, to curdle blood,  
Pursuing by spectral dagger.  
From Daggerfall unto Wayrest,  
Sentinels nightly spy the king  
From death return'd, [an accurs'd ghost.](https://marnielangeroodiblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/ghost-2a2b80q.jpg)

Lysandus, 'fore he gave up ghost,  
And was yet king of Daggerfall,  
A great host led against the king  
Of Sentinel. They shed much blood  
O'er Beton Isle, sowing unrest,  
In Iliac Bay, [at drawn dagger.](http://images.uesp.net/2/26/Lore-Daggerfall_History.gif)  

---

Before Cryngaine, sharp'ning dagger,  
The field a-mist, thick as a ghost,  
Each knight prepares, lays lance in rest,  
[Ready for war, in line they fall.](http://images.uesp.net/9/94/Lore-Arena_History.gif)  
Yet, that day's battle's first-shed blood  
Cours'd blue through the veins of the king.

The hidden truth of the late king  
Is riddled with cloak-and-dagger;  
[A secret writ in royal blood,](http://studymacbeth.wikispaces.com/file/view/113.jpg/232009164/113.jpg)  
Whisper'd quietly, as a ghost.  
Let naught of it in wrong ears fall  
Lest ye likewise be laid to rest:

Crafty [Lord Woodborne of Wayrest](http://elderscrolls.net/img/daggerfall/portraits/L50s.jpg)  
Arranged for [Orcs to slay the king:](http://images.uesp.net/c/c2/Lore-Battlespire_History.gif)  
The foulest fate e'er to befall  
A royal soul. Hack'd by dagger,  
Crush'd by club. Buried, in cold blood,  
Unblest. Thus curs'd, awoke the ghost.

O, RESTLESS CURSE OF DAGGERFALL!  
TO SEAL [THE TOMB OF THE KING'S GHOST](http://home.comcast.net/~mjonesgraphics/Dagawake.JPG)   
CAUSE THOU TO FALL THE TRAITOR'S BLOOD.
