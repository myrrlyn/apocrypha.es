&gt; So here's all my hopes and aspirations  
Nothing But Puke  
God, I'm So Lonely...  

-Strapping Young Lad (Detox)  

There is much to learn from solitude. Malacath is the friend to the friendless that propels us into greatness.  

The patron of pariahs is more influential than my previous two subjects, so there wasn't as much digging and conjecture to do. However, the focus here is on what he does for us, not his history, so don't expect a simple summary.  

Malacath is the patron deity of the Orsimer, the people who best know loneliness and expulsion. Yet, despite the many historical accounts of them being stomped on and plundered, they continue to strive and persevere. The Orsimer are a strong people, and a testament to what Malacath's lessons give us.  

Malacath represents solitude, perseverance, and the Sworn Oath.  

&gt; **Solitude**  

A powerful force (and city). In some respects, solitude represents focus, and meditation. By oneself, he or she can think, and train. The man with a strong will is not weakened by his deprivation of contact, he embraces it and owns it.  

Even forced solitude, from expulsion, can be of benefit. Friends and valuables are weaknesses. An enemy will strike you at where you are weakest. Just look at villains from books and television and the like. Who did they attack, Spiderman, or Mary Jane? Batman, or Gotham? Connections make you weak. The man with nothing to lose cannot be harmed. Malacath teaches us strength through invincibility. Friends die, items are stolen and broken, all outside of your power. But your self will not break until you allow it. Malacath reminds us to always look out for number one.  

Malacath himself spurns his "allies." He is often believed to not be an actual Daddroth, and one of his artifacts, the Scourge, banishes Daedra.

Also, does "sensory deprivation" sound familiar around here? The ultimate form of solitude, losing connection to the universe. Think about it.  

&gt; **Perseverance**  

Malacath reminds us that defeat is only a push to improve. Failure is always an option. Shit happens. Failure is only problematic when you let it defeat you. Failure merely means that option did not work, or that approach was flawed. Work, try something new. Even nature allows failure to happen, and modifies itself based off of what did and did not work.  

Strength comes from dominating failure. Revel in your mistakes. The Orsimer embody this. Their homes are sacked all the time, and nearly everyone hates them. But they continue to survive. The Orsimer do not complain about their misfortunes, they only look forward and push on.  

Malacath tests the Dunmer for physical weakness in his position in the House of Troubles. He reminds them to be physically strong, so their enemies cannot defeat them.  

&gt; **The Sworn Oath**  

Now what could this be? If I'm missing something obvious  please correct me (myrrlyn, please), cuz it's conjecture time.  

Victims don't bully each other. Malacath preaches a silent bond between the friendless of simply leaving each other alone. Teamwork would deny solitude, and predation would fall under another's sphere (probably Hircine or Bal). Malacath tells us to merely leave each other alone. Were everyone to keep to themselves, the world would be a nicer place.  

&gt; **Conclusion**  

Malacath is a rather simple one that I figured I would write in my bored state. He reminds us that it's completely okay to be alone, and that not having friends is an advantage (that's why I'm so strong).  

&gt; There's nobody  
I can rerate to  
Feer rike a bird in a cage  
It's kinda sihry  
But not rearry  
Because it's fihring my body with rage
