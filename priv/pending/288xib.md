Thunder died down in the Spectator's mind. Before him was nothing. Blackness.

The voice of torment awoke in his mind.

"You may change the path, but the destination is always the same. Know your limits, lest you commit the Over-Sin, the Progenitor of the Sinful, the Poison of All. The Sin of Pride."

The Spectator attempted to speak, but was cut off.

"You now dream in my very heart, your mind is truly mine and yours. One, and the same. Know which one controls this dream. I do."

Blackness gave weight, as the Spectator landed on nothingness. Ten paces from him was the Weaver of Dreams herself. Sixteen feet tall with sixteen limbs, with sixteen weapons in each of her sixteen hands, clothed in Daedric script, adorned with a crown of screams and torment was the Prince of Dreams and Omens.

The Spectator was naked, with the form of a brilliant yellow silhouette of a human, eight feet tall. He took a step forward, and the voice of torment met him.

"Know the Sin of Pride, for you believe you can end this."
He took another step forward, limping this time.

"Know the Sin of Weakness, for you will never take the final step." He took another step forward, but fell as his foot rose.

"Know the Sin of Malcontent, for you seek to end this beautiful dream." He attempted to rise, but he only shifted forward.

"Know the Sin of Betrayal, because the Eight and One abandoned your fellow Ada." The Spectator put his hands to head, and screamed.

Vaermina laughed as torment was fulfilled. The Spectator continued pulling and out came his Head and Spine. Vaermina stopped laughing. The Spectator rose on the Head-Spine.

"Know the Sin of Betrayal, because the Implement abandoned you." The Spectator limped forward on the Head-Spine.

"Know the Sin of Malcontent, for you sought to keep this dream whole." Vaermina stepped forward, her sixteen limbs arrayed against the limping figure.

"Know the Sin of Weakness, for you will never prevent the final step." Vaermina slashed, thrust, spat, flamed, shot, and struck against the shadow in the dream.

"Know the Sin of Pride, for you're a dream that is not. You may change the path, but the destination is always the same." Vaermina ceased. The Skull of Corruption laid at her feet, next to it a rose.
