***Author's note***- *After the esteemed scholar Quintillius Trebates was taken to the asylum in Torval, his house in the Forum of Saint Martin and its contents were sold off to the Umbranox Dynasty of County Anvil. Count Falcedon Umbranox was kind enough to donate the unwanted tomes from Trebates Manor to the Imperial Library, and the transcription below is one such tome that Quintillius had written before his detention. The Imperial Library has rejected the generous offer from Scribe Trebates to have many copies of the tome available to the citizens of the City stating it is further evidence of his descent into madness* - ***Pius Cervantes.***

Historians often have a funny way of distorting events; like the rise of Hialto-Arlibiea from a small mining village in County Cheydinhal to declaring himself Tiber Celediil and placing his posterior upon the Ruby Throne, or the unheroic death of Cephorus II from a bloody nose.

This tome will detail the truth about Uriel VI's death, and not some romanticized version written to moisten the loins of some ditty Colovian noblewoman from Belene's Rest.

It is the 22nd of Last Seed in the 320th year of the Third Era, the year of Julianos. The Emperor returns to the Imperial City from a week out hunting in the Great Forest with his men. His Highness crosses the Imperial Bridge over Lake Rumare to the City Isle and offers to return all the horses to the stables. His men hesitate to let the Emperor do it all himself, but not wanting to upset him after such a successful hunt let him do it.

The Emperor has nearly put all the horses away, saving his own stallion, Tiber, for last. After feeding Tiber an apple, Uriel leads the horse in the stable but stops when he sees a small child sat on a bale of hay.

"Hello there young lady", says Uriel, "What is thou doing inside the Royal Stables?"

*"Forgive me, your Grace. I am but a poor girl who longs to own a fine stallion like your own one day. I would like but an hour to stay here and admire these fine beasts."*

The Emperor accepts the girl's request, and sits down on the bale of hay next to her and begins a conversation.

What they spoke about is unknown, but what happened next was detailled by the Bosmeri scholar Rondolin:
***

*....and the Emperor told the child her hour was up, which angered the young Colovian and she cast an abhorrent spell at Uriel. She watched him drop his breeches and began making love to his white stallion.* 

*His men, confused as to why it was taking the Emperor so long to stable the horses, entered the Royal Stables to see Uriel moving back and forth, traumatising Tiber. They saw a young girl maniacally laughing at the poor Emperor. Uriel's men, fearful she was possessed by a daedric spirit, slit her throat and tossed her lifeless body into Lake Rumare.*

*Although the girl was dead, the spell was still affecting Uriel. In an effort to stop the spell and end Tiber's misery, a blade pierced the white stallions skull and let it be at peace. Unfortunately, the spell was more powerful than they had thought it would be, and as soon as Uriel had removed himself from the dead horse, he had entered another. The guards, disgusted with what they were seeing, were left with a final resort, and pried him apart from the horse and beat him to death.*

*After disposing of Tiber's carcass, the men concoted a story amongst themselves that Uriel had died during the hunt after falling from his horse, and was trampled on by his spooked stallion.*
***

And there you have it my friend. Emperor Uriel Septim VI was not killed after falling from his horse, but was savagely beaten to death by his own men.
