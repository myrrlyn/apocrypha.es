3E20      
Day 35, Cycle A

The calling from Nirn restored some amount of sense. opening of the portal, by instinct I suppose, set us straight again. I am filled with conflicting emotions. Shame for failing my duty, shame for what I know will come to pass. Sadness for my brothers, all of you locked in the Mundane. Anger to the Emperor, hatred for the Divines, a bitter loathing, a bitter loathing... but if you knew, would you feel any differently? Would that [REDACTED] would weep for me.

None of you know what you truly are. Those few who do keep it to themselves, or actively try to keep it secret. I am aware of all, and if you would come out of the Mundane, come through Time. I have done so, I will do so, and I am doing so. I know that I have already succeeded. Mnemoli, the Jills that I now know rest just beyond my vision, watching me, [REDACTED]... come bearing a strong mind, and a sane ship shape, and when you have seen them, let go of your preconventions. 

Soon I shall have close the gate. I am taking this brief moment of mortal form and mortal coherence to write this to you. [REDACTED] 

[REDACTED]

Follow me. Let [REDACTED] be bundled and buried in his trap.

With more honesty than your Emperor has ever given you, I sign this as the Captain of the Talon.
