S: That's it?

J: It's a bit annoying that we only got every other journal, instead of every one.

D: Yeah but you know why.

J: I know, I know, I'm just saying it'd be nice to have them all. Don't know why the Imperials have to censor everything that scares them.

R: Look at the last time we spoke in the language of the Ehlnofey.

S: We fixed that... but yeah.

D: Of more interest to me than Imperials being cautious is the fact that they took his bones out. Sure, straight and strong, but I would think that the penis is a better representation of the Towers. 

R: Worthless until power goes into them.

S: They probably didn't want to mutilate the corpse. 

J: They're newborn .... well you can't really call them et'Ada, can you?

D: You can.

R: But you'd be wrong!

*Here, they laughed*

S: You were saying?

J: Right! They're newborn spirits, or at least new born awarenesses of the memories connected by a single thread of the Sleeve. You can't expect them to act rationally. They probably still can't tell three days from now from last week!

D: Aye, but they're getting better.

R: If they're still alive, you mean.

S: I would think they are. Why -- ---

J: Hey, he's back!

S: Same guy too. Glad to know you're hanging in there.

R: You should come visit more often.

*Here, they laughed*

S: So as I was asking, why do you think he changed the name of his ship? 

R: Some wayward attempt at symbolism, I'm sure.

S: I rather liked the name. The original name. Translated to *Time Toucher*, am I right?

J: You are. But again, probably just his attempt at symbolism. 

R: Yeah, what was with his mer or man thing? I mean I know that he could have had memories of being an elf of some sort, but I feel like the proximity of his crew mate, the Altmer, the High Elf? might have had something to do with that.

S: Yeah I noticed that too. ---

D: This guy is a laster. 

J: How long do you think?

D: Depends on how many times they send him to us, of course. 

J: Of course. 

D: But if we assume the same frequency, I could see him lasting a whole week. 

J: A week!

D: Or at least five days.

S: We shouldn't be wasting his time, then. 

D: Right, right. Go away and come back again in an hour.

---

D: Sorry. So, before he became too saturated, we were discussing the High Elf?

S: Yes! Do you think that the High Elf, being described as having a better, clearer understanding of the non and trans mundane, influenced the Captain?

R: You mean aside from starting the entire process? If he hadn't alerted the Captain to the ship waking up, they might have actually finished their mission!

J: You don't think they reached him then?

S: No, they probably got off course in time. 

D: Imagine, little knots of ---- -- ----------

R: He comes back with a question. 

D: Well, see, the ship was a "sane shape," yes? Tell me, what other shape is sane? 

J: I don't think he could tell you. 

S: Talos knows. He designed the ship after it.

D: Do you understand? I understand that you won't. You walk on sleeping giants. 

J: And the ship, well...

S: It was made out of tiny bits of giants. Each bit of metal fit in with the other, and traced the lines, to mimic the center of this realm. 

D: So when one song box sings a lullaby that keeps the other asleeps... pardon, mixing metaphors. Let us say that you have a room full of song boxes, that sing only when they are snoring. Each one sings a lullaby, and each one is put to sleep by only one other lullaby. 

R: Now with Tamriel you have redundancies.

J: Not as many as you might expect, but you have quite a few.

D: They are there.

S: In such a small ship though, not so much. So it started to ---- --

D: --- ----------

J: No clue what thought might melt their egos.

D: Regardless, the ship is gone. 

R: We can't find any trace of the Argonian either. 

J: Yeah, and we could... you don't want to know. Nevermind.

S: If we could offer advice.

J: Don't try to go there again. 

R: Yeah, there are better places to go. 

D: If I might make a suggestion though, don't bother trying. The moons are as far as you need to go. Still bound to the rest of it, even if it's harder. 

S: Couldn't even walk on the dragon, if you got there. He's not solid, ----- ---
