**By Pact Templar Crantus Talanius the Dawnscaled, 2E 582**

In these dark days, the Demon Lords of Oblivion who neglected our world in ages past have grown even more vigilant in their effort to corrupt and break it apart for their own amusement. These profane spirits are, though their spheres being prevalent in all things, not one with Mundus, and thus their actions serve only to wreak havoc on Tamriel, and steal mortal souls.

While you might relish in your great knowledge or prize your skill to hunt, take heart that you do not lose yourselves in these things; for useful as they may be, they are not Aedric. By walking the paths of the Daedra, you will turn yourself into a pawn of their will in the illusion of power and might, and cause great suffering for Nirn, and Arkay will grieve over another lost soul.

Keep in your heart always the Sixteen Warnings; that you may never be swayed onto the path of Evil:

* **Azura: Trust not the fickleness of Twilight, for though it wears a grey cloak, it shifts between the Day and the Night without warning, and it cannot be trusted.**


* **Boethiah: Praise not yourself higher than others, and destroy not others to further your own goals, for Arrogance leads only to Fall at the hands of those you betrayed.**


* **Clavicus Vile: Be wary of deals and pacts, and let not yourself be tempted by golden promises, for the price is ruin for yourself and others.**


* **Hermaeus Mora: Beware the thirst for knowledge and give never in to its lures, for no mortal will ever be All-Knowing, and to pursue the impossible is to walk the path of ruin.**


* **Hircine: Hunt out of need and not for the thrill alone, for that is to bring needless death and destruction, and to take Life without respect is to spit in the eyes of the gods.**


* **Malacath: Do not seek isolation, for no one can accomplish all they wish alone, and flawed as mortals are, we can only prosper through cooperation.**


* **Mehrunes Dagon: Let not your own ambitions bring ruin to others, and do not relish in the chaos left in your wake, for taking without giving, though it may help you now, will betray you later, and halt the accomplishments of others.**


* **Mephala: Do not ever turn your back on the truth or shroud yourself in lies and secrecy, for lies birth only more lies, and you will unwillingly turn yourself into an intrustable tool of evil, with nothing to live for other than harm upon your fellow mortal.**


* **Meridia: Do not let the trust you place in the colourful light that banishes the darkness blind you to all else, for although it is Aetherial and trustworthy amidst the dark of Oblivion, and your staunch ally in your war against Evil, be wary that you do not see darkness where none is found.**


* **Molag Bal: Enslave not the weak, and use not others as a tool for your schemes, for in doing so, you enslave yourself to the temptation of might as well, and cause your slaves to suffer.**


* **Namira: Do not seek the darkness and strive to bring yourself down, for in doing so, you bring everyone down.**


* **Nocturnal: Do not deal with, trust or attempt to know that which makes itself unknowable, and do not rely on luck, for both will give equally unpredictable results, and the good will not make the bad insignificant.**


* **Peryite: Never let the ends justify the means in your quest to solve a problem, for it will only spawn more problems to plague the world, yourself, and those around you.**


* **Sanguine: Never give in to carefreeness and lack of concern for your actions, for the consequences will ultimately only grow more grave.**


* **Sheogorath: Do not give in to your inner demons of despair and paranoia, or try to addle your mind, for to do so is to destroy your very being and create an abominable and chaotic monster, that will only serve to bring more chaos.**


* **Vaermina: Live in the Now and seek not the mystical veil of your dreams, for though it appears colourful and euphoric, you will only lose yourself within its nightmarish maze.**


Templar, citizen, lord or king; stay true to your duty and heed these warnings in your heart, or you will walk the Road to Ruin.
