This is just something that I chanced to begin thinking upon in my 'Eastern Eyes' research. As a result, I haven't been able to get it out of my head.

For those who are not aware of the lore being referenced here, perhaps a little Blackfyre history lesson is in order.

***

As of the most recent updates to the lore in TESO, In the long history of Skyrim, there have been two *known* Royal crowns which have served as the symbol of the High King.

The First is the *Jagged Crown*, which was said to have been forged from the teeth of ancient dragons and was the crown used by the High Kings of the First Empire of the Nords. It was lost when Borgas died during the Wild Hunt.

The Second Royal Crown was the *Crown of Verity*. This was actually a magical device crafted by a conclave of mages, which was enchanted to reject those it *"deemed unworthy"*. The criteria of worthiness are not, however, known to us. But it is written in *Crown of Freydis* that the crown chose the humble Kjoric the White over the more overt and martial Asurn Ice-Breaker. The Crown of Verity literally refused to be placed on Asurn's head and this, in turn, showed Asurn's true nature. He subsequently threatened to kill all present unless they elected him High King.

Now fast forward many, many centuries, to the end of the second century of the fourth era. Skyrim remains governed largely the same as it always was. The Jarls convene and choose a High King. The Pact of Chieftains ensures that if there is a direct heir, they are not opposed unless there is very valid reason. One difference is that the old capital of Winterhold was eschewed by the Third Empire, in favor of the Imperial Capital of Solitude, and it was from Solitude that the Imperial High Kings were mostly- though not always- chosen. Another is that Imperial Law is superimposed upon the Kingdom of Skyrim and both Imperial and Skyrim law coexist to some degree.

The Crown of Verity isn't mentioned in *Skyrim*. But since it was still present at the start of the interregnum, and since the Nords joined Tiber Septim voluntarily, it stands to reason, that the traditions of Skyrim's kings were preserved by the Septims. It is quite possible that the Crown of Verity remained in the hands of the High Kings.

In the years before 4E 200, a High King dies. A young man named Torygg is nominated, and as per Skyrim's custom, he is accepted as High King, since he is the son of the previous king, Istlod. If we accept that the Crown of Verity remains in Solitude, which is its traditional resting place, the boy was accepted by the crown.

At the moot, one Jarl however, does however, speak out. He speaks out against the influence of the Empire, against the current diplomatic situation with the Thalmor and about his belief in Skyrim as a nation. It isn't known if this Jarl nominates himself as High King. It is, however, entirely possible, if not probable. 
He also earns the sincere respect of young Torygg for his love of country and his bravery. This Jarl of course, is Ulfric Stormcloak.

But as we all know, Torygg chose the Empire over Ulfric. After a short reign, for reasons unknown, Ulfric Stormcloak allegedly challenges Torygg to a duel of honor and kills him.

Therefore, I put before you, TES Lore, my theory.

That is, that much of what we see of Jarl Ulfric is driven not only by the fact that he *wants* the throne of the High King, but that **Ulfric's actions are the result of him being refused by the Crown of Verity**.

Ulfric seeks the sword of High Queen Freydis as a way to link himself to her legacy without the Crown of Verity, which was renamed the **Crown of Freydis** in her honor.

He also utilizes an ancient, and no longer widely approved of method of gaining legitimate claim to the throne; that is, he kills the reigning king in single combat (whether the combat was fair is not something I am debating). It is an ancient precedent, but many have misgivings about it. The Empire of course, denounce the tactic.

He also seeks out an alternate crown, the Jagged Crown, as a weapon against Elisef of Solitude, who may well still have the Crown of Verity in her possession. Ulfric needs to gain the jagged crown as a way to earn favor over and above Elisef, who has the traditional Crown of Verity, which, if we accept this thinking, Ulfric cannot wear. It also ought be noted that the Imperials only seek the Jagged Crown as a means to stymie and deny Jarl Ulfric.

So scholars, tell me your thoughts. Was Jarl Ulfric possibly rejected by the Crown of Verity? Share your feedback. And your cheese.
