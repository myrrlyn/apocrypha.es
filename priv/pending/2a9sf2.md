In my [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2a7qr1/the_last_dragonborn_precendents_for_apotheosis/) I posed the possibility of the last dragonborn attaining apotheosis through one of the Walking Ways: soul stacking. If I have it down right, this consists of pouring a huge amount of creatia into a single being, which is ordinarily derived through the souls of mortals. The result is that the oversoul reaches a high subgradient in the Godhead's dream, becoming alike to a divine or cosmic being.

In this case, we see the Dragonborn perform soul stacking with dragons instead of, say, Dwemer (as was the case with the Numidium). It is possible that *whether* this works as a Walking Way depends on *how* it works in the first place.

I see three possibilities, though other suggestions are welcome. The first is that the absorbed souls barely if at all react with LDB's own soul. LDB has access to them, but is not comprised of or metaphysically altered by them.

The second is that his soul literally eats the other souls. For example, when he killed Mirmulnir, Mirmulnir's soul was destroyed and the Dragonborn's soul doubled in size.

The third more closely resembles Talos and ALMSIVI. Instead of being a whole bunch of separate souls as in #1 or one gigantic soul as in #2, an oversoul is formed. LDB is the head of this oversoul, and every dragon soul in it is a part of him/her, but the individual souls also retain a degree of individuality.

In the second and third scenarios, the sheer amount of creatia and AE would likely render our hero a cosmic or divine being sometime after the events of Skyrim. In the first scenario, I do not know how that would work out, since I am not aware of anything similar occurring in the lore.

It should be noted that all souls involved are shards of the Aka-tusk. This may affect our results. Maybe LDB becomes independent of Aka, or maybe he/she becomes a second Nordic aspect of Aka. Maybe a bit of both, or something in between, or an Ysmir-made-divine concept that includes LDB's possible connection to Shor. Maybe none of the above.

The point of this post is most of all to ask how soul absorption works. What happens to an absorbed dragon soul, and how it may interact with LDB's soul. Also, I'm curious as to any theory or conjecture as to what this all would turn our hero into.

In any case, I am considering doing a follow-up on how I personally believe soul absorption works, using as much evidence as I can assemble from the lore.
