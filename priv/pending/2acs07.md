Andoe brought the dead body of Faolan to his camp. There, the late king was put on a stone slab, in front of his tower. His kin and kith stood around the body.  
Andoe was the first to speak: "O great king Faolan, who now lays before me. You have fought for us and for our Old Gods, but you have failed as well. Your hatred for Orcí and Héstram, which were pure in the beginning, has consumed you. It has led you of your true path, and angered the gods. You will not be a martyr, or a saint, but you will be remembered, by every old woman and every young boy of the Reach. Let your past battles and strives be example to all of us. The Reach is lost, and you should fear no more."  
He chanted the following verse:  

O King deceased,  
Now laying here.  
Eternal sleep  
Frees you of fear.

Suibhne spoke: "Your hate has consumed you, Faolan, but now you may rest. Let it go before you join your fathers and their fathers. They will smile on you for it, and even the gods will accept you again. Part now, great king, and let your strength and prowess in battle be your memory."  
He chanted the following verse:

Memory of strength  
And of great offence.  
We shall sing at length  
Of your great defence.  

Morrígu moved from among the ranks, and spoke: "Fallen Eagle, Great Hunter, Late King. My sisters and I gave you the gift of strength and magicka and hard-flesh, but you twisted. You let yourself be corrupted, and corrupted the gift we bestowed upon you. Let your death and your fall from grace be an example for the others in your ranks, for all your brothers and sisters and children. Our gift is for the Reach as a whole, and not just for men."  
She chanted the following verse:

King Faolan, woe is me,  
For I made you Bráircór.  
Now let death make you free,  
And be tainted no more.

After these verses, the death-games began. The warriors and heroes and champions of Faolan performed their sword-feats and shield-feats and armour-feats. In memory of their king they fought like him, with the fierceness of bears, and the swiftness of Eagles. Many were bloodied and injured, but all remained standing by the memory of their late king.  
After the games, a great pyre was build in honour of Red Eagle. When lit, the flames reached upwards, high enough to lick Cneréc's heels and catch her tears.  
The flames began to whirl, and shot downwards like a Dragon's Voice. The flames circled on the ground, and from them came forth the astral and ethereal shade of Faolan.  
He appeared young and beautiful, not glad in a loincloth or Stag's Head, but in his old armour, in the custom of his people. He was helmetless, and on his hip was his longsword, radiating white light. His beard was thrice braided, and his fair hair was nine-times braided. In the braids, a innumerable amount of beads and gems were woven, each holding divine strength.  
The ghost spoke: "Thank you, kin and kith. I have parted now, just as my wish for your lands has parted. Both were my own doing. Do not cry for me, or for my death, but cry for the Reach. Be proud of who you are, so that you might one day join me and your ancestors. Promise me that you will never forget the Reach, and the proud men that fell in her defence [of which I am not part]. The Reach is never conquered other than in name."  
All promised him this, before raising their arms and chalices to the Ghost.  
Faolan spoke again: "When the fire clears, all that is left is the burial of my body, as is custom. Bury me in my old armour, helmed and armed, and put me on my old throne. This area will not know a King in a long time, for this is the knowledge Julach and Kai gave me. Prepare my body in the ways and magics of our ancestors. In death, I will not be able to defend the Reach, but I will protect the last ember of our freedom, so that it might be lid in the future by those that know our ways."  
He chanted the following verse:  

Do not weep, do not lament  
Of how I came to be dead.  
The Rape I could not prevent  
For now my fate I have met

Faolan's ghost departed then. His body was balmed and prepared as fits a king, and blessed and enchanted as fits a warrior. The greatest of his kin and kith carried his body into his tower, led by Andoe, who aided his king at every command. They put Faolan's body on his thrown, his hand on his sword, which was also named as such. He was to be the guardian of his tower, and was to defeat any challenger to his throne.  
They sealed the door, and left the dead king then.

This is how Faolan was buried, and how the Reach fell to Héstram. This was the end of the Rape of the Reach.
