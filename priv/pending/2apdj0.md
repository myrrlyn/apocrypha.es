A worn traveler had made his way into Daggerfall, and stopped into a building which looked far more worn than him. The rotting, wooden sign out front read â€œOgrim's Pint." the man sighed, he wanted to find an inn with seemingly less drunks, but he couldn't be bothered. As he opened the creeky door, he heard a young Breton bard singing the lively and upbeat song of the Daggermen:




*When a ghost haunted the town*

*It disturbed the royal crown*

*And so an agent was thus sent*

*To set Daggerfall's ghost to rest*

*And so he went he went from here to there* 

*He swung his silver in the air*

*But th'agent did not beware*

*That more than ghosts did linger there*

*And so the kings were squabbling* 

*Over this giant golden thing*

*And the agent was reckoning*

*Which came forth in time breaking*

*It warped and bent and merged again*

*So many kingdoms gone and then*

*A mighty few did reign supreme*

*But lost was this death machine*


*The agent returned to his grace*

*And saw the content of his face*

*And so we all should give our thanks*

*To the agent, ghosts, and ancient things*
