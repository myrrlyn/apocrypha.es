*After MK told us that Huna in* *[The Song of Pelinal](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Song_of_Pelinal)* *was a man and also intended to be Pelinal's lover, I found myself really interested by the parallels between them and Achilles and Patroklos. Additionally, since the biweekly theme is projectiles and Huna "took death from an arrowhead", I wrote this as a quick contribution to the theme.*

***

I lay on Cyrod's earth with my heartbeat like a drum in my ears and an arrow in my chest, and I thought, irrationally, *Pelinal will come*. I knew it wasn't true. You were not there and there was nothing you do could for me. You send men to death; you do not bring them back. As the soil beneath me turned to red mud, I hallucinated your face. I saw you as I first saw you, Pelinal, blood-mouthed and glorious, burning in rage. I loved you then.

While the sky turned wine-dark overhead, the pain became cold white static and numbed me to my fingertips. The battle-noise around me faded, and I thought of you again; I dreamed you in the stars. Their light was the last thing I could see. Pelin-El, all I can do now is wait for you.
