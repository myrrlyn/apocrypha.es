It was a late and cool evening on the the streets of New Hlaalu. Kvorsek sat with rounded legs before the erected statue of Saint Vivec, which was constructed ten years prior in 4E 212. 

He looked up at the figure of the once-god and released a short sigh. "my lord," he said, "you know me as your one true follower, and the self of yourself. Many years have I followed your steps and walked your walk. Follow my love as I have yours." 

With that, he stood and walked away. He made his way to the fields a mile out of the city, and there he sat under the Acre tree to meditate. So deep in thought and self he became that he did not move nor open his eyes four fourteen months and fourteen days.

In his sleep, he saw the fallen moon before its fall, the heart of the mountain and reign of the three. He saw the writings of the sermons, the rise of the nerevarine, and all the days of then and now. 

As his eyes opened, so did his body rise in accord. His eyes glowed golden and the walk was completed. He uttered a single sentence,  "I am he who are we all."
