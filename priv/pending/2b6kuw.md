Cultural Diversity in Hammerfell: The Roseguardians


by Jaganvir Ibn Rihadh, Court Scribe of Rihad


The Roseguardians are one of the "Thousand Tribes" of indigenous men of Hammerfell. Although largely unknown, their Creation Myth tells of a land called haLtvir far to the east, where their people lived. It tells of the Kingdom of haSenem, which ruled peacefully. However, when the evil haLra founded their kingdom and conquered haLtvir with the aid of the Drakons, they were forced to flee. Theories suggest that haSenem is the Tsaesci and haLra is the Po'tun, but this remains to be seen.


Roseguardian culture is vastly similar to Daggerfallrim Breton, with a strict feudal system. They are divided into the 5 Lordships Paramount of Lilac Vale, Lotus Marsh, Rose Crown, Petunia Rock, and Poppy Plain. These are each named after their Gods, The Lilac, Tava, the Poppy, HoonDing, the Lotus, Morwha, the Rose, Ruptga, the Petunia, Dibella, the Alkanet, Zeht, and the Hyacinth, Tu'whacca. Roseguardian religion venerates these gods in large temples called Ministries of the Blooming. Their Gods are believed to be the flowers of the One, an obscure entity. Nirn, the Fruit, produces life, the Seed for new Gardens.
