&gt;#Notes on Echmer Subraces

The species of Tamriel are divided into many subgroups. The Argonians have the Naga, Sarpa, and more. The Reachmen are an offshoot of Bretons. And the Khajiit have over 24 different physical forms depending on the phases of the moon. Similar to those races, the Echmer are compromised of subspecies as well, four to be exact. These different groups have the general Echmeri body makeup, but have substantial anatomical differences that set them apart from each other.

The main reason these groups exist is because of the tonal architecture used by the Dwemer affected all the different types of bats, not just one particular species of them. As they took on more humanoid shapes and became more intelligent, these species would eventually mingle (resulting in the modern Echmeri form) but largely remain unaltered from each other: the subgroups are the *Hemaechi*, the *Entoechi*, the *Pomiechi*, and the *Lactechi*.

The **Hemaechi**, which means ‘the blood echoes’ (or in Tamriel, ‘the blood bats’) are generally the largest of the Echmer race in terms of both size and muscle. They are descended from ancient vampire bats, and because of this their main source of nourishment is blood. They drink it, creating interesting wines out of the substance, or create morsels of blood in the form of gelatin. Hemaechi can drink the blood of most creatures (they refrain from drinking the blood of Daedra or their own), mainly the Yak, which is the prized herd animal of the Echmeri race.

The **Entoechi**, which means ‘the insect echoes’ (or in Tamriel, ‘the insect bats’) are generally the most athletic and perceptive of the Echmer race. Their eyes are more adjusted to natural light than others of their kind. They are descended from ancient insect-eating bats, resulting in their present diet consisting of the creatures that make up the insectoid family (because of this, they were also somewhat responsible for the Hyu-Ket dying off due to their insect-like physicality). Their favorite delicacy are large mites that live in the Dweech.

The **Pomiechi**, which means ‘the fruit echoes’ (or in Tamriel, ‘the fruit bats’) are generally the most limber and flexible of the Echmer race. They are descended from ancient fruit bats, and naturally their main source of food is fruit. They are known for adding fruit into multiple dishes and beverages, as well as making absurdly sweet types of wine that are actually made from fruit other than grapes, or at least contain very little of their flavor (for they think that ‘ordinary’ wine is boring in terms of taste).

The **Lactechi**, which means ‘the milk echoes’ (or in Tamriel, ‘the milk bats’) are generally the most hardy and enduring of the Echmer race. They are descended from ancient milk-drinking bats, and continue the practice in the present by consuming dairy products as their main forms of substance. They eat yogurt, cheese, and mainly cream, making interesting flavors for each of them. According to their own records, they have created over a hundred different types of milk alone.
