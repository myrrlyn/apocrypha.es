These works were found at a burning caravan wreckage approximately three days ride south of Bravil. The body holding them was burnt beyond recognition but can only be assumed to be one Alomir Firefist, the author of the works. He is presumed to be the son of Krogmir Firefist, a bard of much renown in the frozen lands of Skyrim.


**Alomir Firefist 4E 201.**

*I have traveled through the sands of Hammerfell to Skaven to meet our orc wizard, Lo-Gash. He claims to hail from Orsinium but this information has not been verified though I see no reason to mistrust him. Upon arriving in Skaven I met with our friend Lo-Gash at the local tavern for a drink, a luxury both Nord and Orc enjoy. After our revelry we set off to our seperate chambers to rest for tomorrows display of magical skill and finesse.*

*At first light Lo-Gash and myself set off to a clearing outside of Skaven to begin the display of magical might. It was early and before the brutal sun of the Alik'r began to beat down on the denizens of Hammerfell when we began. Lo-Gash flung both fire and ice with destructive force, cascading spells upon the rocks of the desert shattering them, spewing molten rock and shattering boulders. The orc seemed well versed in the art of destruction and delighted in the mayhem he spread across the sands.* 

*When I asked him if he could show some orcish techniques in the school of Alteration or Illusion, the light of joy in his eye vanished. He displayed some knowledge of the schools but not nearly to the extent of his skill and passion towards the school of Destruction. When asked later about this he said "my fellow orcs do not view such cowardly behavior as acceptingly as the schools of war."*

*It seems as though in the life of a warring orc, born and raised in the harsh strongholds there is less room for the elegant side of the magickal arts. Though few in number the wizards and mages amongst the orcs can be fearsome foes in battle, but expect more hurt than healing when confronting these incredible foes on the open field.*

*At dawn tomorrow we set out for High Rock, the home of the Bretons, a people with deep roots in the arcane arts. In Volume 2 I hope to get a deeper insight towards how the Bretons not only view magic, but how they use it.*
