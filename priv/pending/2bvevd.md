*Foreword: When Cloud Ruler Temple was sacked in 4E 174, the majority of the Blades Archives were consumed by Aldmeri flames. Luckily, the most important tomes had been removed from the library to an unknown location for reasons unknown to this scholar. Below is a copy of a journal that was delivered anonymously to me by courier as part of a collection, sealed with a wax seal known to have been used by Reman's Dragonguard. I have transcribed what I can from the draconic tongue it was written in and edited it to read better in Common Tamrielic. The results are most intriguing.*

How long has it been since these visions have been affecting our people? I cannot remember. The Council have asked Vulonfaasah for wisdom but the Great Dragon has reassured us that if we continue to venerate the Dovah we will stay safe, and in time will embrace these visions as a blessing.

The populous of the city are growing weaker, the little ones are dying in their sleep and yet the Dragons do nothing to help us. Why, what have we done?

Whether the Dragons are behind these visions is blasphemy, surely?

*I have studied this journal extensively since it was given to me and I have reached the following conclusions. I would date it as being penned before the Dragon War (for the author asks for advice from a dragon, of which we have no records of one by that name) and the author seems to be high up in the echelons of the Dragon Cult, for we know the common man was forbidden to utter or transcribe the word 'dragon'.*

*The city (which one, I do not know) appears to have been cursed by visions, or nightmares, to which the author seems to be skeptical of the dragons reassurance of protection. The author notes that the 'liitle ones' are dying, but whether this is due to this plague of nightmares I highly doubt. Perhaps a more likely explanation would be there had been poor harvest and they were dying of malnutrition.*

*Another interesting point is the author thinks that the dragons are behind the visions. Maybe there had been dissent among the population, and this was the dragon's way of reminding them who was in charge.*
 
*The final point I would bring to your attention is the name of the dragon, Vulonfaasah. Cross-referencing with Hela Thrice-Versed's revised edition of Dragon Language: Myth no More, a rough translation would be Night-Fear-Hunter. Could this dragon have been the Weaver of Panoply herself? I have searched the Imperial Library for any records of a Daedric Prince personifying as a dragon, to which I found only one source: a [manuscript](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1ykcvs/the_daedric_dovah/) dismissed by the Imperial Library as being 'ramblings of a madman'. The names of the dragons do not correlate, but the idea of Vaermina masquerading as a dragon does.*

*This journal will require further study.*
