Berahzic,

Crawling on your breast brings sweet music from your lips, dearest sister, but not sweet enough to swallow the bitterness of your earlier compositions, those you crowed while you preened atop your gilded perch.  When you flew, you fancied yourself alone as worthy of love, and now that the bill has arrived you find yourself clutching at your empty pockets.  Still, though you fled from our volary, enclosed you will find a partitioning of feed.  We hope that it will serve to fill your beak, and that of the young devil plotting beneath your apron.  When your molting mate comes dry again, perhaps it will help stay his claw.  But do not fly back to us again; we consider this payment for your absence.

Yours in cacophonous cackling,

Lanali
