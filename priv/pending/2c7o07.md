For eons without end the land languished under the dominion of demons and their mortal puppets, and men lived as slaves, unable to rise out of squalor and oppression. But then Paravant rose like the morning star, a burning opalescent crystal in the sky, and her soft radiance cleared away all the shadows of the night. Hearths and hearts were filled with the fire of freedom and fight-drunkenness. She came bearing a firebrand in one hand and a pile of clay in the other. In times of war and darkness, she is a beacon-bearer and a rekindler of sleeping coals. In times of peace, she mends the forges of mens’ souls, and makes whole the cracks which cause their hearts to grow cold.

O, Holy Perrif, without you Kyne’s breath would have brought frozen death out of Atmora to all the sons and daughters of Shor. Icy winds bore down on the old chieftains but they merely wore the frost with pride. You taught them that men must submit to Love, that they cannot surrender to the cold, they are responsible for maintaining the Dragonfires. And when Akatosh bestowed upon you glowing sinews from his heart, you tamed mighty Morihaus. Leading him by the horn, you incensed him into a great rage, and his breath-shout-whisper caused the sinew of Akatosh to glow and shimmer and light the way for Pelinal to return.

We thank you, Al-Esh, for the blessings you have given us. Please forgive us for using them to kill our enemies. Pelinal is our hammer, and though the collateral damage he causes is immense, it’s hard to get a war properly forged without a reliable hammer. May Reman protect us from the worst of his madness, and give us something solid to fall back on when all else fails.
