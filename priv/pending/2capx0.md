The Memory Shard of Boaq Sosem

I am Boaq do Sosem No Shira Hel Ansei no Matsu, born among the Chrome Guards in the wastelands of Oblivion. I have taken the Oath of the Chrome Spirit and now the Changing is complete. The other Matsu informed me of your reluctance to take part in the Changing. I was afraid, at first, to comply with the edicts of the Make Way, but the laws are clear. The flesh is weak, but the spirit is strong! Thus we cast off our flesh and replace the meat with metal, so we will not be weak when we finally reach the Far Shores. 

For our fathers fought the Brass God, but his armor of ignorance was too great even for the forbidden arts. His cog-stomps sent the Redguard into the sea, where many denied existence and others drowned. Only a few saw the light of the Make Way, and he led them to the Far Shores. But Ruptga was displeased. He banished them again as he did in the beginning time, because they were too weak to withstand the Brass God. This time he sent us to wander the planes of Oblivion so that we might not become complacent as our ancestors did.

But we did not sacrifice the Land of The Ancestors for nothing!

The Hoon Ding taught us new words in new languages, and he showed us how to subjugate the demons. He taught us how to cut with more than swords, and how to use the blood of our enemies to make us strong.

So now you have been reminded, Yokeda, of our solemn duty as leaders of the Tribe. You have been reminded of the reason behind the Changing and its necessity for our survival.

We take the stones of memory, and lodge them in our skulls so we will never forget.

We take the Hearts of the Demons to make them our slaves.

We take the bones of our enemies, and graft them to ourselves so that we will be strong.

We drink the blood of the Daedra and eat their flesh.

We take the Hunger of Sep and make it our weapon.

Though we have slain over a thousand foes, and have trekked across countless realms, the light of the Hoon Ding shall guide us home! We will show that we did not walk the demon realms for nothing!
