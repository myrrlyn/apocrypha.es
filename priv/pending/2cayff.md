Guide to Greenheart, First Edition

by Karinar Arrin


By the strength of Saint Fargoth the Builder, Aran Rhulain welcomes you to Greenheart.

Greenheart is a large city of southern Valenwood and one of the eight traditional Aransels of Valenwood. Ruled by the Aran Rhulain Tarlain, it boasts a burgeoning population of 5,743.


***History***


Greenheart is one of the oldest cities of Valenwood, having been founded by Topal the Pilot in one of this many journeys. It served as Valenwood's capital during the reigns of Emperors Agnorith and Pelagius, but was soon displaced by its larger neighbor Woodhearth. In the Stasis Cultists' invasion of Valenwood, the city was razed. Centuries later, a young blacksmith named Fargoth sought to rebuild this ancient city. Using only his pickaxe and his devotion to Z'en, he rebuilt this Ancient city out of Stone. Now called the Stone City, Greenheart looks to a Bright Future.


***Districts***


Greenheart contains Several districts; the Temple District, the Market District, the Guild's District, the Lower District, and Stonehold. The Temple District is home to the Temple of Z'en, the largest building in the City. It also contains the Palace and the Barracks. The Market district contains most of the Services in the city. Tarhiel keeps a fine inn, the Greedy Witch, and Matanir's Arms forges any type of weapon you could need. The Guild district contains chapters of all the major guilds of Tamriel, and the Green Mirror sells hunting supplies. Just steer clear of the abandoned Fishing shop - Thieves are known to do business there. The Lower District, also called the Seaside district, contains houses and Swordfish Gully, a dock containing the Bragging Seagull, which serves the finest ale in the South of Valenwood. Stonehold, built into the Hillside, contains upper-class holes and the historic quarry where Saint Fargoth mined the stones that form Greenheart.
