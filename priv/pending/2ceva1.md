**Falasmaryon Excavation Notes**

**Entry #01**

It has been three days since our excavation team arrived at Falasmaryon. The excavators have found the stronghold in poorer condition than we had anticipated. The upper level has caved in from the center, leaving most of the structure filled with ash and rocky soil. The only exposed areas are a propylon chamber, a small anteroom, and another small room on the surface. These rooms are tilted on one side due to the cave-in. Half crew is already working on clearing the entryway; the other half is making measurements and assembling support structures. In the meantime, my partner Looks-In-Dust and I will investigate the exposed chambers on the morrow.

The propylon chamber was empty save the broken pillars. While most of a propylon pillar is plain stone, the base is carved on all sides with a winding knot pattern. For now I made a rubbing of this pattern (which is fastened to this entry) but I will also send a few men to cut away a piece of the stone. From what I understand, these propylon pillars had magical properties which allowed transport between certain Dunmer strongholds. How this teleportation mechanism worked is a mystery to us, so it would be wise to bring a sample back to the Arcane University.
The contents of the other chamber had all fallen to one side of the room during the cave-in. I worked with Looks-In-Dust to sift through the plant and cloth fibers (likely from baskets and other containers) that had gathered in the corner. We found the remnants of a skeleton. Judging by the abnormal growths and contortions on the jawbone, femur, and clavicle, the subject had suffered from corprus disease. Other than a small amulet with a fragment of ruby remaining, there was nothing more of interest. Looks-In-Dust identified the amulet as a Sixth House amulet. This confirms our prediction that Falasmaryon’s latest inhabitants were Sixth House cultists. The amulet is devoid of magical properties since the fall of Dagoth Ur, but it’s going back to the University anyway.
There is no more for us to investigate until the lower level is cleared out. I suppose I will help with the digging.

**Entry #03**

We discovered a large gap in the western side of the stronghold today. Falasmaryon is built on a slight hill, and the western side slopes downward, exposing a bit more of the lower level. One of the excavators actually stepped in a patch of loose dirt which fell away to reveal a tiny opening in the wall. With all of the loose dirt away, the opening is large enough for a man to fit inside. It leads to a tunnel that I can only assume is a sewer system. I looked around but did not venture inside. Compared to the rest of the stronghold, this sewer is very well preserved. There are men installing support structures now. I will investigate the sewer tomorrow when the passages are safer.

Today I explored the sewers beneath Falasmaryon. I would have brought Looks-In-Dust with me, but he was strangely reluctant to set foot in the sewer. The tunnels remarkably intricate and well preserved. I decided to tie a rope to a fixture outside and carry the end throughout the passages to avoid getting lost. I discovered a short staircase which led to a chamber on the lower level, seemingly unaffected by the cave-in. In the middle of the room there was a crude stack of chairs and tables tall enough to touch the cieling. Coins were meticulously arranged on the floor into a sigil design which I did not recognize. I made a sketch of the sigil in case Looks-In-Dust will recognize it. Toward the opposite corner of the room, I found a triangular Sixth House shrine, built in tiers which were adorned with small figurines of painted red clay. I would have taken one to study, but honestly, something told me just to leave them be. It may sound foolish, but something about the primitive, archaic, and vaguely humanoid appearance is frightening. I digress. There was a carving in the floor near the shrine which appears to be a combination of Daedric and Dwemer script, including another script that I have never seen before. A closer inspection revealed the entire floor to be sparsely covered in symbols of this unknown script. There were more skeletal remains beside the carving. These did not appear to be affected by corprus disease. Judging by the shape of the skull, the subject was a female mer. I made several rubbings to bring to Looks-In-Dust as my knowledge of Dwemer and Daedric is not trustworthy. When I have his input, I will follow up on this entry.

Looks-In-Dust did not recognize the sigil or the mysterious script. He did, however, translate the rest of the engravings for me. Neither of us know what to make of it. We both fail to relate the message to any specific historical event, though the mentioned "red gem" is reminiscent of the Amulet of Kings and its destruction. Color motifs also suggest a relevance to Red Tower.  This is not unusual, given Falasmaryon’s location as well as its use as a Sixth House base. One theory is that this descibes the fall of Dagoth Ur. However, this creates many unanswered questions. I think the Arcane University can help us there. There is no point in agonizing over it right now. Looks-In-Dust seems to be thinking extensively on the matter though; I see him studying the rubbings often. When I approach the subject, he appears skeptical, almost disoriented, about something. I suppose it is natural. The translation is as follows:

*The rock falls, and the fire rises from where the Herald shattered the gem.*

*The rock falls when EEEE^(1) spell the Poet’s final words.*

*A circle of hands is unlinked from a missing Warden.*

*A circle of wires is broken from a missing Magus.*

*The rock falls, and the fire rises on the fifth Dawn.*

*The rash blame the Lover who dropped the rock.*

*The misguided blame the Herald who broke the red gem.*

*The unfaithful blame the Moon who melted the gold away.*

*The reluctant blame the Star who guided the Herald to the 
hammer and nail.*

*The vengeful blame the four Thieves who could not steal the gem.*

*The doomed blame the one Thief who sold it.*

*The skeptical blame the Pilgrim guided by the gem’s luster^(2).*

*The pessimists blame the Snake who tore the gem from inside itself and named it Discord.*

*All others blame the People, each with a shard of the gem embedded in their eyes.*

*The wise forgive all, for our sins are absolved in smoke and ash.*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


*(1)*This was four ekem in a row. Looks-In-Dust said that he had no explanation for it.

*(2)*From the rubbing, it was uncertain whether this read “luster” or “lust.”
