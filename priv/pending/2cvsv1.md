It was the last night of King Olaf's burning in Solitude and merriment filled the air. As was customary, all the little Nord boys and girls went around collecting money for the burning that was to take place later that evening. 

One such boy, through bad luck and misdirection, wound up in one of the darker parts of Solitude. He found before him a door that appeared to be unopened for some time now. After a few seconds' hesitation, he knocked on it.

A man opened the door - but what a man he was! Clad in strange blue robes and holding a strange staff, he was the most outlandish man the boy had ever seen. His beard and his wrinkles spoke of someone very, very old, but why had the elders never mentioned him if he was such? 

"Septims for King Olaf?" the boy said, equal parts eagerness and fear in his eyes.

"Ah, the Burning? Why, we haven't had one of those in a long time." The man looked down on the little boy with a sneer.

The boy cocked his head. "Will you or won't you?"

The man smiled. "Do you know who you're talking to? If you did, you wouldn't take that tone with me..."

The boy stopped in thought for a while.

"You're...a wizard, right?" 

The man smiled. "Very good."

"Then how comes you don't go outside like all the others?"

The wizard crouched down, down, until his eyes met the boy's. "Do you know the story of the First Wizard?"

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The very first wizard worked for the very first king, who was far stronger than any King or Emperor alive today. Under their joint rule, the kingdom became known everywhere as the best and greatest kingdom to ever exist. 

And the king's people lived good lives. And the kingdom prospered and grew, and all was well.

One day, the king told the wizard that he wanted to build a city that was greater than any city before it. He wanted to show the world how wondrous his kingdom was. And being his friend, he entrusted the details of its creation and construction to the wizard. 

The wizard was starstruck. He vowed on his name that he would design the best and greatest city the world had ever known, and a wizard never breaks his vows. Quickly, he set off to work on what he called The Silver City.

Workers came from far and near, all eager to labor for this creation the king and the wizard had devised. They wanted a share in this "Silver City" of many wonders.

Many days and many nights they worked, and every one of them was tired at the end of it. They all worked their hardest, because in each of their hearts was the secret desire that they would be chosen to lead this marvelous city.

At last, the sun dawned on the day of the city's completion! Despite the raggedness of their muscles, the workers all pulled themselves to the city's grand opening. The wizard was not there with the king to present it, but was hidden in the crowd, eager to hear their reactions to what he had created.

The king's voice was raised in elation as he started to declare who he had chosen to govern this fair city. "The lord of this fair city," he said, "shall be none other than myself. I shall rule over the city and this capital, and shall bear all the joys and sorrows inherent within both my stations." The wizard was overjoyed. He couldn't wait to hear the praises they would heap upon the king!

What the wizard did hear instead mortified him.

"Why should we content ourselves with this misery," they said, "when he has the kingdom entire? Why should we let him have this Silver City? The king has not known a day of labor, but we have worn ourselves ragged to the bone for this!" 

A yell and before the wizard could blink, the laborers were all rushing towards the king.

The king flopped helplessly against the current of angry arms and voices raised against him. The workers were furious. One rushed towards the king and, digging his fingers into his chest, tore out his heart. 

The first wizard's face grew dark. Taking his staff and his robe and his books and all his other wonders with him, he stormed off to the highest corner of the city. There he swore another vow on his name, his second and last one. Never again would he share his visions with the vulgar crowd. He would go on to design wonders that would outshine even the Silver City, but all aside from him would never lay their eyes on them, for their small minds and shriveled hearts were unworthy of his works. And in that moment he set the example for all wizards who would follow him.

---------------------------------------------------------------

"So the First Wizard swore to never know company ever again?"

"That's right."

"But doesn't that make him lonely? All that power and no-one to share it with?"

A long silence followed.

The wizard's expression was unreadable. "Go away, child."

"But-"

"I said GO AWAY." The wizard beat his staff on the ground. A small shock pulsed through the air, resounding through the empty streets and knocking the child on his feet. 

The child glimpsed one last time at the wizard. His face was darkened with anger. Momentarily, the child wondered; was that the same face the First Wizard wore when he made his second oath? And was that confusion he saw in his eyes too? His head spinning, the boy picked himself up and ran away.

Later that night, the wizard found that he could not sleep.
