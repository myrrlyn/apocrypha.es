*Editor's note: The following piece of lore is from a larger collection called Tales of Old Tamriel. Its exact origin is unknown, but some claim the library shelf containing the collection first appeared in the Imperial Library during the Middle Dawn, and has some connection to the blue star Mnemoli. Interestingly, many of these texts refer to events from the Second, Third and Fourth eras! When asked about this, the Moth Priests simply shrugged and informed me that compared to the mysteries of the Elder Scrolls and the Ysmir Collective, a magical bookshelf that contains historically misplaced lore is one of the less unusual things in the Library. When pressed for more information, I was politely informed that the Priests were too busy to address my concerns. Thus, I transcribed the stories and left with many unanswered questions. Perhaps future scholars can discover the true origin of these stories, which largely center around the lesser-known periods and rulers of history.*

*Scribe's Note: Shortly after the collapse of the Akaviri Potentate period of the Second Empire, the King of Orsinium sent out several missives asking representatives of the various beast races of Tamriel to join his Betmeri Pact in Wrothgar, in the hopes of defending Orsinium and its lands from possible aggression involving the Bretons and Redguards who had historically banded together to harry and oppress the Orcs, Goblins and Ogres. One such letter was sent to a great Minotaur chieftain of the Colovian Highlands. The following appears to be his reply. Why this scrap of parchment was kept by the Orcish king is unknown.*


To His Outcast Majesty, King Budgul Gro-Wrothgar,

I have received your letter of invitation, and have deliberated with other chieftains of my people. You seem to be an honest and upright man and your goal of sovereignty, self-reliance and independence is a noble one that my people understand well, for we embody those qualities ourselves. We have admired - from afar - the spirit and industrious nature of the Orsimer people. You are fine warriors and peerless smiths, and as a warrior of no small renown myself I concede the legendary deeds of Orc swordsmen and berserkers. Many of my brethren feel the same as I in this regard, so let it never be said that my people have no regard for Orcish steel or Orcish battle spirit.


 Our objection to and ultimate rejection of the invitation to join the Betmeri Pact stems from deep and profound spiritual differences between our races. The Men of Tor come from a proud old tradition. We worship Kyne as our matron goddess and our progenitor, and we're afraid this piety before the Mother of Storms would cause tension among you and your allies. We are aware of the Code of Malacath. We realize how deeply and fundamentally important this Daedric Prince is in the lives of not only Orcs, but your Goblin and Ogre allies. We could never abandon Kyne in favor of a Daedra. That would be unspeakable to us. Kyne mothered mighty Morihaus, who fathered us all. We are the true men of Colovia and carry the blood of the Dragon. We channel Kyne's breath through our mighty horns, which gore our enemies. 


When the Alessians harried the Colovian kingdoms and tried to force our fair-skinned cousins of Kvatch and old Stuhngrad to join their Empire, we Men of Tor resisted along with them. When the general Falchou was slain in Glenumbra and the remainder of his forces made the mistake of trying to escape through Chorrol, my ancestors were there. They gored through the retreating ranks and made them pay dearly for their intrusion. Many of the pursuing Bretons stood in awe of us, and abandoned their heathen worship of Z'en and Xarxes in favor of mother Kyne. When our lord Reman called out for mighty teamsters to stand at his side and help him unite the land, yea, we answered the call. Even his pet snakes recognized our honor and battle prowess, and dared not harass or subjugate us. 


Now, the land is descending into chaos. Reachmen run wild in the hills, screaming and murdering, and the Tharns have replaced the Akaviri as overlords of Nibenay, but in a way they are even more serpentine and cold-blooded than the snake men. Those, at least, were honest about their nature. With the Battlemages, the order of the day is duplicity, faithlessness and forgetfulness of past alliances.  And so the mighty men of the Sanctus Taurus find ourselves outcast and hated in our own lands - demonized as brutes and savages in popular fiction and folk belief. Perhaps it is because of this that you believe we'd join your pact, out of desperation and self-preservation. I admire the tenacity it took to ask us, but our answer to you shall remain negative for the foreseeable future. Being branded friends of Daedric cultists would do us no favors, I am afraid. There are still a few secluded groves where the mightiest sons of Belharza still dwell. These holy places are guarded by spriggans and unicorns. I am writing you from one such kingdom. As long as Kyne's wards remain, these places are safe. I appreciate your concern - truly - and hope for the safety of your own people. Pray to whatever outcast gods you wish, but know that Kyne was the first to cry for mortals. 

Your neutral contact,
Mujitaba the Iron-Hoofed
