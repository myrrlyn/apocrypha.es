Chapter Two -The Prayer of the Awakened


-------------------------------

The Mistress has much to teach us. All we need do is close our eyes and submit to the quagmire.

Repeat these words for Loyalty.
Repeat these words for Understanding.

For it is through them, and their understanding that you will truly be awakened.

&gt;As I lay my head to sleep
&gt;I pray to the mistress
&gt;my memories to keep
&gt;
&gt;The terror she sows
&gt;is the freedom I need.
&gt;It is only lesser minds
&gt;that beg and plead.
&gt;
&gt;Take her hand, 
&gt;covered in mud
&gt;Release your fear;
&gt;drown in blood.
&gt;
&gt;Now I lay my head to sleep.
&gt;I give unto the mistress,
&gt;my memories to keep
