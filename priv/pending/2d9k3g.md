**20thth Morning Star**

Lideg,

Your letter reached me. I rewarded the messenger well as always. I’m happy you’re alright, and am also very excited for our wedding. The guests might get a bit rowdy though, so take care. I trust you have found a silversmith to give you the ring. Wishing my mother-in-law good luck with moving out in the near future.

Love,

Amaya

Object 1: Location 2, class apparel/metal, state dilapidated/8 pieces, net lng. 3.67 ft., net wt. 18.01 lb., text false, portable true

Object 2: Location 2, class misc/gemstone, state fair/5 pieces (unbroken), net lng. 0.59 in. each, net wt. 14g. total, text false, portable true

Object 4: Location 2, class tool/metal, state fair/1 piece, net lng. 5.2in., net wt. 51g., text true, portable true

 Notes: Object 2.0.2.1 appears to be a piece of glass armor. Object 2.0.2.2 was a set of three amethysts, one emerald, and one ruby. These were contained in object 2.0.2.3, the remains of a small chest. Object 2.0.2.4 was a key with the same inscription as object 2.0.2.3. The chamber count for this canton is an estimate. We did not search the presumed lowest level because the Dreughs within posed too great of a threat. Therefore, we concluded the excavation of location 2.0 without searching chamber 2.0.5.
