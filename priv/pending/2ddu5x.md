**27th Morning Star**

Amaya,

You were right about the guests! What reason do they have to be so rough with us? Do you know? No matter; I am quite alright. And you have the ring, don’t you? The final preparations are all in order. We’re still on our way to the chapel, just looking for the wedding gifts. After all these years…

Always,

Lideg
