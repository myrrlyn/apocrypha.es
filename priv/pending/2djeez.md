*[Author’s Note: Before I left the Imperial Geographical Society, now nothing more than Tharn’s puppets, I was writing a catalogue of the beings known as the Daedric Princes. I have decided to finish this so it can function somewhat as an informative resource for amateur scholars and adventurers alike so they can know the inhabitants of Oblivion better.]*

The Daedra Lords (also known as the Daedric Princes, the Lords of Tumult, or the Princes of Misrule) are the et’ada beings that exist in the infinite realm known as Oblivion. They are the most powerful of the immortal beings that reside there, and range seventeen in number. The names of these beings are Azura, Boethiah, Clavicus Vile, Hermaeus Mora, Hircine, Jyggalag, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Mephala, Meridia, Molag Bal, Namira, Nocturnal, Peryite, Sanguine, Sheogorath, and Vaermina.

Together, these beings are the forefront of the beings known as Daedra (‘Daedroth’ is the singular form), and are thought of being the political system of Oblivion. Since times immemorial, they have been worshipped openly and secretly on Tamriel and commonly viewed as gods. Their powers are great, and in this book we shall explore them further.
###The Origin Of The Daedric Princes
The Daedra (which translates into ‘not our ancestors’ in Merish) are commonly believed to be just the et’ada that refused to help create Mundus. This in fact false, as many of them (Malacath, Meridia, and perhaps Mehrunes Dagon and Molag Bal) used to be other godly beings that were changed, while others (Hermaeus Mora and some say Peryite and Hircine) were created from pieces of creatia on accident or purpose. And Sheogorath is thought to be something else entirely. Amongst more experienced scholars, Daedra are simply the et’ada that choose to exist in Oblivion rather than Aetherius.

We first learned of the names of some of the Daedra Lords by Hale the Pious, but there have been constant mention of them in texts from the First Era and before. The Alessians labeled them as ‘daimons’, creatures that were not meant to be consorted with. However, their worship persisted regardless.

Each of the provinces have ancient Daedric venerations, but the ones with the most legends are Skyrim, High Rock, Summerset, Morrowind, and Cyrodiil. The most invaluable text about the Daedric Princes themselves is Maleficus Aeternus, an ancient saga from High Rock. Combining the mannish and merish ways of thinking, it seems to describe a war that takes place within Oblivion that caused the formation of the ruling party of Oblivion. Maleficus Aeternus is still being translated by many scholars, as it is considered a boon to the understanding of the Daedra Lords.

The Daedra Lords considered ‘born’ true Daedra are Azura, Boethiah, Clavicus Vile, Jyggalag, Namira, Nocturnal, Sanguine, and Vaermina. Out of these eight, Nocturnal is considered the ‘Ur-Dra’, or the First Daedra. Her influence causes all of the other Lords to respect her, although this does brings up the question if she is the most powerful of them all, which is debatable.

Malacath, Meridia, Mehrunes Dagon, and Molag Bal are considered the Daedra that were once other et’ada before becoming what they are today. Malacath, as is widely known, was once the god-hero known as Trinimac before he was corrupted (either eaten or defeated) by Boethiah, becoming what he is today. Ancient Ayleid texts (notably the Tract of Merid-Nunda) paint Meridia as ‘wayward solar daughter’, or a Magne Ge that was banished from Aetherius. Some Breton-Nordic myths paint Mehrunes Dagon as some sort of Aedric spirit who was cursed by either Alduin or Akatosh. And in Morrowind, Molag Bal is sometimes believed to have been a mysterious dreugh-like creature known as the Ruddy Man.

Hermaeus Mora, Hircine, and Peryite are considered the Daedra that were created by raw creatia that formed into something on its own or was fashioned as such. The worshippers of Hermaeus Mora often say that their master tells them that he was born from the unused schematics for the Mundus Magnus threw away. Legends about Hircine dictate he was the result of some ‘cosmic experiment’ that fused the thoughts of predators and prey together as one. And Peryite, through Nedic texts, is thought to have been forged from a ‘ghost-shape-concept’ floating in the void for a specific duty.

Sheogorath, in Aldmeri tradition, is referred to having been created when ‘Lorkhan’s divine spark was removed from this world’. Whether this states he was created at the moment Trinimac ripped out the Doom Drum’s heart is unclear, although a variation of this myth does call Sheogorath the ‘Sithis-shaped hole in the world’, lending some credence to the theory.
###Mortal Views On The Princes
Some Tamrielics view the Daedra Lords as evil beings, some as good beings, and others as both. In truth, these entities are beyond the mortal concepts of good and evil, and merely act upon what they are desiring to do at the moment. The correct word to describe them would be that they are ‘maleficent’, but can also be benevolent on occasion as well. 

The five Daedra Lords thought of being genuinely ‘evil’ are Boethiah, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, Vaermina, and Peryite. The spheres of these Princes are the most destructive and harming towards mortals, and thus they are considered sadistic to Tamrielics. Known together as ‘the Heralds of the End Times’, these five will supposedly herald the end times: Boethiah will start Conquest, Mehrunes Dagon will begin War, Molag Bal bestows Death, Vaermina shall bring Famine, and Peryite will infect what remains with Pestilence. It is thought that this labeling arose from ancient doctrines of the Alessian Empire, combined with some Altmeri records.

Genders amongst the Daedra Lords are even more debated for bizarre reasons. For once and for all, the Princes are genderless beings and may manifest as any gender. Some of them take on male only guises, while others take on female only guises. Others choose both, while some of them choose to not appear as anything even remotely mannish, merish, or beastfolk-like.
###Aedra and Daedra Relations
Only the most foolish of mortals think that the Aedra and Daedra are mortal enemies of one another: this is false. Although it is safe to say that some of the Daedra Lords are irritated by the worshippers of their Aedric brethren, they do not typically assault each other every day (or at least, to public knowledge they don’t). However, I have included in this book a list of the Daedra that oppose (or at the most, interfere with) the will of a specific Aedra:

Akatosh is opposed by worshippers of Hermaeus Mora, Peryite, Azura, and Vaermina.

Arkay is opposed by Molag Bal, Namira, Meridia, and Peryite.

Dibella is opposed by Namira, Sanguine, Mephala, Molag Bal, and Malacath.

Julianos is opposed by Hermaeus Mora, Azura, Mephala, Jyggalag, Boethiah, Clavicus Vile, and Sheogorath.

Kynareth is opposed by Hircine, Namira, Meridia, and Mehrunes Dagon.

Mara is opposed by Sanguine, Mephala, Molag Bal, and Malacath.

Stendarr is opposed by Boethiah, Mehrunes Dagon, Jyggalag, Sheogorath, and Vaermina.

Zenithar is opposed by Clavicus Vile, Peryite, and Jyggalag.
###Daedric Princes In Tamrielic Religions
Azura is worshipped primarily in Elsweyr and Morrowind, where she plays important roles in the creation of those two provinces most prominent denizens. She was the one that cursed the ancient Chimer into becoming the modern day Dunmer, and was responsible in creating the Khajiit from Aldmeri. The Dunmer also venerate her as one of the three ‘Good Daedra’, although her worship has been supplanted by the Tribunal known as Sotha Sil.

Boethiah is worshipped primarily in Morrowind as one of the three ‘Good Daedra’. She/he ‘ate’ Trinimac, and defecated him out as Malacath. This is one of the key events of the Velothi Exodus, which led the Chimer (the ancestors of the Dunmer) to modern day Morrowind. Hir worship was eventually supplanted by the Tribunal known as Almalexia.

Clavicus Vile is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any Tamrielic religion. Despite this, early documents of his worship can be found mainly in High Rock amongst the early Bretons. In them, he is seen as ‘financial backer’ of early kings and queens, and granting dark wishes for the nobility.

Hermaeus Mora is worshipped primarily in Elsweyr, Skyrim, and Valenwood. The Khajiit view him as a driving force of fate, and refer to him as the ‘Tides’. To the Nords he was one of the greatest enemies of Ysgramor, and often tried to trick them into becoming mer. To the Bosmer, he is also trickster, residing in the darkest regions of their forests.

Hircine is worshipped primarily in Elsweyr and Valenwood. The Khajiit revere him for he represents feline cunning and fierceness, and is known as the ‘Hungry Cat’. The Bosmer worship him as the more dangerous side of the forest that helps them with their hunting.

Jyggalag is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any Tamrielic religion. Actually, his cults are virtually nonexistent. Rumors abound that his last remaining followers inhabit the Summerset Isles, where the more ‘open-minded’ Altmer respect the nature of his sphere.

Malacath is worshipped primarily in Hammerfell, Morrowind, Skyrim, and amongst the Orcs, and is also worshipped (as Trinimac) in the Summerset Isles. Before his transformation, he was a god-hero of the Altmer and is still slightly worshipped by them. The Redguards view him as an enemy god that attempted to repel their settling of modern-day Hammerfell. In Morrowind religion, he is one of the ‘Four Corners of the House of Troubles’ and tests the Dunmer for physical weaknesses. In Skyrim, he was an enemy of King Harald and his heirs. To the Orcs he is their god-king because as he was transformed into Trinimac, they were created from the mer that transformed with him.

Mehrunes Dagon is primarily worshipped in Elsweyr and Morrowind. The Khajiit view him as a destructive kitten, and represents children without proper instruction. In Morrowind he is one of the ‘Four Corners of the House of Troubles’ and tests the Dunmer on their survivability, and represents Morrowind’s hostile landscape.

Mephala is primarily worshipped in Elsweyr and Morrowind. To the Khajiit, she/he is represents their Clan Mothers and holds secrets. The Dunmer view her as one of the three ‘Good Daedra’, where she taught them to defeat their many enemies when they were still Chimer by teaching them the arts of assassination. The Morag Tong was founded by her. Hir worship has since been supplanted by the Tribunal known as Vivec.

Meridia was primarily worshipped by the Ayleids of Cyrodiil before their extinction, and nowhere else. To them she represented their fourth element, ‘light’. The ancient enemy of Pelinal Whitestrake, Umaril the Unfeathered, was her champion.

Molag Bal is primarily worshipped in Morrowind. He is the greatest adversary of the Dunmer people as one of the ‘Four Corners of the House of Troubles’. He constantly tries to corrupt and destabilize the Dunmeri race as a whole, and is alleged of populating the land with monsters after seducing the Triune Vivec.

Namira is only worshipped in Elsweyr. To the Khajiit she is the ‘Great Darkness’, and responsible for the corruption of the entity known as Lorkhan.

Nocturnal is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any Tamrielic religion. The earliest accounts of her worship is in Skyrim, where some myths view her as a matron of those who prefer to dwell and walk in the dark.

Peryite is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any Tamrielic religion. He seems to have been a ‘fickly’ deity to the ancient Nedes of Cyrodiil, where the earliest legends mention him are from. At some times he was a benevolent creature that aided slaves, in others a sinister one that killed them.

Sanguine is primarily worshipped in Elsweyr. To the Khajiit he is known as the ‘Blood Cat’, who always acts on every impulse he feels and represents the ‘blood urge’ of the Khajiiti people.

Sheogorath is primarily worshipped in Elsweyr and Morrowind. He is the ‘Skooma Cat’, and represents chaos and the frowning down upon too much structure in their society. In Morrowind he is one of the ‘Four Corners of the House of Troubles’, and tests the Dunmer for mental weaknesses.

Vaermina is one of the few Daedric Princes who has no major role in any Tamrielic religion. Earliest records indicate her worship began in High Rock, amongst early artists and other professions that require applications of creativity.
###Notes On The Daedric Princes
Below is an in-depth look at each of the Daedra Lords, combining well known and obscure facts about these entities in each entry:

**Azura (Twilight Eternal):** Azura is the Daedric Prince of Dawn, Dusk, Twilight, and Prophecy. She is also the Embodiment of Clairvoyance. She is one of the Princes that is considered very benevolent to mortalkind, but her wrath is said to be able to destroy entire lands. Because of this, most of her worshippers venerate her without question and are rewarded beyond pleasure. She is capable of seeing only into the future through her ties with the twilight, and is often associated with hidden beauty. She often takes on the form of a Dunmeri woman wearing a low-neck or topless blue dress and short hair. Daedra called Winged Twilights are her unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is known as Moonshadow, which is blindingly beautiful and colorful, with flowers, waterfalls, trees, and an alleged silver city.

**Boethiah (Mistress of Discord):** Boethiah is the Daedric Prince of Deceit, Conspiracy, and Secret Plots of Murder. He is also the Embodiment of Strife. He is one of the few Princes that constantly shifts between male and female form, but is mostly always a male. He is heavily invested in the politics of the mortal races, and is well known for being indirectly instrumental in the starting of wars between nations; this can be tied to his love for competition and battle. Interesting, he seems to constantly create policies for his worshippers. He often takes on the form of a Dunmeri man wearing red-caped armor and wielding a blade of ebony. Daedra called Hungers are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as Attribution’s Share, a land of maze gardens and labyrinthine towers where politics are intertwined with battle.

**Clavicus Vile (The Wishing Hound):** Clavicus Vile is the Daedric Prince of Power, Wishes, and Pacts. He is also the Embodiment of Covenants. He makes deals with mortals in their hopes for him upholding his bargain, which he does: just in a way that they may come to regret. He is one of the Princes most fond of interfering in the lives of mortals, and is likes the use of irony amongst the wishes he grants. Most of the time, death is an acceptable solution in the deals he makes. His worshippers believe him ruthless, brutal, but truthful and honest in his transactions. He seems to greatly admire those that outsmart him in his deals with them. He often takes on the form of a small boy with horns wearing a nice suit, and with a dog always at his side that he converses with. Daedra called Jinn are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is thought to be called Desideratum, a place of tranquil countrysides and vibrant merchant cities of forever bargaining.

**Hermaeus Mora (Keeper of the Forest):** Hermaeus Mora is the Daedric Prince of Memory, Fate, Knowledge, and Destiny. He is also the Embodiment of Comprehension. He is the holder of all learning, which he is fiercely protective about. Some of his worshippers say that he is capable of subjugating the Time Dragon’s influence, and is able to see both into the future as well as the past. He is associated with woods, which represent untamed and unknown knowledge. He is also well known for presenting powerful tomes of hidden knowledge to mortals, in exchange for the aid of routing out the knowledge he does not possess. He often takes on the form of a mass of grotesque green tentacles, eyes, and a pair of crab-like pincers. Daedra called Seekers and Lurkers are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as Apocrypha, and manifests as an endless library of knowledge from multiple time periods.

**Hircine (Commander of Beasts):** Hircine is the Daedric Prince of Hunting, Beasts, and the Darker Aspects of the Forest. He is also the Embodiment of Predation. He is the creator of all the forms of lycanthropy, who fit perfectly into his sphere: they prey at night and are preyed upon in the morning. He represents the more dangerous aspects of nature, such as the enjoyment of the kill rather than the act of it for substance and the thrill of the chase rather than simply tracking the animal. He often takes on the form of a muscular man wearing a loincloth with the head of a deer and wielding a spear, accompanied by a wolf. Daedra called Stalkers are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as the Hunting Grounds, a realm of great forests and open plains inhabited by fierce animals.

**Jyggalag (Crystal Knight):** Jyggalag is the Daedric Prince of Logical Order, Perfection, and Rigidity. He is also the Embodiment of Intransigence. He is thought to be one of the strongest of the Daedra Lords, and commands many legions in Oblivion. Strangely, his worship is almost nonexistent in Tamriel and few references are made to him in books. Perhaps he has become tired of the Mundus and has redrawn into Oblivion, for even his realm is now inaccessible to mortals. He often takes on the form of a warrior made entirely out of shining crystal. Daedra called the Knights of Order are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as the Silver Prisms, which appears a realm of grey sand and towering buildings of silver crystals, each tiered to sheer perfection.

**Malacath (Patron of the Spurned):** Malacath is the Daedric Prince of Curses, Strength, and the Ostracized. He is also the Embodiment of Acquiescence. He hates physical weakness, and strives to push mortals into becoming stronger than they naturally are. He also seems to have contempt for mental weakness as well, and is often thought to act dumb to fool his enemies. He protects the exiled and those who are looked down upon, like he himself is. He is often the outcast other outcasts turn to for guidance. Daedra called Ogrim are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is known as the Ashpit, a realm of choking air and buildings made out of cinders meant to test the strength of those who enter it.

**Mehrunes Dagon (Four Arms of the Razor):** Mehrunes Dagon is the Daedric Prince of Destruction, Revolution, and Ambition. He is also the Embodiment of Change. He is constantly destroying everything he comes into contact with and is known for his quick-to-anger temperament and slow-thinking mind. He is the force that instills in every mortal to rise against those that lead them, although he may not be directly behind said risings. He often takes on the form of a man with four arms and orange skin wearing a loincloth and wielding a large axe of some sort. Daedra called Clannfears are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is the Deadlands, a realm of black islands, towers, and lava rivers.

**Mephala (Madame at the Loom):** Mephala is the Daedric Prince of Lies, Sex, Secrets, and Murder. Ze is also the Embodiment of Existence. Ze is one of the few Princes that constantly shifts between male and female form, but is usually referred to as female. Hir worshippers view her as the one who oversees life being created and the one who ends it swiftly. This is usually manifested as hir weaving the threads containing the secrets of mortals together so intricately to cut one is to two. She often takes on the form of Dunmer hermaphrodite wearing the attire of an assassin, and wielding a longblade. Daedra called simply the Spider Daedra are her unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is rumored to be called the Web, a place woven out of hidden thoughts. It has always been inaccessible to living mortals.

**Meridia (Sparkle in the Darkness):** Meridia is the Daedric Prince of Life, Energy, and Cleansing. She is also the Embodiment of Purity. She is one of the Princes who is considered kindhearted and benevolent. She has an intense hatred for all manners of undead like vampires and zombies, viewing them as revolting abominations. She supposedly lights the way to the clearing of the mind and body. She often takes on the form of lady glowing with dazzling light or fire. Daedra called Aurorans are her unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is The Colored Rooms, which are a vast space of beautiful multicolor crystals shining intensely.

**Molag Bal (Defiler of Spirits):** Molag Bal is the Daedric Prince of Domination, Tarnishment, and the Enslavement of Mortals. He is also the Embodiment of Sovereignty. He is considered one of the truly ‘evil’ Princes, due to his horrible acts against mortalkind. He has an obsession with souls, and is the creator of soul gems. He is also the creator of the vampire race, who share several of his characteristics. Depraved acts like rape were invented by him, for which he holds no shame. In fact, he feels for none but himself. He often takes on the form of a green reptilian creature adorned with skulls. Daedra called Daedroths and Harvesters are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is Coldharbour, which is just a stigmatized copy of Tamriel.

**Namira (Putrefying Queen):** Namira is the Daedric Prince of Decay, Darkness, and Revulsion. She is also the Embodiment of Entropy. Revolting creatures like insects, spiders, and vermin are considered part of her influence. She is the matron of beggars, who live in vile conditions but do not complain about it. She is considered the second to come from the Void, and is the personification of it’s ability to corrupt individuals. Horrid acts frowned down upon in society is always acceptable to her. She often takes on the form of a beautiful lady who is also a corpse on further inspection wearing a green dress with a sickly creature accompanying her. Daedra called Jermariuns are her unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is the Scuttling Void, a black abyss filled with revolting monsters. It has always been inaccessible to living mortals.

**Nocturnal (The Perished):** Nocturnal is the Daedric Prince of the Night, Stealth, and Shadow. She is also the Embodiment of Obscurity. She is beloved by thieves, because they find hiding places in the shadows she creates. She represents carnal mystery for mortals, which is slowly revealed away through exploration. She is also linked to luck, which is one of her ‘gifts’ on Mundus. Her followers say she is the personification of the Void’s enigmas, and the first to come from it. She often takes on the form of a beautiful lady cloaked in pitch-black robes with ravens on her shoulders. Daedra called Rapinas are her unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is Ebongloam, a realm of perpetual twilight.

**Peryite (Warden of the Equipoise):** Peryite is the Daedric Prince of Tasks, Natural Order, and Pestilence. He is also the Embodiment of Balance. He makes sure that all opposing forces have an equally opposing force moving against it and that everything has a purpose. Most of his ‘blessings’ are actually curses as well, for he always plays both sides and never just one. Diseases are the prime example of this, and it is rumored he is connected to the Thrassian Plague. Some of his worshippers refer to him as ‘the Shadow of Aka’ and he often takes on the form of a green dragon to mock the Time Dragon. Daedra called Vavasours are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is The Pits, a realm of infinite holes in the ground that contains ooze rivers and violent disease storms. It has always been inaccessible to living mortals.

**Sanguine (Reveling Maniac):** Sanguine is the Daedric Prince of Hedonism, Debauchery and Dark Indulgences. He is also the Embodiment of Passion. He is one of the most active Princes in mortal lives, and attempts to liven up what he refers to as our ‘drab and dull existence’. At some times, he is kind and throws extravagant wine and dancing parties. In others, he is self-indulgent and conducts wild, drunken, and bloody orgies. Most fitting, considering he is both the light and dark sides of fun. He often takes on the form of horned red-skinned creature wearing flamboyant robes, with a virgin clinging to his shoulder and a constantly refilling wine glass in his hand. Daedra called Plaisirs are his unique servants. He owns over a thousand realms in Oblivion, collectively known as Sanguine’s Little Pleasures, which are used as pockets of fun for him and his followers.

**Sheogorath (The Learned Lunatic):** Sheogorath is the Daedric Prince of Disorder, Chaos, Capriciousness, and Personality. He is also the Embodiment of Madness. He is one of the most unpredictable Princes; one second a nice gentleman-like fellow and the next a murderous sociopath. Strangely, he is often tied to isolation and ‘knowledge that was not meant to be known’, with both resulting in insanity. His own bizarre words depict himself as ‘born from the corpse of the world-maker’. He often takes on the form of a old man wearing a nice suit, to lead those surprised of the ‘true’ face of madness down the road to insanity. Daedra called Mazken and Aureals are his unique servants. His plane of Oblivion is the Shivering Isles, a realm that only those on their way to lunacy can enter.

**Vaermina (Lady of Visions):** Vaermina is the Daedric Prince of Dreams, Nightmares, Evil Omens, and Torture. She is also the Embodiment of Imagination. She is believed to collect mortal experiences and warp them beyond recognition, creating the tranquil and horrifying realities mortals inhabit while they’re asleep. Signs such as haunting ghosts or a shiver down the spine are also attributed to her, because she is believed to delight in people knowing something bad is about to happen although they don’t know when. She often takes on the form of an old lady with a walking stick accumulating fog around her. Daedra called Truiva are her unique servants. Her plane of Oblivion is called Quagmire, a realm that constantly morphs from one terrifying image to another.
