*[Author’s Note: The fabled ‘Daedric Artifacts of legend are weapons, armor, and equipment either created by or gifted to the Daedric Princes and imbued with vestiges of their power and likeness. There are incalculable numbers of these relics of legend, but I have listed seventeen of these objects corresponding with the Princes that created them. You will also find brief descriptions of these items ‘hidden’ talents as well in this document.]*

###Azura’s Star
Azura’s Star is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact and is usually considered a ‘blessing’ to her followers. It is a soul gem crafted in the shape of a star, and has unlimited uses for those that use it. However, it can only contain white souls. Despite this limitation however, many stories dictate corruptions of the Star that allow it to become capable of trapping black souls. These stories remain unconfirmed at present.
###Dawnbreaker
Dawnbreaker is Meridia’s signature artifact and burns with her intense hatred for the undead. Apparently forged from ‘holy light’, it causes all manners of undead that are struck by it – including vampires – to catch aflame and may cause them to explode, which causes a Turn Undead effect on the remaining undead present. For normal enemies, it just burns them painfully. It is said that the more often the wielder uses it, the more ‘pure’ they begin to feel.
###Ebony Mail
The Ebony Mail is Boethiah’s signature artifact. According to some legends, it was once the attire of the hero-god Trinimac that became pure ebony after it was splattered with the blood of a ‘fallen god’. When the hero-god was eaten by the Prince, the Mail became a symbol of their power. It is worn by those that can lead others, and grants its wearer protection to both fire and magicka, protects them from physical blows, muffles their movements, and may poison attackers who come to close.
###Ebony Blade
The Ebony Blade is Mephala’s signature artifact. Ancient legends say that the Blade was once the weapon of the hero-god Trinimac before his transformation. It became made of Ebony after it was covered in the blood of a ‘fallen god’, and Prince took it as her own. The artifact drains the stamina of its victims and transfers it to the wielder. The Blade is also said to grow even stronger if the wielder murders their close friends.
###Helm of Jyggalag
The Helm of Jyggalag is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact he bestows to mortals. For those that wear the Helm, it clears the mind of all but the most logical of thoughts and everything you do is more orderly, including the things you say. Others will find you more agreeable and likable in this state as well. It – in essence – makes the wearer as ‘perfect’ as they can naturally be. It hasn’t been seen in centuries, in the same manner as its creator’s disappearance, but was described as a crystal crown with a face-mask.
###Hircine’s Ring
Hircine’s Ring is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact and is usually bestowed on those more beast than man. It has the ability to grant lycanthropes of all kinds the ability to transform at will at any time of the day, and not only at night. For normal mortals, it just enhances the senses to that of an animal’s. However, through greater study of it, the Ring may bestow the disease of lycanthropy to those that wish it.
###Mace of Molag Bal
The Mace of Molag Bal is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact and is considered a weapon of ‘evil’. It has the ability to drain both the stamina and magicka of the wielder’s opponent and give it to it’s user, allowing easier dispatching of an attacker. The Mace exhibits a corrupting aura, and the more deaths caused by it the more selfish and cruel the wielder becomes.
###Masque of Clavicus Vile
The Masque of Clavicus Vile is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact. It is said that the Prince gave the Masque, which he used to wear all the time, to the first mortal who outsmarted one of his deals. However, there was one condition: that the Masque would be used for creating more false-truths. It seems that the artifact has inherited its creator’s likeness, for those that wear it find their word’s honeyed and more capable of convincing others.
###Mehrunes’ Razor
Mehrunes’ Razor is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact and his favorite tool for change. According to some legends, the Razor was forged by ethereal beings that gave him the weapon. It is incredibly powerful, as it has the chance to kill anything with a single blow. Those that wield it will always find themselves in positions that advocate destruction or revolution.
###Namira’s Ring
Namira’s Ring is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact she gives to mortals. It functions as a living mirror, and causes the pain and suffering inflicted on the wielder to be also felt in the attacker. It also increases the stamina of the wielder as well. According to myth, the longer the Ring is worn the more repulsive the wielder becomes, even causing revolting acts such as cannibalism that give them strength and heals them.
###Oghma Infinium
The Oghma Infinium is a tome of incredible knowledge that is Hermaeus Mora’s signature artifact. It was created by the Merish god Xarxes, who named it after his wife Oghma. The book bestows incredible learning on those who read it, and then vanishes before the person who acquired it gets to finish it. The book is actually a trap set by the Prince, meant to lure those in the pursuit of hidden knowledge to his realm.
###Sanguine’s Rose
Sanguine’s Rose is the eponymous Prince’s signature artifact he gifts to mortals. It has the ability to summon an uncontrollable lesser daedra that will attack enemies. It appears as an actual or large metal rose, that wilts before another one grows in its place after continuous use. It represents both the fun and bloody sides of Sanguine, and it is said those that study it can eventually learn how to control and change the daedra it summons.
###Skeleton Key
The Skeleton Key is Nocturnal’s signature artifact and is made out of her essence. It has the incredible ability to unlock any door, which makes it highly prized by thieves. It also allegedly has – through intense study – the ability to unlock potential in the wielder, making them dangerously proficient at everything they do.
###Skull of Corruption
The Skull of Corruption is the signature artifact of Vaermina, and is made out of her essence. It is a staff capable of creating ethereal clones of those it is used on, which will then fight for its wielder. During the creation of the clone, it also makes and absorbs copies of the victim’s memories which are sent directly to Vaermina herself. The staff is also said to have a mind of his own, and enjoys the acts of mental torture it inflicts on its victims.
###Spellbreaker
Spellbreaker is the signature artifact of Peryite, and once belonged to the Dwemeri Rourken clan. It appears as an uniquely designed Dwemer shield, and has the ability to protect the wearer from both magical and physical attacks. The shield played an important role in the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, where it is said to have been created by the two combining their abilities before being imbued with the Prince’s power. Due to its balance-like nature, Peryite took it as a representation of his sphere and those that use it for imbalance will find it vanish on them immediately.
###Volendrung
Volendrung is the signature artifact of Malacath, and also once belonged to the Rourken clan; it is in fact the same hammer that the chieftain of the Rourken threw to find a new home to live, the landing spot being Volenfell, or present-day Hammerfell. It appears as an ebony warhammer, but has also been rumored to take on the appearance of a blade. Malacath made the weapon a symbol of his power because the Rourken were outcasts, which fall under his sphere, and only those that feel like or are outcasts may wield it.
###Wabbajack
The Wabbajack is Sheogorath’s signature artifact and was created from his essence. It takes on the form of an ebony staff carved with the ability to change its victims shape, restore their health, or instantly kill them. However, these effects are entirely random and cannot be anticipated. The weapon itself is a tool to make those that wield it insane, due to their attempts to guess its unpredictable outcomes.
