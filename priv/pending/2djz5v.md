[Original and Unaltered Manuscript]

I have always been fond of the Imperial Geographical Society ever since I was a child. Now as an adult, I was able to convince the association itself to allow me to sit down with one of its most prestigious members. After meeting with him, we both agreed to the questioning session at the Arcane University around midnight, because the scholar was a close friend of Archmage Hannibal Traven.

I was sipping a glass of wine when the Argonian came in through the door and sat down. His scales were an unusually pale dark greenish-blue, and his eyes bright yellow. He wore medium armor native to his homeland, and his teeth were sharp. Very sharp. We shook one another’s hands.

*Greetings, Sir! Could You Please Tell Me Your Full Name And Station So I Can Commit It To Record?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** My name is Eis Vuur Warden, formally known as Kaxith-Vel. I am an Argonian obviously, and a historian, writer, and scholar of the Imperial Geographical Society.

*Ah, Thank You For Your Honesty. Um, If You Don’t Me Saying…You Are Rather Pale For An Argonian. And Your Fangs, Along With The Matter Of Having Me Meet You At Night…Are You A Vampire By Any Chance?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** You have guessed correct young scholar, good job. I am in fact a vampire, and very old. How old you say? Well, I was born sometime at the beginning of the Second Era and I’m still alive today, so it would seem to be several millennia. I have watched armies rise and fall over the Ruby Throne, lived through Dragon Breaks, and written essays about the deaths of the Tribunal themselves. It is weird, saying that one has ‘outlived’ a god. But please, do not tell anyone about my…condition. It has been a very closely guarded secret, and I did not mask my appearance today because I believed you would not be frightened by it.

*Trust Me Sir, I Have Seen My Fair Share Of Vampires. Your Secret Is Safe With Me. Regarding Your Mention Of The Tribunal, Did You Know Any Of Them Personally? Have You Met Any Other ‘Infamous’ People In Tamriel?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Ah, I was able to meet Lady Almalexia during my time as a contract-scribe for the Ebonheart Pact. That was so many years ago. While we weren’t ‘close’ in the traditional sense of friendship, we were still good associates. I was quite surprised and saddened to hear about her death at the hands of the Nerevarine. But, I suppose it had to be done. Can’t have suicidal gods running amok now, can we? While I don’t particularly understand the last question regarding other infamous people, I can tell you I have met the sorcerer Divayth Fyr, the Ancient Sage of Solitude, several Emperors, and many more. Members of the Society should always be prepared to meet with powerful figures. It’s in our job description.

*What Exactly Are The Duties Of A Society Member? Do You Enjoy This Profession?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Society members have many duties. First and foremost, we are the ones that chart the environments and history of the peoples of Tamriel. For example, we are the ones that write the Pocket Guides to the Empire, and all of its province-specific derivatives. We also write, draw, and translate essays, novels, glyphs, paintings, and other such things. Something that few people know is that we are also trained to be successful diplomats during our frequent travels to defuse tenuous situations. You never know which province hates you the most until you’re close enough to say hi.

My duties are bit more advanced than the typical member, mostly because of my condition and my longstanding membership. I’m usually handed the most dangerous assignments, ones where there are more than a fifty percent chance of dying. But of course, those are the ones that are the most fun. I hate desk jobs; they make my already boring existence even more boring. But yes, my job is very…interesting, to say the least.

*Are Members Required To Be Able To Perform Multiple Functions?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Ha, what kind of question is that! Of course we are, didn’t you hear me at the beginning? I am a historian as well as a scholar. I have also written many fiction and nonfiction literature for the general populace. I am also a cosmologist, because I was always fascinated by the universe ever since I was a young hatchling. And while I do more things than that, those four are the ones I do frequently. Unless you’re hiring me for something. Shall we begin discussing numbers?

*Ha, No I’m Not Hiring You Sir. How Did You Come To Find Yourself Working For The IGS?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Hmm…I remember it like it was yesterday. You see, I was once a worshipper of the Daedric Prince you know as Peryite. I did some…rather unscrupulous things under his command that I would rather not get into now. However, I caught the vampiric disease known as Serratus Peryiphim while leading a skirmish into the den of some Molag Bal worshippers. Normally, vampires enraged my former master to no end. However, this particular strain had…certain ties to the Taskmaster and because I was one of his most loyal followers he let me live, although I was exiled from his sight for all eternity.

I wandered the Marsh for years without a true purpose, afraid I would eventually be discovered and my unwanted immortality would come to an end by some cutthroat hunter. Due to the impressive Illusion abilities of the Whet-Fang, I made a living doing scribe work for some of my more benevolent cousins by disguising my appearance. But then I caught the attention of some mysterious Imperial gentleman; apparently, my writing skills were very topnotch and he thought I should travel to Cyrodiil to work for the Imperials there. I had been born a slave in Morrowind, and had done writing work for my Dunmeri masters in Deshaan before I escaped with a few Khajiit.

Although I was at first wary of this proposition, I eventually decided to walk down this path. I simply believed I had nothing left to lose besides my life, and I was growing tired of that anyway. I left the Marsh by traveling through the highlands of Murkmire and entered Cyrodiil, where I decided to change my name. When I arrived in the Imperial City, I knew my life would be changed forever. I became a writer for many institutions, and even joined the Mages Guild. Of course I’m no longer a member now, but they have kept my secret safe for all these years and I still help them out from time to time. And then I stumbled onto the Society, and they grabbed my attention.

*How Were You Inducted Into The Society?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Doing the hardest test I’ve ever had to go through. First, I had to rewrite five ancient tomes that were already falling apart and were missing words so they could be reprinted. Then I had to had to paint an accurate picture of Lake Rumare during a storm. And after that, I had to travel to all nine provinces and bring back a sample of each of their environs without damaging a single one. Last but not least they wanted to test my fighting prowess, so I had to fight five wolves at once. I passed out for eight days straight, but it was worth it in the long run.

Or maybe I’m just pulling your leg and all I had to do was talk to the guild’s leader, who sent me out to identify which manuscript out of two was the farce one. Although, I do still have scars from wolf bites on my right arm. They throb from time to time when the weather acts up. Ugh, I must be getting old.

*What Is The Life Expectancy Of A Member Of The Society?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** With all honesty? It’s pretty short. Even for me, and I’m an immortal Argonian vampire with over a thousand years in experience. I can count about fifteen times in the last couple of weeks where I nearly lost my hide. It’s a dangerous job. Probably easily the most dangerous job sponsored by the Empire itself. Well, maybe tied with the Mages and Fighters Guilds.

It’s one of the reasons why I don’t marry. Well, that and other things. You wouldn’t believe the allegations from angry Argonian youngsters about me being their father, though. Thankfully none of them were true.

*Hmm…Is It Alright For Scholars To Have Other Professions Outside Of The Society?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** If you need the septims or want more excitement. I was a member of the Mages Guild for sometime, and was even their expert on conjuration until I faked my death when some of the more bigoted members started getting suspicious. I still have close ties with their leadership though, as you can see it.

I thought about the Fighters Guild. But I rather not get beat up for a living; I rather settle my disputes with words, although I do enjoy a good fight now and then.

*Master Of Conjuration, Eh? Do You Travel To The Outer Realms?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Well…yes. But I shouldn’t speak of that because I would be breaking promises with some rather powerful mages. I knew how to travel to Oblivion with various techniques before, but not with the ease I have now. Most of my writings on Daedra stems from these travels.

*My Last Question, Dear Eis: Would You Ever Cure Your Vampirism And Die A Mortal?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** Not a day goes by when I don’t think that, son. Immortality may sound pleasing at first, but honestly – what would you do with eternity? My parents, my cousins, my entire family is long since dead and returned to the Hist. I can’t travel into the sunlight without exploding into ash. Having my own hatchlings is out of the question; who knows how they will be when they grow up? It is not easy outliving your closest friends, and while you can always make new ones your heart will forever ache over the ones you lost. Son, eternity sucks. Plain and simple. Sometimes, when I’m feeling extremely depressed, I think about standing naked in front of the sun and soaking in its warm embrace for one last time.

But then I think about all the work I’ve done, and well, it stops me. I helped write most if not all of the Pocket Guides, treaties, pamphlets, and other literary works of the Empire. Knowing that I have personally helped advocate peace makes me happy enough to continue on. One day, perhaps I will eventually die. But not today. This old Saxhleel still has a couple more things he needs to write and say.

*Beautiful. The Sun Will Be Coming Up Soon, Sir. Shall We End This?*

**Eis Vuur Warden:** That sounds like a good idea. We will have to speak again, my friend, at a later date. Until then, may you stay moist.

Good Day, Sir. And Good Luck.
