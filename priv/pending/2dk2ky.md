All that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection from certain elements. Even the name Denstagmer is a mystery.
– **Tamrielic Artifacts**

The legendary artifact known as Denstagmer’s Ring is perhaps one of the more mysterious artifacts of Tamriel. However, after listening to stories from the lands of Skyrim, Morrowind, and Cyrodiil (as well as stumbling upon an ancient text in the Imperial Library and contacting some associates) I was able to discover at least some truth behind this famed band.

Denstagmer’s Ring once belonged to the eponymous adventurer of Skyrim during the Merethic Era, who would travel throughout Tamriel servicing those in need of help. Back then, it was a rather normal object and was just a sign of Denstagmer’s wealth. Despite being one of the greatest warriors of that age, Denstagmer hated the enemies he could never defeat: the elements. The Nord was deathly afraid of them; fire could burn him to ashes, lightning could roast him alive, in water he could drown, the wind could knock him off balance, and ice could freeze him solid. So Denstagmer decided to go on a quest to find a way to make himself invulnerable to the elements, which would make himself nigh-invincible.

He traveled the land desperately in his search, studying with mages at great length and attempting alchemic brews. Eventually, his findings led him to summon Peryite, the Daedric Prince of Natural Order. Denstagmer believed that Peryite would be able to grant him his sought after immunity due to the Prince’s love for balance. Peryite surprisingly agreed to his proposition, as long as he promised him his soul in return. Denstagmer, his quest for invincibility consuming him, agreed to the terms and the Taskmaster imbued his ring with the power to negate the elements.

Knowing nothing barred death could defeat him know, the Nord traveled to a conclave of rogue mages in the wilderness to test out his new invulnerability. When one of them blasted him with fire, he merely shrugged it off and struck him down. The second attempted to throw an ice spike at his heart, but it shattered before it reached his skin. The Nord laughed, and began to think of himself as a god.

As Denstagmer went to strike the last mage, his enemy hit him with a lightning bolt that tore through his flesh, a mortal wound. As the adventurer laid there on the ground, bleeding out and in shock that his ring did not work, the mage transformed into Peryite himself. The Daedric Prince sneered at Denstagmer, and told him that while the ring was able to make the wearer invulnerable to the elements, there was also a high chance that it would fail. He went on to say that all good things must have bad consequences, for the balance must always be upheld.

And so Denstagmer died, and his soul was cursed to roam The Pits for all eternity for trying to disturb the balance of the world. Peryite collected Denstagmer’s ring, and now the Prince sends the accursed band to Tamriel on purpose: a trap, for those that believe they are above the Natural Order.
