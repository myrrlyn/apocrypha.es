The massive root system of the Hist burrowed and stretched and coiled throughout the blackness of the night sky, feeling the very fabric of reality as it suddenly brushed against a mass of braided fur and grabbed it thoughtfully. The Third Moon revolves and sees the grabber, and the Hist acknowledge his blissful state and greet.

**GREETINGS.**

Massive streams of picture-thought-mathematics-songs puncture into the Third Moon’s atmosphere, but are absorbed into its sugary soil and the Mane smiles.

“Greetings dreaming tree soggy mud lizard make. Third Moon glows sweet bright feels bump tree hello respond?”

The massive root system shakes in a thoughtful and pleasant manner, letting go of the braids as it starts to grow backwards in good manners.

**FINALLY, GREET.**

“Ha, others rude dreaming tree discouraged Aurbis no longer polite please don’t be. Thinking little?”

**MUCH, INDEED.**

The beings revolve and face the corrupted and deteriorating face of Revenant, thinking thoughtfully. The Mane turns back to look at the Hist, staring at the tree with an expression that bended the spectrum of colors and sounds across his form and the Hist feel his lunar presence emanate in their roots.

“Lunar magicka sees future cubs still very still in darkness. Jode and Jone both dark gone so I ponder this.”

The Hist coils a part of its massive root system as it hears these words as it began to ponder with the Mane for what seemed like hours over what he had just said. Too many variables, so few expressions. The tree absorbs excess sugar through its roots and sighs.

**WHY?**

“Mane symbol for the Khajiiti but more and more and more. South dwellers march desert fall jungle fall, Mane says time. Time to hide away. Brothers coming.”

**…MUSING.**

“Thinking much good nice change. Dreaming tree share respond?”

**DEAD STEPS, MAKE WAY?**

“Dead sugar makes for dead stomach.”

**THEN…?**

“Brothers come. Mane loses time, dead sugar. Stone floats up, finds moon. Time to hide away. See respond?”

**MEANT, NOT.**

“Oh? What meant please explain.”

**MAKE WAY, DEAD STEPS?**

“Ah. Perhaps maybe sure not. Brothers come but not afraid Third Moon rises always.”

The Hist and the Mane look down towards Nirn after growing tired of the desolate face of Revenant. The planet’s face is a blur to them. Perhaps they are too far up, or the world looks differently in their eyes. Hist takes two roots and places them on either side of the globe. The Mane stares.

“Third Moon pondering explained. Dreaming tree share time to share please respond.”

**WATCHING, WONDERING, WORKING, WARRING, WAKING NINE.**

“The first?”

**THE CENTER.**

“And the second?”

**RED JEWEL.**

“And the third?”

**HOONDING.**

“And the fourth?”

**FIGHTER POET.**

“And the fifth?”

**TALK GOD.**

“And the sixth?”

**THE BLACKBIRD.**

“And the seventh?”

**WALK-BRASS.**

“And the eighth?”

**YOU.**

“And the ninth?”

**…IRRELEVANT.**

“Irrelevant nothing is.”

**DEBATEABLE.**

Third Moon and the Hist float there for several phases, silent. Then the Mane smiles and the massive Root System of the Hist shakes. The two redraw from Nirn.

“Always fun talking you.”

**HMPH, HA.**

And so the Third Moon went back to its graceful orbit and the Hist redrew into the Void, both learning the old lesson of even when confronted with something unlike themself they could still always laugh.
