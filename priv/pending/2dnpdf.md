Chapter 3 - What Was Forgotten

-----------------------------

The inquisitive will wonder why it is that our Mistress takes the waters of our minds, mixing them with the murky creatia that she herself is.


I tell you, it is so we remember. We sleep to forget the truth, but our dreams are built on fragments of reality.


Our Mistress has been collecting memories since the un-times of the dawn. The Aldmer where not wrong in thinking we once were more than we are now, before we had the soul of the void thrust upon us. We are subgraded and divided. Our memories reflect this subgradience and division.


The Mistress is a collector, gathering pieces to a divided and forgotten picture.


She collects, so we may remember.


The uninitiated fear our Mistress. The initiated know it is not her that is worthy of terror.
