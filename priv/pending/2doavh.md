*By Friar Ergalla*

I am a lover of spirits, a connoisseur of cocktails, a humble friar and man of the world.  I came of age on the streets of Wayrest, enraptured by the vibrant tavern culture that reached out to an orphan like myself who wanted to be a man before he knew what that meant; though I eventually cleaned myself up into a man of the cloth, I never lost my love for the drinks that were to be found in such gathering places, or rather the meaning of such libations. Drink is simply the catalyst which moves men to share their joys and sorrows, the tavern or cornerclub or mead hall the medium in which we come together. Men and elves have many differences, but a good brew is blind to these things.

In this series, I will be exploring the drinks and taverns of Tamriel at large, describing tavern culture, unique spirits, and the role which drink has played in each province's history. The contents are as follows:

1. High Rock - The Muddy Boar, The Wayrest Public House, and the Ykalon microbreweries; *The Spirituality of Spirits* and *A Game of Drinks*

2. Skyrim - Candlehearth Hall, Pineheight Skete, and the Reach Beer March; *Milk of Kyne* and *Strong Drink for Strong People*

3. Morrowind - The Covenant, Molag Amur Cellar, and The Pilgrim's Flask; *The Cornerclub Crawl* and *Where Did Those Names Come From?*

4. Cyrodiil - Golden Grapes Winery, Rutschan Lodge, and the County Leyawiin Chateau; *Rice Wine and Root Tonics: Cyrodiil's Unconventional Alcohol* and *What Did Tiber Septim Drink?*

5. Valenwood - Broken Coast Fermentory, Falinesti Hanging House of Humors, and the Unnamed Bar at Southpoint; *Drinking With Y'ffre: Bosmeri Alcohol and Religion* and *Fermented Pig's Milk and Other Animal Products: An Acquired Taste*

6. Hammerfell - Hegathe Dura Truqe'hel Tomba Ajcea, The Dragontail Debate Hall, and the Empourium of Rihad; *These Drinks Are Flammable: How a Tavern Sparked the Revolt on Stros M'Kai* and *Cactus-Water Communion*

7. Elsweyr - The Hair of the Cat, Orc's Rest, and Sugar; *The Place of Drink in the Land of Sugar* and *A Sweet Solution*
