**2nd Sun’s Dawn, 4E 199**

**Drusus Varo, Overseer of the Ascadian Isles Expedition**

No dreams tonight. Leaving me under the illusion that I can rest easy. Sadly I have to resist this illusion.

My crew thinks I stopped writing. But instead I have maximized my effort to hide this journal from any prying eyes. Everyone falls asleep at night while I pretend to. Then I retrieve this journal in the darkness and only light the lamp once it’s open on my desk. This is because I have relocated it. I won’t reveal my hiding place, even here. In case I am careless and leave this out one night, at least I can prevent my future entries from leaking. Though I can’t say I benefit from the lack of sleep.

We spent the day constructing a crude entrance the next canton, without entering yet. The northern side had crumbled so as to expose the inner network of corridors and canals. But the resulting rubble blocked the entrance to the canal, as well as sinking the bridge.

We grappled both sides of the gap with a rope ladder attached to an iron anchor. Easier said than done (and infinitely less frustrating). After several attempts, Ervis assured that the anchor was safely embedded in the clay and the ladder was secure. Anything to get my mind off the other things. Tomorrow we can descend from the first ladder and use the clay debris as a causeway to reach the second ladder, entering from above water level.

Divines, Daedra, living gods, I don't much care who. I just hope they keep us safe.
