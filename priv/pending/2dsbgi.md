**3rd Sun’s Dawn**

Lideg,
I received the second wedding present early this morning, but why have you not responded to my last two notes? Have you left me? This is the wedding. At twilight, we will take the final steps to unite you and everyone else into something greater. To bring our influence to that which requires it. Have you not forgotten? Please reply to me.

Love,

Amaya

**3rd Sun’s Dawn, 4E 199**
**Ascadian Isles Expedition, Vivec**

**Report 18.1: Location 5.1**

Approx. coordinates: 28672, -86016

Chambers: 5 (estimate, severe dilapidation)

Objects:

State: 1 not submersed/poor, 2 partially submersed/poor, 3 partially submersed/dilapidated, 4 submersed/dilapidated, 5 submersed/dilapidated (assumed)

Object 1: location 2, class container/wood, state poor/3 pieces, net lng. 2.98 ft., net wt. 70.03 lb., text false, portable false (heavy)

Object 2: location 2, class container/wood, state poor/5 pieces, net lng. 5.04 ft., net wt. 50.23 lb., text false, portable false (heavy)

Object 3: location 2, class NA, state NA, net lng. NA, net wt. NA, text NA, portable NA

Notes: The chamber count is an estimate because what we assume to be the lowermost chamber is completely blocked off, save one small section accessible through a hole in the floor. Object 5.1.2.1 is a chest and object 5.1.2.2 is a wardrobe. We concluded not to collect them due to danger from another object and a lack of text or preservation. Object 5.1.2.3 is both the presence of and remaining ectoplasm from an unidentified apparition, informally defined by a crew member as “Ancestral Ghost.” Object 5.1.2.3 materialized when object 5.1.2.1 was opened.
