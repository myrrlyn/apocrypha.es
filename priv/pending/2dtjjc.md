*This is a transcription of a Black Book the Dragonborn gathered for me. Obviously, it was too dangerous to keep here in Tel Mithryn, so I gave the original back to the Dragonborn. He seems to handle Mora's work better than my idiot apprentice. Regardless, I think this has interesting implications about the Daedra and other Spirits in the Aurbis. Enjoy.

Do you see the world? It is a Field of Flowers blossoming under the Summer Sun, seeking after an unreachable light further from them than they could imagine.

The Flower of Reality goes through Seasons: A Season for Rest, a Season for Life, a Season for Death, a Season for Strife.

The Petals unfold, each a waking dream in The Dreamer's imagination, a fragment of his lost desire. He watches with desperation, waiting for the blossom to become fruitful. In the Fruit lies the Seed, and through the Seed comes Restoration, the only cure to his wounds. 

But where did the Flower come from? How did the Stem find the strength to support the Head? How did the Petals know to seek the Sun? 

The Flower did not choose what Petals it could have. It could not pick their colors or define their shapes. It only knew that it must have them to seek the Sun, and that from the Sun would come healing. It therefore generated as many Petals as it could in the hope that one of them would bring the Seed.

Perhaps one Petal will see that Love Lies Bleeding before the season ends and the Flower Wilts. Only time will tell. Even so, the Field of Flowers will continue to grow under the Summer Sun, and maybe some day they will finally cross pollinate. Maybe they already have.
