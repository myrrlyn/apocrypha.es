**4th Sun’s Dawn, 4E 199**
**Drusus Varo, Overseer of the Ascadian Isles Expedition**

We found Wraithguard.

I’m writing this outside, to the first rays of sun. No sleep for me. We found Wraithguard! No trouble from Dreughs either. But I am nervous, very nervous. We hid the gauntlet while unseen. Like the location of this journal, I am not writing Wraithguard’s hiding place.

But damn it. A few people were already awake, when we walked in the tent next to each other all tired and shabby-looking. They were nobodies really—at least no “Synod” anywhere. But I don’t like the way they eyed us. Judgmental and awkward, as if they had figured something out while we were gone. But I waited for them to go back to sleep or leave, and my journal is secure. Still, I wish we had been a bit quicker.

Mehra told me not to worry about the ones who saw us, saying “they are probably thinking something different from what you are worried about.” What is that supposed to mean. She also acted like something was funny. I’m probably overthinking this, but still damn it damn it damn it.

Oh, I think I get it. Good grief. Mental note to my crew:

You’re all very immature. What if I told you we were actually out securing a magical gauntlet with Vivec’s soul trapped inside? I mean that particular Dunmer isn’t hard to look at but come on there is important stuff to do.

 ~~They’re just upset because they can’t get any.~~ Well that’s one less thing to worry about. Azura have mercy on us.

Well, the day is wasted by another big ash storm. Not wasted, actually. It gives us time to recuperate and possibly gather more information. And amazingly enough, the other mages show no outward affectations about the death of Lideg and Ervis. Cirelmo’s ward dutifully surrounds the tent like it always has; Vira still records time to the digit. Whatever these freaks are planning, they don’t want us dead. Not now at least.

But some instances are new to me. For one, the post-dream surges of anger or melancholy have drawn out in length. I struggle against unnatural emotions for hours after waking, sometimes on their own even; a couple minutes at noon or a moment in the evening. At first I took them for an outcome of my growing fatigue.

But then I realized that my anger was triggered by specific people. And these people were increasing in number. I had always dealt with rage towards the “Synod” after a dream. But then I began to feel it around Dar’Jiima. Now Serard and Maleen as well.

If it’s really bad, I hear the strange voice. I can’t describe it (can’t even tell if it’s male or female) because each time it changes ever-so-slightly in pitch and tone. I just hear isolated words so far, though some turn up more often. “Heart.” “Skin.” “Weapon.” “Banish.” Sounds desperate, but very captivating.

And Mehra tells me she gets the same voice thing. In fact. I might have overheard Nihada and Yurgol talking with that other Imperial whose name I can’t remember. About strange voices in the morning and evening. I hope my acting skills didn’t fail me when I told them we can’t afford superstitious nonsense.

And before I get ahead of myself, it is definitely not the voice that came out of Keening. I would hardly call that one a voice; more of an audible aura if you will. And that was also localized to the blade itself. It sends chills up my spine when I think about it, but the information from my last couple dreams kills any coincidence. Someone is trapped in that blade. And before I verify my historical knowledge with Mehra, all I can say is that I suspect something insane.

Either way, all the forces greater than us have made their point clear: there’s no escape. Mehra and I have decided that the way out of this madness is to find the source and destroy it. Our latest guesswork says that while the one voice belongs to Azura, the other belongs to Amaya.

We don’t know Amaya’s true identity. The question is whether or not this identity matters. As I said, my latest dreams are leading me to believe the worst. This Amaya used something to soul-trap three beings into three tools of Kagrenac.

And Amaya was imprisoned, by his or her own will, within the Ministry of Truth. Whether this is the same Amaya to whom Lideg was writing, a different being given the same name, or a ghost, is beyond me.

I might be out on a limb here, but there is the theory about how each member of ALMSIVI died. The implications then, about Amaya's identity... It's in my brain. Why can't I write it. My stupid left hand is shaking all over. And I'm feeling angry at people again. It's Azura's voice nagging me this time.

If Amaya is who I think it is, what happened?

Daedric Prince of dawn and dusk, I can hear you. I need another hint please.
