**8th Sun’s Dawn, 4E 199**

**Drusus Varo, Overseer of the Ascadian Isles Expedition**

It took me a while to realize. One by one, Amaya convinced them all while speaking through Moon-and-Star ring, until I was angry at my whole crew. But the ward stopped this anger. Now I think it’s best to just accept. Forgiveness is a powerful trait.

~~Oh gods, how can this be happening? I told myself, I promis~~

I’ve learned more in these couple days than I had during all the rest of the expedition. Amaya will provide the means to cleanse Azura’s tyranny from Resdayn. The Prince of Dawn and Dusk will be banished to the waters of Oblivion forever, until the next forever at least.

~~Stop. This is the aftermath. I’m weak. So weak. Pathetic. Like my missing hand. This is the aftermath, not a new story. NOT A NEW S~~

Amaya is the hero, the observing heart, because I am as the others and can no longer observe. The Three are the thieving weapon-tools, because to embrace deceit is to benefit from it. I, and we, are the skin, so the mundane may be the conduit to the fall of the transmundane.

The star opens the door. Together, the great simulacrum We-And-It will defeat Azura with the world as an observer. The Dawn and Dusk will yield to Day.

~~T A NEW STORY NOT A NEW STORY NOT~~

Where is Mehra?

~~Don’t go after her, you’re not ready. Wait.~~

I’m confused.

~~Just wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wa~~

No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

~~I’m tired. Sleep and dream.~~

Where is Mehra?
