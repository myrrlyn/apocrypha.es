**9th Sun’s Dawn, 4E 199**

**Drusus Varo, Overseer of the Ascadian Isles Expedition**

I’m sure my handwriting looks a lot neater in this entry. That’s because after I told Mehra about my dream, she reminded me of something I had forgotten during the storm: Wraithguard. We checked to make sure it was still in its hiding place. Sure enough, it was there waiting for us. Emanating that strange sound (which I can only assume is Vivec trapped inside).

But after listening to the hum for a couple seconds, I became dizzy. My head swam and I collapsed to my knees. Azura spoke to me. I honestly couldn’t repeat her words, as these godly voices don’t make their messages in the same way that we do. Sometimes Azura talks over her own voice, or uses silence to imply a message. This all blends together into something perfectly clear.

So with that in mind, Azura made this sharp silence at me, indicating that we would definitely be using Wraithguard in the near future. I guess we needed more spoon-feeding so another migraine-inducing silence told us to put the glove on now.

We didn’t know which one of us was to wear it. I was about to try first, but then it got through my thick skull that Wraithguard is a right gauntlet. So Mehra tried it. Too big for her, and while I have faith in the magical fitting powers of a legendary artifact like this, there was no indication of the gauntlet… Working, I suppose. Not sure what I expected at the time.

It was worth a try. I slipped my empty wrist stump into the gauntlet. And then I took it right back out, because my phantom fingers were twinging really badly. No, this wasn’t the feeling of a sympathetic hand. I tried again. More like someone else’s hand, sending nervous information to me. And this “intruder hand” was writhing in torment. Balling into a fist and splaying out.

I looked away and waited patiently to see if the sensation passed. It did not. Mehra made a face like a ghost had walked through her. I looked and saw Wraithguard, balling into a fist and splaying out again. It was no longer mere feeling. So I stopped moving my hand. And my hand stopped moving. My right hand. Wraithguard.

I followed my instinct. I entered the tent and announced my plans for tomorrow. I said this is it. I said tomorrow, we would finally assemble the We-And-It, drive the Dawn and Dusk from Morrowind, and begin a new story of infinite Day. Then I waved my new hand back and forth like an idiot to show everyone. Aside from this, I dearly hope that tomorrow is the day to end it all. We can return to our own stories once we clear this aftermath.

Well now I’m using Wraithguard to write this entry. So many years of training my left hand and the right one still feels ~~right?~~ more natural. It’s as if a long-time void has been filled. No, more than filled. I feel like a man of greater power. Maybe even a bit like a god?

Oh who am I kidding. I will always be a mortal human being. There’s no need to be anything more.
