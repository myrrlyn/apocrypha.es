Dark is the room, and in the center a forgotten god. 

Deep is the shade of his skin, and his eyes empty.

Long ago was his body mutilated, and his children taken.

Impotent is his form, but not yet his essence.

***Cess, Oht, Geth, Iya, Tayem, Oht. Ekem, Roht, Geth, Oht. Seht, Yoodt, Meht.***

Dark is the mind, and in the center a forgotten thought.

Deep is the well of his imagination, and the shadows of comprehension approach.

Long ago was this thought delivered, by echo off the Listening-Brass in his brother's triumph against the Dawn.

Insignificant in its formulation, but never in its nucleus.

***Ekem, Geth, Oht. Seht, Yoodt, Meht. Ekem, Roht, Geth, Oht. Cess, Oht, Geth, Iya, Tayem, Ayem, Neht, Seht.***

Dark is the way the King walks, littered with dissonant ideas.

Deep is the abyss a misstep would cost him, and he never was one to walk true.

Indeed it was long ago he fell. That which lingers never stays forever.

A mathematical stone-shape. A stumbling block. And he stares into the truth of it.

***Meht, Iya, Neht, Yoodt, Seht, Oht, Neht, Ekem. Payem, Lyr, Yoodt, Seht. Oht, Neht, Ekem. Ekem, Quam, Yoodt, Ayem, Lyr, Seht. Zyr, Ekem, Roht, Oht.***
