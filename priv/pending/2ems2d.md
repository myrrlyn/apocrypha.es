*Dunmer of Morrowind describe the Red Year*
***
**Foreword**

*When I originally decided to write this accounting of the Red Year, I elected to travel across Morrowind and speak to the Dunmer people themselves. I sought first-hand accounts and personal views about the cataclysmic event. I felt that if I simply did the research in the library stacks at the College of Winterhold, I wasn't really telling the tale that needed to be told. What struck me as I moved from city to city, town to town, camp to camp is that all of the Dunmer I met shared an incredible bond of sheer courage and unshakable faith. So what began as a chronicle of one of the worst events in the history of Morrowind became something altogether different, the celebration of a people who can never be defeated.*

Erene Llenim

Seyda Neen

I met Erene in the Temple of Azura in Baan Malur in 4E 08, where he had holed himself up after becoming fearful of the outside world.

"I was on my boat as usual, hauling the day's catch of Silverside Perch when I fell over and the boat violently shook from side to side. I wondered if the underside of the boat had hit some coral, or if I had felt the shockwave of an earthquake in the Sea of Ghosts, when out of the corner of my eye, I saw utter destruction. A plume of smoke and ash maybe two miles high had left the Red Mountain and cast a dark shadow over Vvardenfell as far as the eye could see."

"The House of Troubles must have cast an abhorrent spell upon me, for instead of sailing west to Baan Malur I turned back towards the island where carnage was abrupt."

"I moored my boat back at Seyda Neen, where the whole town was in panic. The tradehouse owned by the Altmer Arrille was engulfed in flames, the Census and Excise office was beyond recognition in ruins and a large rock, that I presume had fallen as debris from the mountain, had landed upon the lower part of the Bosmer, Fargoth."

I asked him if he had any more information to give, but I didn't get an answer to my question, and left him to the priesthood to help tend to his mental wounds.
