&gt;#Book II: Dathfliin Grieves And His Crew
&gt;#|BOOK TWO, AS RECORDED BY THE IMPERIAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY|

**Three months later. First Captain Dathfliin Grieves stands on the stern of the NVN Tesaloricus, and gazes down on the legion of men and women that are laid out before him. He addresses them in his famous speech now known as** ***“The Naming of the Legends”*** **.**

“Today I have gathered a pact of heroes! For that is what you loyal citizens of the Empire are. There is no here that have not heard the tales they sing of you all, in this land that Saint Alessia forged from blood and gore into the Peace of Royalty. And you are all brave, incredibly so. When I asked for each and everyone of you to join me on my quest to save my father, I only received shouts of approval. Even when faced with the deadly Seas of the Void you do not stare away, but look it head on.

My father once told me that it is the heart of the man that allows him to stand faithful in the presence of a god. He told me that the gods themselves are jealous of mortals who hold such courage and bravery in their hearts. And when I look down at you, from this ship that will sail forever more in the minds of men and mer and bet, do you know what I see? I see a host of men and women that make the Et’Ada green with envy of the tales of their mighty deeds! I see warriors who defeated their enemies with their own skill and power, and not that of another! I see souls that will stay immortal without walking in heaven! I see you, legends, I see and I hear and I breathe each and every one of you. And I weep because never before have I seen such a crew. Such a crew that is so beautiful that the very Heart of Tamriel and its Emperor cannot even gaze upon your faces without feeling even the slightest tinge of jealousy.

Those same faces I stand before and see today, and I will allow the tears to flow down my cheeks in their presence. I see you Mojito, the Last Man of Akavir, who invented the food wrap that helped combat the Plague. I see you Relyn the Mad, who is also known as the Sap Rider, insane Dunmer Cider-Maker who gained dominion over sap-magic by charming a grove of Hist to sleep with poison. I see you Thricer-Ook, Spearman of the Marshes, who invented the famed halberd Sordak that could pierce through the very fabric of nothing and warp it. I see you Mdnthrvst of the Star Flung East, Mage of Twilight, who stoked the winds to forbid the rising darkness of the south. I see you Sef Witch-Hunter of High Rock, who sung her tongue back into her mouth. I see you Nautil Dread, who murdered the Good King of the Frozen Forest with no hands but still wielded a blade. I see you Aviénne the Breton, of Southern Regal Born, who captured the famed snow-whales of the north by growing wings. I see you Dark Intoness, Nightblade of Nocturnal, who became shadows when you finally chose to hide from the world. I see you Xanius the Alphabetuer, who named so many things your words became law when you spoke them. I see you Krognaz gro-cath, son of Malacath, who became the Myrr’d Lyn and rescued many Orcs from suffering. I see you Dovahkiin, who has been known as one or two or even three, but your form no one can ever remember. I see you Octavius of the Purple Game, who was able to make the sky rain names. I see you High Deadite, whose face rotted in your sleep and now allows you to breath death itself. I see you Ner, Warrior-King of Adac, who can burn fire. I see you Hollan Mark, Kothri Shield-Brother of the Ice Tribes, who became like snow to destroy the blizzards. I see you Bis son of Fy son of Cui the Cook, who once killed a dragon by eating it without salt. I see you Va-Ru-Nu, who tempted the ocean and became the wife of all the seas. I see you Unprovided Witch Spectra, who would share the whole world and everything in it except your own name. I see you S’Wag, also known as the Flip Master, who used your mythical acrobatics to steal locks from the Moon. I see you Iizyoldein, who took on the name of the Dragon Priest of old despite being lizard and learned his craft. I see you Syth, the Lord of Trolls and King of Stone. I see you Night Hawk, dark-shadowed flight on the sky, who some name the son of Kyne. I see you Oribel, who used the Wild Hunt to fight off the forces of the Huntsman and roared like spring. I see you Pops, who gained that name for holding up a mountain that began to fall on your village. I see you Xenopos, who turned the very waters into a force of vengeance for the murdering of your tribe. I see you Mus Orez, who has the terrific habit of disappearing and reappearing in times of great need. And I see you Ot, who sailed around the continent bearing food for all that occupied Tamriel.

Haha, now I laugh as I see some of you try to remain a bit more anonymous by hiding you faces. Who knew such legendary men and women could be so shy? Please show us your face Nev Solitha, the Archmage who etched the flow of time on a hawk’s feather. And show us yours Doc Uch, who outran your shadow. And show us yours Anshar the Star-Warlock, who summoned a meteor to defeat an army. And show us yours Sudon the Withstanding, who drowned in wasabi and climbed out a giant. And show us yours Obli Vi Ous, who often forgets why you’re fighting but you continue to fight anyway. And show us yours Prince Nona, the only Maormer present here today, who can summon the shades of one hundred and thirty-three serpents. And show us yours Kia, the Know-It-All, who read the contents of the Imperial Library in its entirety and retained it all.  And show us yours Ajiika, who once cut through an entire battlefield of gore and came out clean on the other side. And show us yours Dinsmurf, who some say has Dwemer blood because how else can you create such works? And show us yours Sock the Toe, who used artwork to walk the roads of eternity.

In the back I see the quiet Viscountess N, who wrote her vision into reality and there it still stays. And Maering of Clan Bear-Poker, who cracked glaciers wherever he stepped. And Zini, Shield-Thane of Ebonarm the Memory-Lord. And Laurel Thalasa, who rejected her nobility to run in the wilds as a Nymph. And Nigel, who as a man named all the species of birds. And Freurn of the Double Zero People, who burned a forest with ice. And Crikey, whose laugh made true anger itself break into smile. And Txaj the Imga, who writes texts so beautiful they cried. And Earnest Frank, who can use mathematics as weaponry. And Learfis the Blind, who can smell the blood in your opponents to make up for your blindness. And Dica the Cold, who some say was born from icy dragon’s breath. And Aeo, who tamed the star birds of myth and rode them. And Gilan, whose voice was taken from you but not before you destroyed the entire bloodlines of those that did it. And Numinit, the only Dwemeri automaton capable of full communication. And Black Fire, who wrote history so fast he burned the parchment in eight different eras. And Falip the Defiler, whose mythos corrupts the souls of all that come in contact with it but at the same time making them better. And Ordo Corvus, the Raven-King, who's jokes mended the Aurbis. And Darsius of Cid Hartha, one of the last Ayleids, who we had to convince to tag along because you were quite tired of fighting.

But last and certainly not least is the Ghost of Merry Eyesore the Elk, who was dismembered by empty speech by the Spirits of NO and reborn by the Council of IT IS because you wanted to come along on this journey.

But do not believe that just because I ended with Old Man Antlers that I have forgotten the rest of you that stand before me, because I have not and never will. There are many more of you standing here today, and you are all legends in your own right. For those I have not named today are also the ones whose stories are the more quiet, and we all know it is those stories that reach the most ears.

Today we stand here for a common cause, we men and women of the Glorified Reman Dynasty! We have all come here to rescue one of our from Nirn’s Starry Heart, my father, Bethalamet! A man who right now is suffering at the hands at the gods we call ‘Daedra’, and has been for the last nine years!

But we will not have it! For we represent the unity that Saint Alessia fought for! We represent the unity that the Emperor’s great-grandfather, Reman son of Hrol, fought for! Who has ever bested us when we are united? The Sload and their Plague we swept from this land and sunk! The Akaviri we ran back into the sea!

So I say this, in front of not just you but the provinces you all represent – we are not weak! We are Tamriel. We may be mortals, but today we will show the Aedra and the Daedra and every other Et’Ada that reigns in the heavens that we can FIGHT! Starting on this day, not out of ignorance or arrogance, we will sail the Seas of Oblivion and the Void and we will make the Gods lower themselves to talk to us mere mortals. And they will listen!

WE ARE UNITY! WE ARE SODALITAS TESLORICA!

FOR BETHALAMET! FOR TAMRIEL!”

**All of Sodalitas Teslorica raise their fists into the air and shout in unison, and today no language needs to be translated for they all speak the same words albeit in different tongues.**

“TAMRIEL!”

“TTZIXIXEL!”

“TAAZOKAAN!”

“TAM! RUGH!”

“MERETH!”
