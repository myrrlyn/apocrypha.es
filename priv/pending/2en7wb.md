*Father, Mother, Sister, Brother,*

*I don’t think we’ve ever met each other.*

*But how can that be if we lived together?*

*Have our eyes been shut forever?*
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Turn and turn and turn again,*

*We know the what but not the when.*

*Look and see if they’re pass the bend,*

*Hiding in the place they have went and rend.*
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Father, Mother, Sister, Brother,*

*I’m sure we’ve never ever met each other.*

*You were gone before I was born,*

*But we still have your stuff, useless and worn.*
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Turn and turn and turn again,*

*We see the what but not the why.*

*Where else in the Aurbis can you hide?*

*Have you broken the rules you must abide?*
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Father, Mother, Sister, Brother,*

*You know that I am not a worrier.*

*But why did they just up and leave?*

*They didn’t even say goodbye to me.*
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Turn and turn and turn again,*

*We see the what but not the how.*

*The laws of reality you no longer bow.*

*You left because you were so caught up in the now.*
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Father, Mother, Sister, Brother,*

*I must confess before I start to suffer.*

*Was your existence your corrupter?*

*I don’t think we’ll ever see another.*
