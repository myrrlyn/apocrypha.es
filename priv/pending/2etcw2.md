My head was once so full of confidence, in my youth I would leap from the highest spires of Alcaore into the water that sat below, without a worry of being hurt by the jagged rocks that sat beneath the waves that craved the sweet taste of my blood.

I once felt compassion and gave generously to the poor, in hope that it would somehow help them live a more fulfilling life. But now when I see the homeless, I can only see the hatred built up behind their eyes that has festered there for more years than I can count. I became wary to not have a shiv resting inside my body when my back is turned away.

The bruises upon my belly? Yes, they hurt. Everynight he presses on them, hoping to inflict insufferable pain on me and hoping for a reaction. I have seen the seed of life leave his flesh and bones more times than I care to admit.

He says that without him, I would be a nobody. I would not have the fame I now wield, I would not have the ability to decide the fate of a thousand men at a snap of my fingertips. And as much as I hate to admit it, he is right.

If not for him, I would still be in the services of that flea-ridden cat. "A loyal Servant of the Sacred Dibellan Arts" he would call me. He could disguise what I was all he wanted; everyone from the old man with no legs, to the young child who could barely utter a word.

I was a lady of the night; a wench who could satisfy a Colovian's lust; A DISEASE-RIDDEN WHORE!!

And I loved it. I would run through the streets of the city wearing not but the skin I was in, hoping some desperate man would need his spear polishing clean. Sometimes I would be taken to a house full of skooma enthusiasts, where we would frolick amongst each other till the morning sun.

I met him in the middle of a road in the badlands of the Alik'r desert. Not the cat, but the man I am with now. I had been abandoned by a Niben noble; who shall remain nameless, for I value what caoc existence I live now to be somewhat worthwhile. He was a King, or so he said, that had been taken captive by some cats he owed a lot of gold to. It was as if fate had brought us together. We fornicated under the light of Masser and he was the best one yet. My red diamond had been so soothing to his spear that the seed of life was shared among the eggs of my flesh.

I am expectant, and he pressures me to be rid of the spawn; but the child of royalty and a whore could go on to great things. Maybe even build an Empire.
