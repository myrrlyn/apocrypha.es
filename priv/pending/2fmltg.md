*....and in those days of old, when the three alliances fought amongst each other to control Ald Cyrod, a black cloud fell over the town of Amol in Shor's Skyrim. A young Nordic girl appeared from inside the cloud and set out a thousand spiders which poisoned and ate the townspeople while they slept. For she was Geslarr the Eight-Spurrned; the Champion of Mephala the Web-Spinner and the Eight-Legged Daughter of legend.*

*She was the spawn of the Web-Spinner herself; it was only logical that she be under her command. When Mephala asked for a death, the deed was performed; even when the chosen one was the lover of Geslarr.*

*The people of Skyrim heard of her performances, and trembled with fear at the sound of her name. A cult was formed in the mountains who prayed to the Web-Spinner and asked for her child to go there and become their patron. Mephala looked upon the cult and hatched a plan. She sent Geslarr to the mountains to answer the cult's pleas,  where she remained for four years short of a dozen years, waiting patiently for Mephala's newest victim to be identified.*

*The cult grew restless with Geslarr, for they long awaited to join her on a hunt. They began to question Geslarr's claim that she was Mephala's Champion, and turned on the now young woman, leaving her corpse to freeze in the cold, dark, winter wind.*

*Mephala wept at the loss of her child and put her plan into action. When the cult prayed for Mephala to appear to them, she was only too happy to please them.*

*"Lady Mephala, the false Champion known as Geslarr was slain in your name. With no patron, we have no purpose. Give us your wisdom, so we may know which path to take."*

*"You fools! Geslarr was MY daughter!!! MY CHAMPION!!! You shall all die now for your treachery; not just once but eight times for each limb you froze of hers."*

*And with that Geslarr's frozen remains entered the mountain, along with a thousand spiders for each cultist and she slew them all eight times each like the villagers at Amol.*

*Mephala was proud of Geslarr and gave back her life and she was told to remain in the mountains to await a new task.*

*And if you travel to the hills east of Amol, you can still hear the cultists' screams echo throughout the mountains.*
