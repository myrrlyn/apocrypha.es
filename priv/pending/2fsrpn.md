The Story of Evermore, and an Account of the Worm King's Lichdom

By Seholium Triacci; chief Historian of Cheydinhal and the Niben - 4E 198

Evermore, is a beautiful city on the far banks of the Halcyon Lake, in the shadow of the great Druadach Mountains.  It lies vaguely on the edge of the Reach, having to deal with frequent raids from the Sehuac, Madruak and Salkhan tribes.  The nearby savannahs of Ephesus lie devoid of any settlements, other than small Breton, Orcish and Redguard hamlets, who supply the city with produce and income, thus, supporting the economy of Bangkorai.

Ever wondered what happened to Mannimarco?  The King of Worms?  Well, I, your humble writer, is about to explain these anomalies, and how it ties into Evermore's rich history.

Old Evermore used to lie south of Lake Halcyon, on the banks of the River Bjoulsae.  All that is now left of this once prosperous city is a collection of tumbledown forts, towers and rubble; home to bandits and brigands.

Sometime in the second era,  not long after the Planemeld, and the end of the Invasion from Molag Bal, Mannimarco had been resurrected from the ashes after being destroyed by the so-called 'Vestige,' and also Galerion, and not for the first time. Reborn by his cultists, he was weak, as he had not yet achieved Lichdom, and not only had no soul, but also a truly corrupted, rotting mind.  He sought to achieve Lichdom, however, and discovered an ancient ritual, never before used by mortals.  One of the trials to become one of the these 'Lichs,' was to supposedly 'repair' one's soul and mind, by destroying a vast multitude of innocent civilians.  Mannimarco, desperate to regain his life, and become strong again, ignored the illogicality of the situation.  Unbeknownst to the Worm King, these rituals would further corrupt his mind, body and soul, after he became a  Lich.

So, using his necromantic powers, he burnt Old Evermore to the ground, completing the rest of the vile rituals, thus achieving great strength, Lichdom and a corrupted soul, (some also argue he became a God.)

Not long afterward, he fought his final battle with Galerion, atop (and some say  around,) the great Mount Evermore, the shadow it casts still haunts Evermore today.  This battle proved to Galerion that Mannimarco was a Lich, and one of the most powerful Necromancers in the world.

The ruins of Old Evermore were almost forgotten by the time Tiber Septim rose to power.  Soon after the rise of the Septim Empire; Geraldis Herao; a powerful politician from Auridon, chose to rebuild it, by the fertile fields and forests on the North Banks of Lake Halcyon.  By the fourth era, Evermore had once again become a trading capital, famous for its vast blue spires, rich forests and military power.  Not for long, however, as the Thalmor threaten Bangkorai's borders...
