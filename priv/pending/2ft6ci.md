Unlike the other Imperial territories like Roscrea, Esrionet, and Cathnoquey, the islands that make up the 3rd Imperial Territory was brought into the Empire’s domain by treaty rather than force. This Treaty – known as The Truce in the East – was signed in 3E 279, a year after the discovery of Yneslea by scouting vessels.

The Twelvemonth War began when the Legion made landfall the Ambient Littoral region on Yne and encountered a community of Echmeri Exul on the surface. When the natives attempted to make contact, a patrol slaughtered them ruthlessly and the survivors fled belowground to the more sophisticated Urbs. The Council of Dull Chimes immediately mobilized the Penta Wards and declared war on the Empire. By then, however, many aboveground villages had already fallen to the surprised and now hostile legionnaires – the death toll including the elderly, women, and children. This drove the normally nonviolent Echmer into a frenzy, and they began to deploy their war automatons to attack the Empire.

At first, it seemed that the Echmer would win by their superior knowledge of the terrain and their massive war machines. However, the Empire soon discovered their fatal weakness: their misunderstanding and disregard for magicka as well as their zero amount of information on the Tamrielic races. Taking advantage of this, the Empire turned the tide against the natives and surprised them even further by breaking into the Dweech and taking control of their capital Urb, Oexra’numsaz. To avoid the destruction of their city or the deaths of their Troika (who sit on three of the seats in their Council), the Echmer proposed a suspension of hostilities to negotiate with the Empire.

Uriel Septim V himself traveled to the islands to sign the treaty and legend has it that the Echmer hero-god HRAHNDEYL manifested to speak with him (many scholars take this as evidence that Uriel V was much like his ancestor Tiber, who met with Lord Vivec of Morrowind for the legendary Armistice) about the terms of acquisition. It is not a secret that many of the Echmer were taken aback and enraged at one of their more beloved entities making peace talks with the enemy, which is why The Truce in the East is still generally hated by the Echmeri populace to this very day.

One of the main ideas of the Treaty was to allow Yneslea to have a large degree of self-governance while also making it a territory of the Empire under Uriel’s rule, resulting in the Emperor deciding to focus on both its economic and military power. First Uriel V took full control over Yneslea’s trading business, making it a major base of operations for the East Empire Company. He also placed a massive garrison – Fort Musicmoth – on the islands, as well as restricting the mobilizing of the Echmeri army and the production of their war automatons.

In return the Council of Dull Chimes maintained its status as the primarily authority of the Yneslian islands, with the ancient Penta Wards and the Troika staying in power. The Dweech itself became all but inaccessible to the Empire, with only Oexra’numsaz being open to Tamrielic visitors. No Imperial monarch was proclaimed for the islands, although representatives of the Empire were sent to live in the aforementioned Urb. An Echmer Consul became the 25th seat of the Elder Council and an embassy was established in Cyrodiil. The religious practices of the Echmer were realized as a faith in the Empire and were not to be encroached on; finally, Echmer researches were to remain outside of Imperial control.

The Penta Wards all had mixed reactions, but nevertheless agreed to the Treaty. The Coalescent Efflux went along coolly, probably not interested at all in the proceedings. The Shattering Fusion was at first hostile, being the bulk of the army, but submitted when it saw the normally distant and cold Neglectful Acceptance sign without question. The Hidden Perception followed HRAHNDEYL’s lead, and the Confined Abyss finally signed the Treaty after the Emperor swore that the Imperial Battlemages would apologize for their embarrassment.

The Treaty led to the islands Yne and Slea (along with the massive underground cavern system known as the Dweech, although it was entirely self-governed) being recognized as separate Imperial administrative districts. These islands would remain largely untouched by the Empire until the year 425, when they were opened up to colonization. Eight years later the three small islands to the north known as Hrahn’s Isles were also opened for settlement.
