**The Birth of Hunger and the Orgy that inspired Death.**

In the Darkened days of the beginning days, when All were shades of Black and White, and the Eagle of Time issued forth to see the Mother of Night and they comprised the New Era, The Grey Existence, Time bade Grey to issue forth.And Space saw the Ideas and gave them position, but they refused to merely exist in one place. The Waves of their fickle existence orbited the Waves of their Truest Name, and so the Planes formed. but the possibility of their Existence Waves were edgeless, and the Valence Shells of their Existence were no longer bound to their truest names, and they were taken and traded and stolen, and the Edgeless Planes twisted and formed the Molecule of the Aurbus, and it was called the Wheel, and there was two Laws among them, Hunger and fulfillment, pull and push, balance. And among the Planes was a Idea that twisted throughout, and that Idea was Hunger, and it hid in the shroud of Night, for Oblivion is the safety of Ambition from the Now Dead Laws. Space drifted into the Darkest Darkness, the Void, and looked upon the Grey Place, and He did not behold the seat of Time, and the Shroud of Night, but rather he saw the Molecule of All Existence, and was saddened for he could not see himself in the orgy, though he was there. So Space went to the Grey, and spoke of what he saw, and in the cacophony of connection he knew not who said what, nor what even he thought. Hunger sent a spark of Existence to space, who uptook it, and made it his own, and Space grew Hungry. and Space longed for the Connection of all existence, for he did not see his I, so he did not behold All, and he could not say We, the All and the I. And Space in his hunger went to the seat of Time, and the Serpent ate, and he consumed the Coldest Ones, and hid them in his Bones, and he defecated the Nuclei of the Truest Names into Oblivion, and they lingered, floating there as Planets. And Space came to the Scribe, and The Serpent began to eat, and the Serpent ate the tongue of the Scribe, and bound the contents of his stomach to it, and he ate the eyes of the Scribe, but the Serpent grew to fat, and he fell into the sea of Night, and the Serpent was sundered in twain by the amount he had eaten, and his Truest Name was split and floated above his vomit, and his heart, and the tongue, and the Laws of the Cold Ones fell into the Singularity of his Hunger, and Space was dead, and his Soul lingered over this New Planet, and it still hungered for the completion of the Orgy that is All, and I and We.

**Hunger The Killer of Kings**

In the days of the Era Zero, when Mortals first walked, The Dead Ones pressed upon the New Planet, and there Laws were made truth, and the Mortals did as they were told, and the Mortals built New Laws to crown their civilizations. And in those civilizations luck gave some more than others, and the towers of those civilizations became stratified, and there were rich and poor. And Hunger went to the rich and made them forget necessity, and they ate from the hands of the poor, and the rich grew fat, and they would gnaw upon the bones of all that was below them, and they would grow so fat that their skin began to rip, and tear and they were sundered, at their heart, or at their stomach, and they would keel over, blue, or they would stumble and the contents of their bellies would continue, and they would pop, and their organs would spill forth, and their chyme would issue forth and spread at their impact. And others drank the spoils of fruit, and they grew different from their wine, and they drank up vineyards worth of wine, and they lost themselves, and they grew blind, and they perished from as their insides became like the hide of scared combatants.

And Hunger would visit the handsome, and bade them to share their lust, and they fucked until they were raw, and until they ran out of willing lovers, and they went to those that would be bought, and they owned their bodies, and they fucked those whores until they ran out of money, and then they would turn to those that were beneath them, the poor and the captured. but Lust grew bored of all the fucking, and he went to the young Mortals, and gave them the gifts of obsession, and some grew hungry of feet, and some grew hungry to lash those around them, and some grew hungry of pain, and they would be whipped until their bones showed through, and then they would have their bones chewed on, until the chewers teeth crumbled, and some grew hungry for their mothers and fathers, and for the children, and for blood. And Hunger delighted in the kinks, and the orgiastic pain. And Hunger blessed others with great features and feats. And some women were given great members, and some were taught to produce magics from seed and moans, and some were taught to pleasure with the swimming trouts, and others could produce rivers where most men make drops.

And Ambition visited the poor, and bade them to set their sights high, and Hunger laughed as the poor were stolen from in the name of Law, that the rich might grow fat, and Ambition grew to completion as the rich were distracted with their whores and wine, and did not notice the anger of the peasants and proletariat, and the workers overthrew the fat kings, only to turn to the same whores and bottles. And they became what they hated. 

And Hunger drowns nations in semen, and hunger turns spouse on spouse, and all Mortals cower at the shadow of Hunger.

*He is Hunger, He is Lust, He is Ambition, He is Sanguine, Fear Him, appease Him.*
