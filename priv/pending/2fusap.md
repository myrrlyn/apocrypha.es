*A goblin's letter to his Orc friend, on how to consecrate a place in the name of Muluk for religious ceremony.*
***
I cannot believe how many times I have to re-scrawl or completely re-do this scrap! This modern Cyrodiilic is not like its mother— *that* at least I could kind of understand. My past papers are full of holes and big black scritch marks. Hopefully this one will be cleaner. Anyway Gurok, here’s the damned letter you want. I don’t see why you cannot visit me, it would be a much needed ~~repreev~~ reprieve from practicing my writing. Whatever. I’ve listed all the things you’ll need to do for the ritual. I still don’t think our shaman would approve but:

Pick your spot. It can be small but whatever. Where you wanna do it— dump the fire salts on the ground. Make sure they spread even or you’ll burn a hole in the ground (that’s bad you dolt). Empty the wood beer on it and let it smolder and smoke (don’t breath that in). When the smoke clears, smash the skull I told you to get— do that inside the fire salt. The words that finish the thing are “*Muluk ny’ulz arloi*.” Say that right, idiot. I can’t be there to help so you have to do it by yourself. I drew a picture of you being stab in the gut by Muluk Himself to make you get the point. Tell me how it goes but next time you visit me in stead. I’m not writing any more the paper is gonna rip.
