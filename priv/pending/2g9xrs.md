Smoking Traditions of Tamriel: Skyrim

Long referred to as The Crucible of Man, the ancient north has given rise to a bevy of smoking styles so diverse and fascinating as to rival the Cyrod itself. Many cultures have commingled in Skyrim over the ages, giving rise to a grand variety of traditions, each adopted from other cultures, but refined into something uniquely Nordic.

From east to west, the pipe rules supreme as the preferred way for Nords to enjoy their tobacco, yet styles range far and wide. For many a Nord, the smell of pipe-smoke invokes fond memories of sitting around the family firepit, listening to the tales of their fathers and grandfathers.

In the Northeast, throughout Hafingaar and the Pale, long, narrow pipes with cherry stems and bowls of Meerschaum or Briarwood are popular. These pipes originated in the Breton regimental style, but tend to be much less ornate in style, additionally, the stems tend to extend from the bowl at a shallower angle than the Breton pipes, lending them a longer appearance. Cigars, especially small cigarellos, enjoy some popularity among sailors and dockworkers, who often cannot afford the risk of dropping an expensive pipe into the freezing seas.

In the region ranging from Falkreath hold and extending well into the Rift and all the way up into Windhelm, Massive freehand-carved briar pipes reign supreme. These are typically carved into wild, flowing forms that use the natural shape of the briarwood to their advantage. These pipes are much sought-after by collectors outside of Skyrim, and enjoy a particular popularity in Colovia. Although most towns play home to many carvers who produce these styles of pipes, none can rival the work of the Whiterun Pipemaker’s Guild, an organization that claims to trace its own provenance back to the days of Ysgramor*. Whiterun Freehand pipes are expensive, rare, and masterful in their execution, and are held in great regard as a mark of class and distinction the world over. I have even met nobles in the Summerset who proudly keep these works of art in their collections.

*(Author’s note: Atmora seems an unlikely locale to support a tobacco trade, and the smoking of tobacco was introduced to men by the Ayleid and Velothi in the first era, so the claims of Ysgramor having having a pipemaker in his retinue are exceedingly unlikely, and this is likely a marketing myth to play on the Nordic sense of national pride.)

No tobacco is grown in Skyrim, the climate throughout the province being far too cold, even in the warmest regions, to support proper cultivation. The Nords import all of their tobacco from Morrowind, High Rock, Argonia, and most of all from the Cyrod, with the East Empire company alone supplying 67% of the imported tobacco. Nords prefer sweet, aromatic strains that warm the chest in the cool northern nights. 

Dunmeri influence can be felt in the east, particularly in the Rift, and less so near Windhelm. Dunmeri waterpipes, or Nargile, have become something of a popular item around Riften. I met with Llaro Bero, a Dumer trader representing House Hlaalu, who set up with an innkeep in the city, offering Nargile to the patrons as an after-meal digestive aid. Although the cost of importing Jurak is somewhat high, his profits were nonetheless substantial, and the inn has become something a popular destination for Nords looking for a little exotic flair. 

Another Dunmeri import, Khlou, a mixture of Argonian Blackleaf Tobacco and Hackle-lo leaf, soaked in pomegranate juice and pressure-fermented, makes a popular pipe blend throughout the east. This smoke is known for it’s mild, sweet, playful flavor and energy-giving qualities, making all the rage among young workers throughout the Rift and beyond.

Poskjaar is a typically tobacco-free blend of powerful psychotropic herbs and stimulant treebark, mixed with Juniper berries. This potent drug is sold on the black market throughout the reach, and often traded with Khajiiti caravans bold enough to face the dire consequences of the law if caught trafficking in it. A creation of the witches among the Reachmen, Poskjaar has a potent mind-altering effect on the smoker, bringing on powerful hallucinations, a surge of energy, and a feeling of Euphoria. The drug also possess strong pain-killing properties. Originally made for and used by raiders and warriors among the reachmen, militant tribes such as the foresworn have found that the sale of the illicit substance to outsiders has provided an impressive source of monetary income. In retaliation, the allthing has issued a ban on the substance resulting in harsh penalties, including lashing, jail time, and in Markarth, death by beheading. These harsh measures have done little to curtail the flow of this dangerous substance out of the Reach.
