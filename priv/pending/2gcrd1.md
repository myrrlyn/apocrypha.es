"What do you think is the biggest challenge facing Orsimer now that you've established a Kingdom?"

"I suppose it would be re-uniting the tribes.  I know we may seem united but it's been an uphill battle.  Each clan has their own Chief and each Chief has his own idea of what's right."

"Why's that?"

"Our society is based on might makes right.  Sometimes this is good, as a strong leader makes for a strong tribe.  But this is a land ruled by weaker MenMer* who resolve disputes with backroom deals and diplomatic talks, not a warhammer to the mouth as the Chiefs have grown used to.  You need an Orsimer who can think like MenMer."

"What's your biggest fear?"

"That I will become hated by my own people.  Every deal I make, every war I end peacefully furthers the long term future of Orsinium but drags my reputation with the Chiefs through the mud."

"Do you resent the Chiefs for this?"

"Of course not.  They do not know any better.  I just wish they could see how I could see, how the common Orc of Orsinium sees the situation.  The common Orc may be full of bravado and ready to fight but deep down we all wish for a peaceful, happy life like all Menmer."

*MenMer is the closest translation I could get.  In the original Orcish, it's Grah-Ohm, which literally translated means "comes from others".
