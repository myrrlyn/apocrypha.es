"So you sell...?"

"Skooma, right.  What's the matter?  Can't say it?"

"No, it's just that..."

"What?  It's distasteful?  It's disgusting?  It's immoral?  Let me tell you something, nothing in this life is immoral if you don't treat it as such.  The most successful people in Tamriel are those who ignore morals and just do what they want.  Look at Tiber Septim for example, he killed thousands in his wars of conquest and he got to become a GOD.  Now you tell me, if I killed thousands and become Nordinor the Mighty would you bow down and kiss my boots?  You better believe you won't unless I dress it up real nice and pretend it's for the greater good."

"You seem really defensive.  Do people often preach to you about what you're doing?"

"Fetch* yes I'm angry.  Who wouldn't be?  I came here with nothing, just like everyone else and I'm the only guy out of hundreds of degenerates to make something of myself.  Tell you what, next time you see a relative of mine in Valenwood squatting in the mud eating an arm, you tell him what an evil guy Nordinor is because he lets people get high."

Note: We stood in silence for a few seconds.  Nordinor then speaks again.

"Buy something or get the fetch out"

*Sorry about the language.
