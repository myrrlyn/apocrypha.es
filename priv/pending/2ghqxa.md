A Review of Armfion the Perfect Room's *Mnemolic Particle Oscillation* (3E401)

^by ^Remalius ^Penitus, ^3rd ^Examiner ^and ^Bearer ^of ^Golden ^Pincers.

**Forward**

My most recent and wildly successful book *An Examination of the Wheel* (3E421) prompted a long tour during which I performed selected readings and conducted question and answer sessions with the literate general.  Without exaggeration, most of the questions I received were in respect to my esteemed Altmer colleague Armfion the Perfect Room and his seminal (and only) book on the subject of mnemolic particles and their contradictory behaviors.  As one of the few scholars in the field of magicks who actually understands the sum of this obtuse and lengthy tome I naturally welcome inquiries into its mysteries, but I found the volume of individuals seeking illumination to be staggering.  So with pen in hand I will now attempt to explain, in much easier terms, the significance of Armfion's findings.

But first, a word about the author.  Armfion the Perfect Room, Ordinal-Singer 11th Class, 3rd Zenzizenzizenzic, has spent his entire career in Theoretical Magicks studying the Atomos and its behaviors.   Attending to such miniscule and imperceptible concept-structures came easily to a Mer of Armfion's disposition.  Some call him meticulous and strong willed, others call him infuriatingly detail-obsessed.  Either way, his personality is easily perceived in *Mnemolic Particle Oscillation*; it is a tome of indomitable length and complexity.  But within its sesquipedalian sentences is a critically primal theory for the fundamental operations of the Aurbis.

A quick note: those who wish to obtain a copy of *Mnemolic Particle Oscillation* for themselves would be well advised to purchase the 2,167-page version from Shimmering Poetry Publications in the Summerset Isles.  The annotated version published by Miracle Holdings LLC is a more portable version, having lost twelve pounds by shedding roughly 300 pages.  The 900 page "condensed reader's version" published by Oracle Limited is an abomination and must be destroyed.  Now on to the review.


**Introduction**

*Mnemolic Particle Oscillation* attempts to explain a very common question that is frequently raised during the study of pure magicka: "What exactly is magicka?"  Since pure magicka cannot be directly observed by any of the six-minus-one senses, it is easiest to explain it as similar to sunlight or moonlight.  This is a useful analog, as magicka enters our dimension through the sun and the stars, which are actually holes in Oblivion.  Think of them as tiny windows into Aetherius, a realm of infinite and unfathomable magical energy.  Sunlight, like Magicka, is only detectable by observing that which sunlight changes: stand beneath a sunbeam and your skin becomes warm and illuminated.  But the light *itself* is invisible.

In order to study the undetectable, magicians have devised a wide and diverse array of devices and spells, each allowing new and amazing insight into magical function.  Most famously, the discovery of chronocules and terrestrons allowed magicians to closely alter the behavior of magicka.  Many modern conveniences that we take for granted would have been impossible without the discovery of these two particles, and the constant battle between them.

But it was Armfion's ground-breaking research in Mnemolic Particle Oscillation that revealed that the way chronocules and terrestrons interact can determine the entire length and breadth of magical behavior.  Let's start with the very basics of magical particle structure and phenomenon.
