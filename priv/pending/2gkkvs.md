My original post can be found below, along with a link to DC thread. Another user, DDMN, was kind enough to 'Ta'Agrify' this for me. The basic concept - what would happen if the Khajiit had their own version of Aesop?

Dro'Jizad's Fables


A middle-aged Khajiit took two mistresses, one older than him, and one younger. The older mistress, ashamed to be sleeping with a Cat so much younger than her, took to plucking every dark hair from his mane. The younger mistress, ashamed to be sleeping with a Cat so much older than her, took to plucking every light hair from his mane. And so it was, that the silly Khajiit ended up with no mane at all.

That which is ill-matched will always run into difficulties.


A Khajiit and an Altmer were sailing, when they were caught in a storm. As their boat sank below the waves, the Altmer thrashed about and cried out to Auriel to save him. He continued to pray to the Gods even as his head sank below the waves. The clever Khajiit used his arms to swim to the shore instead.

Praying to the Gods is fine, but don’t forget to help yourself, as well.


A Nord was making his way through a mountain pass, when he saw what looked to be an apple on the ground. Deciding to crush it, he brought his boot down. But to his surprise, the apple doubled in size. He brought down his boot more violently than before, then his mighty hammer, but the apple continued to grow, until it swelled to cover the entire mountain pass. The Nord dropped his hammer in amazement. A passing Khajiit told him:
“Stop, fool! For this thing is the spirit of quarrels and spite. If one leaves it alone, and walks around it, it stays as it was before. But if one strikes it, see how it swells!”

Sometimes it is better to be quiet and clever than to be violent.



A Khajiit had a wooden statue of a foreign god in his home, and made many offerings to it in return for wealth. But only his misery increased to show for it, as he lost his riches. In anger, he seized the statue by the foot, and smashed it upon a wall. The head of the god broke open, and poured forth a hoard of gold.
“What a strange god! For when I honoured you, you brought me nothing but ruin, but when I smash you to pieces, you shower me with wealth!”

Striking a useless person may occasionally be more productive than bribing him.


There was once a Bosmer who held a grudge against a young Khajiit, for he had caused the Elf some trouble. When the Elf finally caught the little Alfiq, he tied a burning rope to the Cats’ tail.
“That’ll teach you!” He cried.
But the Alfiq ran to the Bosmers’ Forest, and set fire to all of his trees.

Extravagant acts of revenge are for fools. A swift one is far better.


One day, a messenger of Riddle’thar was sent to spread a caravan filled with lies, villainy and fraud equally across Nirni. But, over the great forests of the Bosmer the caravan broke down, and the Elves stole all that was left in the caravan, thinking it precious. And so, more than anyone, the Boiche are liars and cheats.

Never trust a Bosmer.


A merchant, his son, and their therium were taking goods to Valenwood. The elder Khajiit rode on the back of their beast, and his son walked, and they proceeded like this for some time. A snooty Wood Elf saw them, and told the trader:
“Why do you ride on the back of your beast, while your poor young son is made to walk? Have you no compassion for the child?”
So, a little surprised, the father considered the opinion. He swapped places with his son, and they continued onward for some time like this. Eventually, they passed another snooty Wood Elf, who told the son:
“Why do you ride on the back of your beast, while your poor elderly father is made to walk? Have you no respect for your parent?”
So, rather annoyed, they considered the opinion, and they both rode on the back of their therium. Eventually, they came across another Wood Elf, who told the pair:
“Why do you both ride on the back of the poor animal, when it can can barely support your weight? Have you no sympathy for the creature?”
So, quite angry now, they grudgingly followed the opinion, and neither of them rode the therium, instead walking beside it. Eventually, they stumbled upon another stupid Wood Elf, who told the pair:
“Why do you both walk beside the creature, when it is perfectly capable of carrying one of you? Are you both dull?”
So, furious, they killed the stupid Wood Elf and buried his body in the forest, where no one would find it.


Never tell Khajiit what to do!
