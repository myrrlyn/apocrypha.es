Credit where it's due, this was very heavily inspired by /u/julian_baubauhaus and his thread [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/25s22j/why_did_general_tullius_order_the_execution_are/). In Beyond Skyrim, this report will be found on the body of a dead courier. It grew out of a desire of mine to see the factions of the Civil War better fleshed out, as well as give the player a reason not to butcher every Legionnaire they see in Cyrodiil for trying to execute them.


FOR THE INWARD SEEING EYE ONLY
SKYRIM REPORT - INSPECTOR ‘CLAUDIUS’, 16^th LAST SEED, 4E201

Hail,

I hope this report receives you in good health. By the Divines, you’re going to be feeling good when you’ve finished reading it.

As I’m sure you’re aware, I was assigned to the Skyrim task as a personal attaché of General Tullius, and to monitor the increasingly warm Cold War between the Empire and the Domnion. And it is getting... well, *warm*, especially since Ambassador Elenwen’s own reassignment to the North after the Markarth Incident.

I’m going to assume you’re familiar with the official version of the Civil War in Skyrim – I understand *‘The Mudcrab’* can’t get enough of it – but events up here have finally taken a positive turn. General Tullius has (just an hour before this documents was drafted) captured the Bear of the North himself! Ulfric Stormcloak and a cadre of supporters were trying to sway the Orphan Rock clan of witches in Falkreath into treason against the Empire, when they were tempted by a bait force of legionnaires. To their great credit the men were able to draw the Stormcloaks close enough to the border with Cyrodiil to allow a much larger force to incapacitate the traitor and his men. They are now being escorted under heavy guard to Helgen, an Imperial stronghold in the area.

My own investigations into the character of Ulfic Stormcloak himself have turned up some very interesting tidbits. We’d been aware for a long time of his status as a potential asset of the Thalmor, but if he ever operated in their interests, one thing is clear; the Thalmor had *utterly* lost control of him. This uprising beyond mere agitation and distraction from the Empire's southern borders, and into the realms of true, full scale secession. Elf soldiers and agents rarely make it out of Stormcloak held territory in anything approaching one piece, and as far as I can tell the leadership of the natives had refuted all direct communication with the Thalmor or their embassy. This is not to say they aren’t receiving any outside support; I’ve provided an attached list of fourteen companies and organisations I suspect of providing arms, armor or funds to the Stormcloaks, many of which are registered under Altmer (and Imperial) names. But Ulfric appears to have purged himself and his organisation of overt Elvish influences some time ago – whatever he was fighting for in the end, he bloody meant it.

It appears inevitable that Elenwen will try some last minute, desperate attempt to keep Ulfric alive and this war going; as of writing, she has unsuccessfully attempted to take command of the prisoner detail herself, and has demanded to speak to Tullius again upon their arrival at Helgen. Of course, after passing into Thalmor hands, the Stormcloaks will make a ‘miraculous’ escape attempt, and the war will rage on. Tullius, for his part, has treated any threats (diplomatic or otherwise) with all the contempt they deserve. Two seemingly unaffiliated individuals were caught in the ambush and interred with the rebels, a horse thief and a traveller from over the border. They are being treated as potential inside agents or jailbreakers – after all, their timing seems a little too convenient for anyone’s tastes, and this time the General is determined not to take any chances.

Which brings us to our last point – the summary execution of Ulfric Stormcloak, his supporters, and any suspected enemy agents upon their escort to Helgen. No trials, no protests, no escape.

Short, yes, brutal, absolutely, illegal, quite possibly. But frankly, I – we – just want this damn war over. The men of the IV Legion want to go home. And every minute Ulfric stays alive, not only prolongs the bloodshed, it strengthens the Thalmor. It makes it more likely Elenwen, the horse thief, or the traveller will enact an escape plan. It means more dead men, women and children. It’s in everyone’s best interests that every prisoner captured meets their end at Helgen to avoid a long, protracted war. I am willing to personally vouch for Tullius if you feel this is beyond his remit to end the uprising.

I will be sending this message with a messenger of the General, while I accompany him to Helgen to see the end of all this. You’ll find the Bear of the North’s head following a few days later, with my full report. I look forward to my debriefing back home.

Long live the Emperor!

Agent ‘Claudius’
