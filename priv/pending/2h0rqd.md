...that the Song of the Past and Future is the Song of Light. Do they not see the Dawn in the East every morning? Do they not see the origin of their Light? The Eastern Star bathes them in its Magnificent splendor and washes past, over us all, away into the West, always back into the Western Eye, carried far by the Blue-Tailed Hawk until it is nothing more than distant memory, archived in its finality upon a Scroll *(if Scroll == 1)*, around just long enough for centrites to forget, beyond memory, recycled into new Void for Dawn to fill. What aspect of the trigoparabolic song eludes them?

Is it the fact the motion can't be stopped that prevents them from ever feeling it at all?

True Dawn is not triggered, nor is is bought, nor is it wrought.

True Dawn is carried by an Eagle and guarded by a Dragon.

Darkness follows in its proper time.
