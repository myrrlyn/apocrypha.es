A blind man met me in my study one afternoon, and handed me this book. A skull with two serpents entwined around it adorned the cover. I did not know what I had laid my hands across, but I assure you, they are the most sinister of omens.

-----------------------------------------------------------

The Omens Vol. 1;
--------------

You: that wear the scar of the deceived,

Those that are poisoned by their creed -

You must cut out the faith
 
To cure your sickness.



Down on your knees,

Prove to me you'll die for your belief.

And once your morality has been freed

You shall be clean.




Prepare for the collapse of your dream

For your corpses will build my effigy



And in the end, when your lives dry to ashes

And every trace of you has been obliterated

This world will be made my own.



Don't beg and plead, this is what you want,

This is what you asked for

This is the prophecy

And I have come to see it through
