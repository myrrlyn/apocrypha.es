*While in the city of Dawnstar, I heard rumours that a group of hunters had captured a white goblin. It was in my interests to seek out this goblin. After paying the hunters a healthy fee, I was granted an audience. Below is one of many collections of words I had with the strange goblin. I have attempted to transcribe the broken Ayleidoon it spoke into coherent sentences for you, the reader.*

The Elders do not speak a lot. But when they do, it is mostly of half-remembered memories.

The Elders once spoke of a time when our people worshipped what they call the brightest of lights, and we named the light Orielle.

The light looked over our people and filled our hearts with his warm embrace. Our people were the greatest in all the land.

And then everything changed.

One of our people cried out in pain when she could not feel Orielle's embrace. One person became two people, and two people became three. Soon, all of our people had been forgotten by Orielle. 

We were scared. What had we done to offend Orielle? Would this darkness last forever? We had many more questions that could not be answered by anyone.

And then she spoke.

But only when we were asleep.

So we slept for a long time.

She said she could help us.

She said we would be safe if we worshipped her.

She asked for a temple, so we built one in the north.

And she was pleased.

When we slept, she asked us to kill.

And we did.

So much blood.

And she was pleased, so pleased.

And the dead rose, so we had to kill again.

Books appeared upon their corpses when they died, and we were scared.

We presented them to the elements, and when we left them, they stayed still.

We asked her to ask Orielle to forgive our sins.

She said she did, and he will think about it.

We await for Orielle to return to us and make us happy again.

Until that day, we worship her and we have embraced her darkness.

And she is pleased.

**Her name is Xrib.**
