   *Hello soldier. You have chosen the most honorable path in life by choosing to fight for your glorious Empire. You will face many foes that wish the smite the Imperial Empire from Tamriel, although thanks to you and your comrades brave actions, they will fail. There have always been factions vying for the throne of Cyrodiil - racial tensions pushed aside to strive for the prize of the White Gold Tower. With your sword, shield, and blood these foes will be halted in their murderous tracks. With this field guide you will learn how to combat every race from every province. You will learn their tendencies, their weaponry, their tactics, their weaknesses, but more importantly, their strengths.*

   *You must be prepared for a threat from anywhere in Tamriel, even from your own Imperial kinsmen. This will be no small task for you to learn, so keep these writings near you at all times and learn from them often. It is through men and women like you that the Empire remains intact.*  

   *The guide will be broken up into 13 sections. One for every major race on Tamriel, as well as Ashlanders, Reachman, and Daedra. Take the knowledge inside and call upon it more often than you do your sword in battle. Do this and victory will surely be yours.*
