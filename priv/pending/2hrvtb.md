*Author's note - This interview was conducted in the White Goblin Inn of Whiterun during the reign of the Akaviri Potentate in the Second Era. The subject is one Villads Grey-Mane, of Clan Grey-Mane. The authorship is unknown, but this appears to be the first in a series of similar interviews all apparently conducted by a single Colovian male.* 

**I want to thank you kindly for your hospitality and your time. This Whiterun Ale is delightful. For my readers back home in Anvil County, would you briefly introduce yourself?** 

"Aye. I am Villads Grey-Mane. I'm a blacksmith." 

**Sir, that is a wonderfully adroit introduction, but don't you think you sell yourself a bit short? You are a legendary master-craftsman of Clan Grey-Mane. Your steel is world famous.** 

*At this point my host merely shrugs and takes a sip of Whiterun Ale* 

**I can tell your humility is genuine, sir, so I shan't shower you with praise. First off, tell us a little bit about your family history.** 

"The Grey-Manes? We came over on that ship up on the hill, near Dragonsreach. The Jorrvaskr. Me ancestors fought alongside Jeek of the River and founded Whiterun Hold. The Grey-Manes were craftsmen back in Atmora and we're still Craftsmen here. I don't obsess over that stuff meself, laddie. I'm just a simple maker of arms and armor."

**The Jorrvaskr and the Companions are world famous. What does it mean to you to be a Companion?** 

"Look, fella. That's an annoying assumption to make, yer ken? I ain't actually a Companion myself. I just make their stuff 'n keep it in good shape. Pretty much always been a Grey-Mane workin' fer the Companions. It's a tradition. Passed down to me from my 'da, and from his 'da to him on back to the beginning."

**Let's talk about that beginning you mentioned. I read a Brief History of Whiterun Hold, and it mentions local oral traditions on the Skyforge. Is it true that the Forge was already here when the Nords arrived?**

"That's not business fer outsiders like yer, laddie. No offense. I find yer tolerable for a Heartlander." 

*At this point in the interview, I pulled back part of my cloak to reveal my Amulet of Kyne. His eyes widened a bit, and he nodded.* 

"Colovian, then. Aye. Some of yer still keep to the old Gods. The proper Gods. I can tell yer a little bit about me beliefs, then. Sure. Yeah, we didn't build the Forge. Truth is the Daughters of Kyne built it, back before Man nor Elf sat foot in this part 'o the world. They've always looked out fer us, you know. The old Gods. A lot 'o yer Heartlanders worship money or damned bulls or some nonsense but not us. We know our Gods are real and they look out fer us. Kyne most of all. She breathed life into our forms. She gave us the Voice to crush our enemies, and yeah, she had the beautiful Forge made in her image, and infused with her Divine blood." 

**So is it the blessing of Kyne that infuses your Skyforge Steel with such particularly fine qualities?** 

"Eh...not me Forge, laddie. It belongs to the Mother o' Storms. I just keep the fires lit for 'er while we await the Final Battle, yer ken? But yeah. It's 'er blessin' that infuses me steel arms and armor with such power. That an' a thousand years o' Smithin' tradition passed down through me family. I can't take credit for either. I'm just a humble servant of the people o' Skyrim." 

**Your loyalties are to Skyrim, then? To the High King?** 

"My loyalties are to me family first, the Hold second, the Jarl third, Mother Skyrim fourth, and yer Imperials least of all. I reckon the taxes ain't that bad lately, though."

**You didn't mention Smithing as a passion of yours, there.**

"Smithin' is what I do, laddie. It's all I know. It's not so much that I love it as I don't have a choice. I'm the eldest male of Clan Grey-Mane, and by long tradition we man the Skyforge. That's about it." 

**What of the rumors of civil unrest, and resentment of the Akaviri Potentate's policies? Does this increase business at the Skyforge?** 

"By all the Gods if that ain't a cynical an' insultin' question. Look. I find yer tolerable, and it's clear yer an outsider and yer ways ain't ours, so I won't run yer through, but listen. I'm only gonna say this once, laddie. I'm not runnin' a damned business. I make steel for the Companions. I do it to support me family, and the people who serve Skyrim. They fight fer honor and glory, and the protection of our people. They ain't mercenaries. You'll wanna go to that den o' thieves called Riften an' look up the Fighters Guild if yer wanna find a bunch o' thugs who fight an' kill for money."

**What's the importance of the Sword in Nordic culture?** 

"Well that was an abrupt change of tone. The Sword, eh? Short sword? Long sword? Greatsword?"

**Long sword.**

"Ah. Thought so. Weapon o' Kings, that. Shor's weapon, matter o' fact. Did yer know that? 'Course not. They don't teach that in yer fancy universities. Truth is, with the 'ception of the longsword, a weapon's a weapon, boy. They all cut an' kill an' smash an' maim. Longsword's a bit more than that. It's an Ancestor."

**An Ancestor you say?**

"Sure, sure. Didn't yer know? Steel is made by mixin' Iron with another compound. Carbon, yer educated types call it. Lotta people use Coal er somethin' like that. Here in Skyrim, when we make a Longsword, we always use the bones of an Ancestor in 'em.  My sword has my 'da's shin bone in it. Did yer know that? Well yer do now. Back in the old, old days the mightiest Kings and Thanes used Dragon bones in the process. The Dragons were our strongest, mightiest Ancestors. That's the honest truth. Betcher didn't know that either. But listen to me. I'm an old man who had too much to drink. Are we about done here yet?" 

**Sure. One more question, if you don't mind. What's your best tip for someone who wants to be a Master Smith, like you?** 

"Heh. Don't. If yer gotta be a smith, just be the best yer can. Don't copy an old fool like me. Don't think yer steel's ever gonna match what Mother Kyne gifts me with, either. It can't and it don't have to, laddie. Yer can kill some poor fool with the cheapest iron or bronze long sword if yer sever the right artery. Best sword in the world ain't much in the hands of a piss-poor swordsman. Maybe yer should interview a swordsman next?" 

**I plan on it, actually. I thank you for your time, good sir.** 

"Aye. I wish I could say the same. Now if yer excuse me, I have some hard drinkin' to attend to."
