To be delivered formally and sealed to Archmage Hannibal Traven of the Arcane University

Normally I stay within the bounds of historical fiction/nonfiction along with my usual bland work at the Imperial Geographical Society; but you surprisingly convinced me to aid you in this ‘special endeavor’ of yours, Archmage. The esoteric Magne-Ge are only mentioned in passing in some of the more ancient texts (which sounds quite odd, coming from my mouth), but I was able to acquire an invaluable text that aided in my interpretations (I even made you a copy). My mind grows weary on this subject however, and the Emperor himself calls me for an assignment that requires me to abandon this one. So here are my final notes on the Magne-Ge, which I will send to you one at a time. You just concentrate on having my emolument ready.

####THE STAR CHILDREN, THE ONES THAT RAN AWAY
I will start with an excerpt from The Heart of the World section of *The Monomyth*, which is one of the few tomes to slightly reference the Ge:

&gt;"But this was a trick. As Lorkhan knew, this world contained more limitations than not and was therefore hardly a thing of Anu at all. Mundus was the House of Sithis. As their aspects began to die off, many of the et'Ada vanished completely. Some escaped, like Magnus, and that is why there are no limitations to magic[…]

To the more knowledgeable scholars, the Magne-Ge (or Magne/Magna Ge) – which means Star Orphans – are the et’ada that fled from Mundus during the Dawn Era alongside Magnus, the God of Sorcery. When Lorkhan requested the aid of Magnus for the creation of the mortal realm, the latter became the Architect of Mundus. In certain ancient myths, the Magne-Ge are considered to be the spirits that helped formed the framework of Nirn under the Architect’s guidance.

When Magnus created the sun (which also bears his name, or is simply known as the ‘Eye of Magnus’) by tearing through Oblivion and back into Aetherius, the Magne-Ge created the stars by doing the same. Through the sun and stars magicka flows, which is described in *The Magic of Aetherius* section of the third edition of the *Pocket Guide to the Empire and its Environs* (I can’t believe I’m quoting a piece from the Society, specifically one I helped write…):

&gt;Aetherius, ancestral seat of the Nine Divines and the other original spirits, is the plane of pure magicka. Whereas Oblivion may surround us every night, it is aetherial energy that infuses our daily existence, from highest to lowest, and gives all the races of men, mer, and beast common purpose[…]

Because of this, the Ge (which is the plural form, Archmage. Get is the singular form, like I informed you the first time we met) are always associated with the stars, with a better word being synonymous. The Thirteen Birthsigns (except for the Serpent, which is made up of ‘un-stars’) are all unique because they derive their power from the Ge, who influence the stars.

Before we get into the main body of this essay, I shall first list all of the small mentions of individual Get throughout the eras. The first I will mention is from the *Exegesis of Merid-Nunda*, which introduces three of the star orphans to the written record. This book itself uses the Ayleid text known as the *Tract of Merid-Nunda* as its source, and the passage I quote from the exegesis has not been altered from said tract. I had to undergo new rites to have my ban at the Imperial Library lifted (I’m surprised that they actually remembered that bit of book espionage) to even gain access to said book. It read as follows:

&gt;"… were known as the Nine Coruscations, who followed the parabolas that led away from Magnus. Merid-Nunda was of these Sisters, as was Mnemo-Li, as was Xero-Lyg, as was …."

Exegesis names three out of the Nine Coruscations (glitters): Merid-Nunda (note the phonetic similarities to the Daedric Prince Meridia), Mnemo-Li, and Xero-Lyg. Each of these three are connected to the other documents I have prepared in one way or another. I would also like to point out that the entirety of the Exegesis of Merid-Nunda is meant to reveal how Meridia is in fact Merid-Nunda, and the evidence it provides to back up this claim is in fact completely sound. This is further supported by a passage from *The Imperial Census of Daedra Lords*, a text we at the IGS were forced to omit from the current edition of the pocket guide because of some…issues:

&gt;Meridia’s holdings in Oblivion are collectively known as “The Colored Rooms”. Another Prince whose origins may not entirely be outside of the aetherial, Meridia has at several times been linked to Magnus the Sun. The most famous account of this association is the Tract of Merid-Nunda, which overtly casts Meridia in the role of a wayward solar daughter, cast from the heavens for consorting with illicit spectra.

But I want to save Merid-Nunda for another of my reports, so you’ll just have to wait for that. The Exegesis also seems to say that these nine Sisters followed the ‘parabolas that led away from Magnus’, or in other words left Aetherius. My interpretation is that when it mentions Magnus, it really means the sun, and that the parabolas are in fact the sun’s rays that the Coruscations used to leave from Aetherius. But for what purpose?

The next two excerpts are from *Vehk’s Book of Hours*, written by the Warrior-Poet of Morrowind himself. I was provided with my own copy of the interesting tome after traveling to the land of ash myself and speaking with the priests of the now defunct Tribunal Temple. They were astonished to see an Argonian requesting the teachings of the disappeared Dunmeri god, but they eventually stopped laughing to the point where they gave me what I asked for:

&gt;“[…]Of special note is the Blue Star, which the Alesstics call ‘Mnemoli’, that runs through this part of the Aurbis every untime. The psijjics hold it in much reverence, and many of their folk make pilgrimages to Veloth when it appears because a mountain there catches fire at its passing. This mountain is reputed to be one of the last refuges of the Dwemer before they departed from this world[…]”

&gt;“[…]according to the texts, Mnemoli is a wayward child of ANU, one of a pantheon of forgotten deities known as the ‘Star-Orphans’…a tribe of gods and goddesses that apparently felt abandoned when the Sun Withdrew from the World-Making. Like many of her siblings, Mnemoli is both confused and delighted with the Aurbis, and explores its five quarters as best she can without the help and regulation of worship, which are not needed (by which I mean, always there) during breakings of the sideways wheel[…]”

The first text (I sent a full copy of the manuscript along with these notes, you are very welcomed Archmage) is about the alleged Dragon Break at the Battle of Red Mountain. As you well know, Dragon Breaks are phenomenons that occur whenever Akatosh looses his grip on time, causing several version of events to play out all at once. The Blue Star is stated by Lord Vivec to always appear during a Dragon Break, and passes over a mountain in Veloth (Morrowind) that catches aflame when it passes. Combine this with the statement about the Dwemer, and it clearly shows that the mountain is in fact the infamous Red Mountain of Vvardenfell.

Mnemoli is clearly Mnemo-Li of the *Exegesis* and this assumption is supported in the second passage. She seems to only appear in the ‘five quarters’ (Aetherius, Mundus, Void, Oblivion, and ?) of the Aurbis during Dragon Breaks. This particular piece also states that the Magne-Ge felt abandoned by Magnus after he fled from Mundus, and that they are an entire pantheon of forgotten deities. The fact that that she and ‘many of her siblings’ are both confused and delighted by the universe they left behind explains why there are so few references to them in the cultures of Tamriel; they are interested in but distanced from Nirn.

The last piece of writing (at least, to my knowledge) that mentions the Magne-Ge is Book 4 of the *Mythic Dawn Commentaries*. I must admit Traven, that I feel a strange sense of foreboding about this particular Daedric cult and its teachings; but nevertheless, I will list the relevant passages from their tomes here as well. I will spare you from reading my experiences procuring these from the Mythic Dawn, for I am not that cruel. Here are the relevant passages:

&gt;I give my soul to the Magna Ge, sayeth the joyous in Paradise, for they created Mehrunes the Razor in secret, in the very bowels of Lyg, the domain of the Upstart who vanishes. Though they came from diverse waters, each Get shared sole purpose: to artifice a prince of good, spinning his likeness in random swath, and imbuing him with Oblivion's most precious and scarce asset: hope.

&gt;Suns were riven as your red legions moved from Lyg to the hinterlands of chill, a legion for each Get, and Kuri was thrown down and Djaf was thrown down and Horma-Gile was crushed with coldsalt and forevermore called Hor and so shall it be again under the time of Gates.

&gt;Nothing but woe for NRN which has become The Pit and seven curses on its Dreugh, the Vermae NI-MOHK! But for it the Crusades would be as my lord's Creation, Get by the Ge and do as thou wilt, of no fetters but your own conscience! Know that your Hell is Broken, people of the Aurbis, and praise the Nu-Mantia which is Liberty!

The first thing that is surely to pique your interest (as it did mine) is the mention of the Ge creating Mehrunes Dagon in the ‘bowels of Lyg, the domain of the Upstart who vanishes’. This immediately recalls one to Xero-Lyg, one of the Nine Coruscations. The fact that the Star Orphans are accredited with creating one of the more destructive Daedric Princes is an interesting thought, but is also countered by other sources. For example, the infamously rare *Aldudaggavelashadingas* (Breton-Nordic folktales of a sort) give an entirely different origin for Dagon, but interestingly enough also mentions Lyg.

Lyg itself seems to be tied with the Ge, so let’s just say that the Commentaries are true. According to the author Mankar Camoran (surely this is just a pen name), the Star Orphans created Dagon by imbuing him with hope in the place (which seems to be a realm of Oblivion at best, another name for Tamriel at most? I don’t really know). Context makes it appear as if the Ge are working together for the first time in years for this event, which is fairly interesting.

The second passage mentions ‘as your red legions moved from Lyg to the hinterlands of chill, a legion for each Get’ makes me want to suggest the Imperial Legion (my little idea of a joke). But this red army seems to be compromised of different units/cohorts that represented every individual Get, and then went on to destroy the locations of Kuri, Djaf, and Horma-Gile (cities in Lyg? Countries?).

The last passage is almost completely indecipherable, but it once again states Mehrunes’s creation at the hands of the Magne-Ge, but also mentions The Pit (the realm of Peryite; I should know, I’m a former worshipper of his) and the creatures known as the dreugh. I have my own theories on this, but I will leave them out of this first report.

To sum up all of the things I have written down so far, we now know for certain the names of three Magne-Ge: Merid-Nunda (who is now for reasons still unknown the Daedric Prince Meridia), Mnemo-Li (or Mnemoli, the Blue Star), and Xero-Lyg (who might bear some connection with the mysterious realm of Lyg). We also know for certain that there are many more.

Now, I know I promised you a very enlightening text that I was able to procure through extraneous methods. But to avoid running out of things for the next several reports (and to ensure I receive compensation for all of my hard work before I travel to the Imperial territories in the east), I will purposely omit that from this treatise. Do not worry though; I insure you that I will supply you with all of the information you requested. I’m a very honorable Argonian, Hannibal.

Awaiting Payment,
