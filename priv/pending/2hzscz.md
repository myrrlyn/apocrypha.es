So you want to be an Akaneer, eh?


A noble calling if there ever was one, prospect! The Order of the Broken Wyrm is always looking for new candidates to support the Jillian Efforts, Whether it be through piloting the Voidships, Temporal Reconnaissance, or even things as basic as Minute-minding, which you yourself have shown an interest in.


And who wouldn't? Minute-minding is a gratifying field to find employment in, and is a service to all the denizens of the Mundus who are temporally minded, unlike a certain set of ungrateful trees. Your 12 cycle crash course in Minute-minding will acquaint you with all the basics in building the various Minute-minding devices used in the Jillian Efforts! Some of the things you will be learning are:


1. Chronocule degradation theory
2. Applications of Aetherial Dispersion
3. Margin of Error Training
4. The Importance of Redundancy 
5. And many more!


We look forward to seeing you Prospect!


For the Jillian Effort!
