&gt;#The Hamlet of the Gelid Mire: Morthal

Albeit a recently established settlement to the landscape of Hjaalmarch, this short section on Morthal has been included to provide a better understanding of it’s peculiar origin as well as keeping this guide up to date.^1

The village of Morthal was founded early in Third Era in the year 429 and is located east of Snowhawk in the more wet and muddy part of Hjaalmarch. A small settlement built mainly of wood, it actually rests on the southern edge of a marsh and is somewhat built on it, with stone foundation keep it from sinking into the fetid waters. The citizens here are hostile – even for Nords^2 – and are not fond of outsiders, and will usually drive them away before hearing the potential visitors out first. It especially hates the capital of Hjaalmarch, Snowhawk, and refuses to trade with it despite their close proximity with each other.

Morthal (named after the great hero Morihaus, the demigod son of Kyne) was created when the citizens of Snowhawk underwent a religious schism^3 in 427. A sect that primarily worshiped Kyne exiled themselves after disagreeing with Jhunal’s worshippers over which god should be primarily revered in the city. They eventually traveled to the wilderness, where they isolated themselves from the rest of the Nord population. Many of the other Hold’s Jarls (including the High King himself) view Morthal as a mere extension of Snowhawk, and feel that its villagers are just disillusioned. However, for all sakes and purposes, the town is clearly independent from the rest of Skyrim.

&gt;
&gt;No longer can we shelter ourselves with our brethren in Snowhawk! They have forsaken Kyne, War-Wife of Shor, in favor of Jhunal the Outcast. Yes, we must admit that it Jhunal’s Clever Men that originally founded the city. But it was Kyne who armed our ancestors, and it is she who deserves our respect. But the others in the city scoff at our ideals, saying that this was a place of magic before all else. And so shall we leave! We will forge a new path in the wilderness, and we will worship Kyne in peace.

Because of its nonexistent trade routes with the rest of Skyrim, the citizens of Morthal are left to fend for themselves. They are expert hunters and fishermen, and are strong practicians of herbalism. Although they abandoned much of the arcane practices of the mages of Snowhawk, they have retained their knowledge of animal magic and enchant their equipment with unique nature-oriented spells^4 and still use nature totems for a variety of rituals^5. Most of the villagers prefer not to fight unless for food or to protect themselves, and are actually rather peaceful despite their interactions with others.

&gt;
&gt;Let thy steel fly as fast as an eagle, be as sturdy as a charging bear, and be as strong as a mammoth when I use it against my enemies…

Despite its animosity with the other Nords, Morthal has a great love for Skyrim and will protect it at all costs. When Bandits encroach on their territory, the warriors of the hamlet will immediately set out and drive them away^6. They have killed many bounties, but have never collected on them. To some Nords, they are honorable heroes. To others, despicable savages.

High King Torbarik wishes to speak with the settlement of Morthal in order to work out some sort of agreement with its citizens and have it successfully incorporated back into Skyrim without bloodshed. We in the Imperial City can only hope he is successful.^7

Now, let us turn the page to the most mysterious settlement in Hjaalmarch. One that has been abandoned for centuries, Labryinthian.

^1. ^Pocket ^guides ^and ^‘up ^to ^date’ ^is ^a… ^funny ^notion ^to ^think ^about.

^2. ^Remove ^this ^before ^all ^the ^Nords ^in ^Tamriel ^start ^a ^riot. ^If ^they’re ^smart ^enough ^for ^such ^a ^thing, ^that ^is.
