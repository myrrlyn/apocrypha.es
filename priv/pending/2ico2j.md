**Fragment 3, "Death of fair Ami-El."**


  ...the land of Cyrodd had grown somber over the years, and so the passing of fair Ami-El was met with much weeping and quiet, uncomfortable thought towards the future, though the land had a capable and worthy heir. For many nights, the Lord and the Lady (for Ami-El had truly been both for her people) would not appear in the sky, so that it appeared even the stars mourned her passing.

Half of Nirn’s provinces bowed that day to the glory and honor of Empire.
  Each lord in turn approached and offered tribute to the new Emperor. Fierce Senche war-mounts, exotic and incredible raw materials, [untranslatable], fine moth silks, and ancient tomes and sagas were gifted between the more mundane offerings of wines, spices, gold and loyalty.
  That night, the Serpent chased the Apprentice across the sky as the emperor slept in his new chambers at the top of the White Tower. Few saw the portent, and fewer still understood it, but the Kothri tribeswoman departed swiftly, and her tribe….
