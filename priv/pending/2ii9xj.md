**[sic]Herbologie of the North**

 *Written in the early Third Era by Cintran Arellius, an Imperial scholar, Expanded Herbology of the North is often seen as a companion to the more prominent 'Herbology of Skyrim'.  It is more comprehensive and, by some, considered more accurate.*

**Blisterwort:** A a mushroom most often found in caves throughout the north, Blisterwort is a tall mushroom with a rough, crimson cap.  It is fairly edible, though it is recommended that one avoids excessive consumption.  Blisterwort has been noted to cause excessive, premature fatigue and seems to cloud the mind, predisposing one to rage.  However, when ground and mixed with wheat, the resulting mixture is both non-toxic and an excellent anti-inflammatory.  To use in a mixture, boil the entire fungus, stem and all.  Use resulting broth.

**Blue Mountain Flower:** One of several mountain flowers native to the northern lands, the Blue Mountain flower is distinguished by its soft petals and pale blue colour.  It is commonplace in foothills and just below the snowline on many peaks.  When crushed it makes a numbing agent that can be used to soothe wounds or aches.  When consumed, it functions as a general pain reliever.  To use in mixtures, grind petals.

**Canis Root:** The root of a small, gnarled bush common in the Reach.  The bush itself is often found in birch woods or along the bases of cliffs.  Though consumption can cause excess fatigue, it is said to greatly increase one’s dexterity, if only temporarily.  It is used in some mixtures as a paralyzing agent, and when mixed into a tea causes slight euphoria.  Common wisdom holds that rubbing the root against the roots of trees will ward off ursanthrothropes, though given the extreme rarity of such creatures, such actions are of little use.  It is typically chewed, but for use in a potion it must be boiled; use the resulting broth.

**Dragon’s Tongue:** A flower most common in the Tundra of Eastmarch, Dragon’s Tongue is distinguished by its bright yellow leaves, which bear an almost scaled texture, giving it it’s name.  Also known as the ‘cheater’s weed’, Dragon’s Tongue is said to enhance one’s ability to mislead others, and as such is often consumed by illusionists, merchants and gamblers.  Legend holds that a tonic made of Dragon’s Tongue will grant a man immunity to Dragonfire, but there is no evidence to support such absurd claims.  To use in a concoction, grind petals.

**Fly Amanita**:  A mushroom of medium height most often found in caves, Fly Amanita is distinguished by its large, bright red caps.  It is said to promote vigor and strength, but also, like its relative the Blisterwort, tends to cloud the mind and promote aggression.  However, unlike its cousin, Fly Amanita seems to foster bursts of energy as opposed to excess fatigue.  To use, boil entire plan, use resulting broth.

**Glowing Mushrooms (Moonroot)**: A rare variety of fungus found in many large caves, Moonroot is distinguished by its luminescent tone.  It is said by many to promote vigor and focus, and is a favourite of smiths.  It is also sometimes used in draughts to reduce headaches.  To use in a mixture, heat, dry, and grind into a powder.

**Imp Stool**: Imp stool is a short, plump fungus often found in the recesses of caves.  It is typically considered not edible; consumption causes immediate stomach pains and muscle aches, the soreness of which can last for weeks.  Common wisdom holds that it promotes endurance, though consumption is not recommended.  In some mixtures it can be used as a paralyzing agent.  Small amounts are sometimes used in draughts to cure insomnia.  To mix, dry plant and crush.

**Juniper Berries**: Small, green berries found on the Juniper Pine Bush, Juniper berries can be found primarily in the Reach.  Also known as the ‘Archer’s fruit’, Juniper Berries are said to increase focus and dexterity.  However, they are known to cause premature fatigue.  Juniper berries are often considered fair-tasting and are sometimes mixed into mead or pastries.  To mix, use juices.

**Purple Mountain Flower**: Often found at the bases of mountains, Purple Mountain Flowers are easily identifiable by their pale violet petals.  Consumption produces bursts of energy and, as such, ground purple mountain flowers are often mixed into teas.  Consumption has also proven to be effective in staving off frostbite, making knowledge of this herb essential to travellers to the North.  They are also sometimes used in small doses by herbologists to combat the flu.  For use in herbology and the mixing of potions, grind the petals of the flower.

**Mora Tapinella**: A short, orange fungus most often found at the bases of trees across the North (with the exception of the Rift), Mora Tapinella (also known as ‘Magecap’) is generally considered edible.  Consumption leads to bursts of energy and is said to refill one’s reserves of magicka.  However, it is an irritant and is not recommended for those with irritable bowels.  It is sometimes used in dyes due to its vibrant orange hue.  For use in the brewing of potions, boil the cap and use the resulting broth.

**Namira’s Rot**: A tall, brown fungus sometimes found in caves, Namira’s Rot is surprisingly useful, despite it’s ominous associations.  It has medicinal purposes; it functions as a numbing agent and an anti-inflammatory.  However, it is known to produce feelings of intense dread.  Folklore places it as a symbol of (obviously) the Daedric Prince Namira.  To use in a potion, an alchemist must heat the caps in order to dry them, then crush dried caps into a fine powder.

**Red Mountain Flower:** Like its relatives, the Red Mountain Flower is distinguished by its soft petals and gentle hue, in this case, a pale crimson.  It is not as common as its relatives, and is most often found in the northern regions of Skyrim.  It is said to promote both healing and vigor, and to strengthen one's connection to the Arcane; however, when used in excess, it can cause serious intestinal distress and sharp, painful headaches.  To use in mixtures, crush petals.

**Thistle Branch:** Harvested from Thistle Plants, Thistle Branches are found at lower elevations, especially in the southern pine forests.  Thistle plants are easily distinguishable by their violet flowers and soft, fair aromas.  Thistle branches serve as an excellent anti-toxin, and is often used to treat poisoning.  To use, grind into a fine powder.
