*Author's note - This interview was conducted in a small shack in the woods near the hamlet of Ipsham in the Breton kingdom of Menevia during the reign of the Akaviri Potentate in the Second Era. The subject is a witch who preferred to remain unnamed. The authorship is unknown, but this appears to be the third in a series of similar interviews all apparently conducted by a single Colovian male.*

**Thank you for your hospitality in having me in your home today, and in consenting to this interview. It was quite a trek out here to your cottage, and many people were unwilling to point me in the right direction. Are you a feared person in these parts?** 

"Aye, you might say that, young man. People fear what they don't understand, and many Bretons prefer to remain ignorant of people like me rather than attempt to understand us. You have nothing to fear from me today, however. Ask your questions. Perhaps your readers, at least, will have some of their prejudices dispelled." 

**Indeed. So, first off, I was under the impression that witches in High Rock were generally part of large covens. You appear to live all alone with only the woodland creatures of the region as your neighbors. Are you a solo practitioner?** 

"A silly question. I expected better of the bright young Imperial scholar. Bah. Shows what I get for optimism. Getting soft in my old age. Listen, young man. Those two things are not necessarily mutually exclusive. I am in a Coven - and no, I won't name it, for we suffer enough persecution as it is - but most of us live alone and only convene on auspicious days." 

**I was told you are a master of various healing potions and of conjuration. Do witches such as yourself dabble in necromancy, as well?** 

"Listen, young man. You seem eager, and sweet in your own way, but that's an ignorant question. It's also framed rather poorly. It's almost as if you're trying to get a rise out of me. That would be most unwise, here in my realm, but I'll forgive you this time. No, sonnie. I don't tamper with corpses. I don't force lesser daedra into piles of bones or rotting corpses. That would not only be disrespectful to the bones of my ancestors and cousins, but to the poor daedra being forced to serve. Many people don't consider the feelings of lesser daedra, but they're empathetic and aware."

**I was told that Witches often commune with the spirits of the dead, however. Was I misinformed?** 

"Not at all. I speak to spirits of various kinds. Many of them were once living persons. Many were not. I do not force them to serve me or to inhabit physical forms, however. Spirits have lives of their own, you know, just like you or me. Most people never consider that, but it's true. Now, these spirits ain't malicious things like the skeletons, wraiths or *faer gorta* of the old tombs. They're more like intangible presences. You have to be born with an innate ability to perceive them. They don't teach that in your Mages Guilds. "

**I was told that the various witch covens could cure people of Vampirism and Lycanthropy. Is this true?**

"I don't dabble in that type of study myself, young man. Some of the other Sisters may know more on the subject, if you can find them. I mostly commune with the spirits, and not the corrupted ones like that."

**Let's get back to a point you made previously. You said some of the spirits you commune with were never living people. Isn't that a contradiction? How can something be a ghost if it was never alive?**

"Again, your lack of understanding is apparent. It's not your fault. Your ways and beliefs are not mine. Who is to say what's right or wrong? Not this old woman. I'll tell you about the world as I see it, though. When you walked the old and worn out paths to my cottage, you probably saw the ancient forests. You saw the cobblestone remnants of the road. You saw the old, faded signs. You heard and possibly saw the woodland critters, and the babbling brook. All these things I perceive, but also the spirit realm. I see the world of the Fey Folk."

**Excuse me. The "Fey Folk"? I've not heard this particular terminology used before. Describe these folk to me.**

"I won't bore you with a theology lecture here, young man, but I'm aware that in Colovia they teach Creation in much the same way they do in High Rock. A buncha Greater Spirits decided to get together and make the world. Called it Convention.  Strongest Spirits became the Divines. The ones who were really strong but not quite that strong became the Earthbones. Now, as a spiritual woman, I realize that where there's bones, there's spirits. Same is true of Nirn, and the Earthbones. The Fey are the spirits of the world. Not everyone can see 'em, but I've always seen 'em. I've fostered relationships with them. That's why they allow me to live in these woods and commune with them." 

**You mention the Fey allow you to live in the woods. Are they related to Spriggans in some way?** 

"Oh, aye. Yeah. I guess you could say that. The Spriggans deign to take a corporeal form, but their essential spiritual form is much akin to the Fey-folken. First mortals who could commune with the woods and its spirits were the Druids of Galen, long ago. They protected this part of the world for many long centuries. Over time their number dwindled, like the Direnni culture they sprang from. There's a few orders out there who continue their practices, like the Wyrd Women, but their craft is far too stiff and formal for my Sisters and me. We prefer a more laid back approach. My patron is Tallatha, an elemental Spirit. Legend has it that long ago, the early Nords were oppressed by an evil warlord and his lieutenants. These wicked beings used magics their human subjects did not possess. Tallatha and her sisters took pity on mankind and gave them the ability to use the Storm Voice. This was one of the earlier types of human conjuration."

**You refer to the legendary Thu'um? The power to Shout? You believe this power actually existed, and represented a type of conjuration?**

"Almost certainly. I have a personal relationship with Tallatha. She is a mighty Wind Spirit. I can invoke her breath if need be, by connecting my mind to hers. When this connection is strong, I can summon powerful winds or fierce lightning on the clearest day. We witches call this divine breath the Fingers of the Mountain. It's similar in form and function to the Nordic Storm Voice. This power comes directly from the Spirits, and is therefore a form of conjuring. However, it is not to be abused and is only gifted to true friends of the Daughters of Kynareth." 

**The Fingers of the Mountain? The way you describe it, my friends from the Mages Guild would classify it as a destruction  spell.**

"Well, then your friends would be wrong."

**You speak sympathetically of Daedra, but also seem familiar and friendly with forces I'd consider Divine. Is this not a contradiction? In the Empire, Daedra are generally considered wicked and capricious entities.** 

"A foolish idea, truly. The principal difference between the spirits the Elves call Aedra and the ones they call Daedra is their role in Convention. The Daedra chose not to weaken themselves to create the world. Honestly, can you blame them? If someone asked you to sacrifice all your independence and freedom, would you? I honor and respect the Fey and the Divines for all they've given up, but I can't fault my Daedra friends for choosing to opt out. I've spent many hours convening with the Fey, but just as much time with the Daedra. In temperament they are much the same. Thinking of it as having friends from two different social strata, or who made slightly different life decisions. You wouldn't fault your friends who chose to study magic for not studying swordplay instead, now would you? Thus, I don't judge the Daedra."

**What advice would you give to my readers hoping for foster a relationship with supernatural entities of various types?**

"Honestly, you either have a natural affinity for it or you don't. If you have an affinity, tread carefully. You deal with powerful and dangerous forces. Myself, I never, ever speak to the Princes, or the more intelligent and malicious Daedra like the Dremora. I can't control that type of connection very well. Many sorcerers and mystics falsely believe they can, but the risks are too great. You'd be better off seeking out the Fey, or the lesser Daedra. You can learn a lot just by being friends with someone like that. Get used to being misjudged and disliked by people less observant than yourself."

**That concludes this interview. I thank you very much for your time. It's getting quite dark outside, isn't it?** 

"Yeah. If I were you I'd spend the night. You don't wanna travel through those woods in the dark. You can assure your readers I won't make a stew out of you or anything. You'd need the survival skills of a barbarian to survive those woods at night, and you don't seem to fit the bill." 

**Perhaps the barbarian I'm interviewing next week can offer me some insight there, but I think you're correct. Thank you again.**
