Marukh was born in the forests of Colovia in the Alessian Empire. He was the only son of poor Imga tickpicks but was always given much, that he might become a successful little ape, and his mother picked ticks all day, that she could give her son razors and people clothes. And his father picked ticks to buy fancy words for his son from the Great Archduke Viceroy Doctor Petati, who owned a dictionary and could read, and so sold words to the other Imga, and would beat anyone who would use a word or title they didn’t buy, this made him the richest Imga in the troop. And one midsummer’s night the Great Archduke Viceroy Doctor Petati threw a ball, and all the Imga gathered below his nest tree and danced and hit rocks and blew into grasses as if they were instruments. And Marukh grew bold in his new clothing and sashes and asked the Marchioness Dulsa to dance, and Marukh impressed her with his dancing and his words and his tick picking skills, and dulsa asked him to take her to his nest, and the two joined in holy connection, but the two called out as apes do in coitus and were discovered for their OH-OH AH-AHing, and Marakh was beat for his toying. And so Marukh ran off, and he heard the screams of his parents and his lover as they were beat to death, and Maruhk ran to the Stonemeadows, where he finally sat, and he cried and felt guilt for his wrong doings, and once he calmed down he looked to the sky and saw in the sky the Tower, and he raised his thumb to it, and therer he stayed, until his clothes rotted off, until his hair grew so long that Skooma addled Khajiit mistook him for the mane, and worshiped and fed him. And he thought for a century and he grieved the day he acted as an animal, and one night he had a realization, he could see the Tower in his thumb if he looked with both eyes. And he realized that there was no difference between his thumb and any Tower, and he learned the secret to making all the Towers become one, and to channel the Aurbis itself, and he looked up, and the old grey ape saw a beautiful woman in front of him and She spoke and Marukh was afraid he would forget, so he jumped from his perch and stabbed himself in the stomach, and he wrote down her words upon the rockface, and he call it the Beseeching Scarp and when the Shade faded the stone bore Seventy Seven Inflexable Doctrines, that when followed would prevent any young ape from losing his family, that would prevent death, and would give one life beyond the illusion of death. And Marukh returned to his troop and told them his words, and they became his shrewdness. And Marahk spread his Alessian Doctrines to the men of Cyrod, and he denied the Elves, who’s religion had tainted the Dragon Cult, and he told them of the love of Akatosh, and forced the empire into prudishness and the Men of Cyrod became like Anu-el, and they became static and they threw off their Podhomaic ways. And the Eagles of Auri-El refused to consume the men of Cyrod, for they had become calm, and they did not dance or drink or make coitus for fun.

Many years after Maruhk died a man called Fervidius Tharn became the Arch-Prelate of the Alessian Order, and he became the Secret Master of the Maruhkati Selectives and he looked over the tales of Ald and Auri-El and Auriel and Shor and Alduin and he looked for the Truth that is Akatosh in them, and he became assured of the Truth and he called upon the Selectives, and they danced upon The Whitegold, until they danced upon the Ada, and until they danced upon the Desert Dwellers, and the danced upon the Crystal, and upon the Sap, and upon Ash, and Snow, and upon brass, And they moved the Wheel into the Wheel, and Time fractured, and the Third Moon rose Elsewhere and the gods walked upon Nirn once more, and the Serpent came to the Towering places, and in his mouth were the Serpents, and the Eagle called and in his heart were the Eagles, and in his chest was the Auriel. And Tharn grabbed the two, for he commanded the beliefs of Cyrod, and he commanded the Towers, and he took his cutting words and cut open the Eagle and the Serpent. And he cut Auriel from Auri-El and let the made the lord sit aside, and he took the Tongues and set them aside and he took the Eagles and placed them also aside. And he reached into the Ovum of the Eagle, and took from it an Egg, and he blessed this egg, calling it Auri-El, that Auri-El would no longer be the time god, but the god of the beginning of time, and he threw the Phoenix back, to the first times, and he dug into the flesh of the Great Eagle and took from it the meat and gristle, and he blessed these calling them Ald. And he dug deeper and removed a kitten from the Bird and blessed it Alkosh, and he took the moltings of the Great Serpent Shor and sewed them onto the Eagle. And what is made by crossing an Eagle and a Snake? A Dragon, The Dragon, Akatosh, and Tharn gathered up the lesser Eagles and Serpents and smashed them together and he made them male and female, and the males were covered in scales and had leathery wings, and they were called Dov, and were given the Word of Kyne, and the females were long and covered in feathers and these quetzalcot were called Jills and Tharn gathered the Jills and stuffed Akatosh with them, and he called to them saying “Jills I have blessed the, emerge when the Dragon breaks and eat what does not belong, and make Time Anew, Is." And Tharn gathered two crowns from the head of Akatosh, and he place the first on the head of the mixed, the Dov and the Jills and Alkosh and various bits of Ald and Akatosh, and he blessed them, and he blessed the crown, calling it Akatusk, and he took the second and placed it upon the head of Akatosh and upon Alkosh and upon Ald who is the meat, and he took the crown into Nirn and Bound it, and condemned those blessed by it to death. And he blessed all that came from his digging and called them Aka. And he undanced, and the Aurbis fell from the Aurbis and the Eight Fell from the sky, and were bound once more. And the Jills began to fix time and this is the Time they chose for us after a thousand years of eating.

Auri-El became the god of the beginning of time, and after Convention Auriel, no longer bound to Nirn used Adamantine to Draco-Chrysalize and he grew himself a new time, and he sat alone, undreaming of anything but himself, a Stillborn Amaranth without imagination, without Royalty, cursed to IS forever without any IS NOT to change things, undeath by death. And Akatusk the ancient Dragon flew in past Kalpas, and Akatusk was the name of all dragons blessed by the First Crown, and Ald, the parts not Akatosh but still Time was given many names by many people. And Akatosh was bound to the Lulling Wheels with his Soul Brothers blessed by the Second Crown. And the People misremembered the Prophet from the East saying instead that dragons came from Akavir, and not the idea of them. And the war with the dragons was much easier, and the Three Fools became heroes. And the Maruhk’s teachings were seen as pious theology, and not necessary to prevent Eagle consumption. But the Eagles could not prevent the Aging of Atmora or the Atmorans, for their age was cast form Time. And the people misremembered the Agings, naming them Orkey, and calling them a god. And the Dragons with Alduin did not seek to devour the world, and they wished to rule it, and the Dragon Cult worshiped them in this new Time. But Alduin was still cast from Time, and was held there by Prophecy from the East. And Akatosh was Space-Time the Dragon Bridge, spanning the gap between the Two Soul Brothers. 

And this is how the Dragon was birthed, and how our History changed. And how our World was saved from being consumed as it usually is. Praise be to Man, for sowing seeds of undeath they will not reap, for others come in the Eagles’ name, and Maruhk’s lessons have been cast aside, and Padhomaism will mark Man to be slaughtered. But Nu-men will eat the crops of their thought father’s fields, and bless Men, and Bless Tosh Raka, the Father and Son of Akatosh.
