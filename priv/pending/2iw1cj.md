Here is the second part of my line of reports. Again any mistakes or suggestions, just let me know. 

First Emissary Elenwen,

More information has arisen on the individual we now know as the Dragonborn, or Ysmir. As if it wasnâ€™t enough that they were officially hailed by the Greybeards, it now appears that they are collaborating if not working for the remanets of the Blades. While the Blades no longer exist in anything but name, a few members of this heretical order have escaped justice and appear to be hiding in Skyrim. This cult aligned itself more closely with Talos later in the Third Era but suffered after they lost funding and support from an Emperor who was not dragonborn, and whom they did not officially support themselves. Their meddling in our affairs was another reason they were hunted down with such gusto here in the Dominion before the Great War. I digress though, this subject is well known to you, First Emissary. (Also I will see to it personally that those guards who were not killed during the raid on your soiree will be punished severely for their negligence for allowing the Blades to infiltrate our Embassy, we also mourn the passing of 3rd Emissary Rulindil.) 

However the new information that has been brought back is frustrating. It appears that our Justicars dispatched to the Ratway failed to capture the Blade member Esbern before he escaped with the Dragonborn. We have now lost track of both of these fugitives after they escaped from Riften. It is at your discretion but I recommend your agent Shavari wait in Riften in case the Dragonborn is foolish enough to return. We rue this loss for the moment because Esbern was possibly our best source of information on the return of the dragons. For the time being we will keep piecing together the available lore from Cloud Ruler Temple. We will also not cease in our efforts to hunt for these heretics. Information from our various sources and prisoners also hint that former Blade Delphine may be behind these recent coups against us, I will send her dossier with this letter in case you wish to review it. In the meantime I will spare no expense in terminating these threats.
