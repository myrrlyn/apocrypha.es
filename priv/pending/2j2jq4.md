*From the Office of Alandro Sul, Warking of New Resdayn*

The TRAITOR still walks and lives and breathes.

He poisons another world with his lies while our one lays dying.

He left to selfishly build himself an empire, to impose his will on others, to run away from the SHAME and EVIL that he committed beneath Red Mountain.

Now as the Corprus Horde creeps further towards Mournhold, we are left with no other choice.  The Psjiics have agreed to lend us their power for they see that the Corprus Horde cannot be stopped.  We will travel to the OTHER world,  the other Possibility.  We will find the TRAITOR and we will destroy him.

___________________________________________________________

Alandro Sul, No Longer Warking In This World stared in disbelief at the scene before him.  They were too late.  The Psjiic mumbled Hard Mathematics to himself even as the Tribunal walked towards them, newly Ascended.

"I thought we were supposed to come here before the event!" yelled Alandro, looking at the Psjiic.

"I...impossible..I must have..no, I made it very clear...we" mumbled the Psjiic.

*A God can do many things, mage* spoke Vivec, his voice a sickening majesty.

**YOUR CALCULATIONS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO CHANGE** spoke Sotha Sil

[Too late as always, Alandro](http://i.imgur.com/r2f5358.png) spoke Almalexia.

Alandro felt a cold rage overtake him and he drew Keening from its scabbard, running past the Tribunal towards the Heart.  Surprisingly, they parted and made way for Alandro, who, despite the strange actions from the Tribunal managed to keep on running.  

Alandro drew Sunder and jumped at the Heart, ready to deliver justice.  He came close to the heart, Keening barely a few inches away from it but he stood there.  In the air.  Floating like a fly in molasses.

Vivec appeared before him and gently lowered him until he was laying spread-eagled on the ground, unable to move.  Alandro heard the scream of the Psjiic, suddenly cut short.  

*What would your dear friend Nerevar think?  Is this your way to avenge his death?* spoke Vivec in a mocking, paternalistic tone.

Vivec placed his hand on Alandros forehead and Alandro saw what had happened in this Possibility.  He saw Dagoth Ur deliver the killing blow.  He saw Almalexia weep crocodile tears in front of the Chimer, telling them the news of the Nerevars death.  He saw Vivec's sickening smile as he held the Nerevars body close.

Alandro screamed in a supreme gesture of futile rage.

[Oh my poor, poor husband](http://i.imgur.com/r2f5358.png) spoke Almalexia

**I AM TRULY SORRY IT HAD TO COME TO THIS** spoke Sotha Sil

*I will grant you a mercy, Alandro.  I will spare your life.  But before I let you go...*  

Vivec crumbled Wraithguard, Keening and Sunder right before Alandros eyes, collecting the dust in his hands.  He blew and Alandro felt a cool wind pass over him.

Alandro awoke, coughing and spluttering.  Ash had coated his throat and the inside of his nose.  He crawled to a small lake and dunked his head.  He emerged and looked out around him.  Nothing but grey, ashen wastes.  He saw a small hill and on it were two Ashlanders, clad in long robes, watching him from a distance.
