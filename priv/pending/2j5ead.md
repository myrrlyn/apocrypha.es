This is my final report on the LBD that involve the main quest line. I've got some ideas for others so hopefully I can get those out soon. Any suggestions or mistakes just let me know. Again thanks for the feedback and continued interest, these have been fun to write. 

First Emissary Elenwen,

I have dire news, the rumors that the Dragonborn has journeyed to Solstheim have been proven true. Ancarion and his expedition team have gone dark, they were sent to the island in the hopes of learning the secrets of forging stalhrim from the Skaal by any means necessary. The last word we received from Ancarion was that they had abducted the Skaal’s blacksmith and was interrogating him for the information. After this, nothing, we have not heard word from them for several weeks. Along with trying to obtain the smithing secrets, they were also our only eyes and ears on Solstheim. I have not been able to muster the forces to travel to the island due to its remoteness and our previous lack of significant interest. 

This was a mistake though, and our folly was allowing the Dragonborn to travel there in the first place. They have now returned to Skyrim proper and I fear that they have grown even more powerful. We have only heard whispers and unsubstantiated rumors but from what Ancarion elaborated in his missives was that the whole island had come under the influence of one called Miraak. Though Ancarion had little idea of who this figure was, it didn’t interfere with his mission and he heeded it little attention. We should have had more substantial forces in place on the island as soon as we learned the Dragonborn had sought passage. From what little information I can piece together, I believe the Dragonborn traveled there to confront this Miraak. Now how this transpired is not known to me, after the last missives from the expedition team, we have only rumors and conjecture to stand on. 

What is known to us now is that the Dragonborn has returned and they are flushed with new power. My scouts report watching them use their Voice to literally bend the will of a group of bandits so that they immediately turned on their comrades. It appears he can also now be seen as the aspect of a dragon, this is troublesome sign because Nordic myth has similar stories of people not being able to look upon Ysmir without seeing a dragon. There is no doubt now that the Dragonborn is literally Ysmir come again. The final and most disturbing reports are the sightings of the Dragonborn enter battle with a dragon, but instead of killing the wyrm, use their Voice to tame the beast and then ride upon it! First Emissary, my faith has been shaken that we can now stop Ysmir, he has slew dozens of dragons and gains power with each one, now he has returned with the power to literally bend and reshape the very rock to his will. I beseech you, we have failed up to this point, and now I fear it is too late to stop this rising tide.

-- Erraille 3rd Emissary

 

A Letter to all Thalmor Justicars,

The position of 3rd Emissary is vacant once again, I will select worthy candidates from among you. Erraille has been sent back to Alinor for punishment and re education. A reminder to you all, do not fail me.

By my hand and seal,
 
Elenwen
