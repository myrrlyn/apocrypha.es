Was asked to continue these reports for the Dawnguard dlc. Trying to decide on how to reconcile the choice in quest line into a main report. Again any mistakes or suggestions are welcomed to be pointed out.

Addressing all Thalmor Justicars,

Our many scouts and informats are beginning to bring to light attacks on Skyrim’s populace at large. These are of a wholly different nature, divorced from Stormcloak or Legion attacks. These seem to be aimed at the residents of the province themselves. We have concluded that these are vampire attacks. There is only one documented vampire clan in Skyrim that is known of, the Volkihar. These vampires are particularly dangerous as they are believed to haunt the northern regions of the area, and are able to reach through the ice without breaking it, dragging their victims under. Attacks so far seem to be scattered and it is unknown if all of these are carried out by the Volkihar clan, or if these are simply embolden vampires. What clearly was the work of the Volkihar was the sacking of the Hall of the Vigilants of Stendarr. In one fell swoop the vampires seemed to have neutralized the Vigilants. There is conjecture on why they carried out such a bold attack, but the most obvious conclusion is that it was a message, they are not to be trifled with. Attacks against our Justicars have been few and far between, but the fact that this clan seems to have been marshalling its strength in secret is a threat to the Thalmor no matter their agenda. While we have yet to discern the purpose of this sudden outbreak of violence, it is clear that we must be on our guard. All Justicars traveling between cities are advised to refrain from the roads at night. Also be on the look out for groups of Vigilants of Stendarr, they are most likely vampires using a disguise and any smart Vigilant will have forsaken their ideals or gone into hiding. Finally we will be marshalling more guards at Northwatch Keep, we believe the Volkihar’s lair to be near by, the guards have told of shadows moving in the night to and fro near the Keep. To summarize, avoid travelling at night, beware of suspicious characters in the towns, and be observant!

By my hand and seal,

Elenwen
