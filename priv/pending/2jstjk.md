Some have asked me to continue on with these Thalmor reports, looking at the major factions of Skyrim. As always an mistakes or suggestions are welcomed. 

Addressed to new Thalmor Justicars in Skyrim.

Welcome, if you are reading this then you must be one of the newly arrived Justicars from Alinor to Skyrim. Make no mistake, this is a dangerous posting. We have lost many of our agents and Justicars due to various reasons.  As we have operated in Skyrim longer we have begun to learn more about the factions and various organizations in the province. Obviously this is not a cultural study or for simply for prosperity. These reports will help you familiarize yourself with the politics and workings of Skyrim at large, as well as help you succeed in your individual postings and assignments. Skyrim is the perceived “Fatherland” of many races of men, it is vital that our authority and sovereignty are able to be exercised here freely. Thus we ensure the success of our cause, and the obvious superiority of mer over men, even in their own birthplace. Familiarize yourself with the cartography available and different cities of the region and await further in depth reports to come.
