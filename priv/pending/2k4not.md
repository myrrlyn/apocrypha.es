Here is the next entry in these reports. Again I have focused on how these factions appear at the start of their respective quests. Feel free to point out mistakes or give me suggestions as always. 

This report only pertains to a relatively small number of you, but it shall be distributed to all new Justicars for your overall information. The College of Winterhold is located in the town and hold of the same name in frozen reaches of the northeastern part of the province. This independent campus survived the dissolution of the Mages Guild at the end of the Third Era. They also have managed to stay neutral despite pressures from the successors of the Mages Guild, the Imperial Synod and College of Whispers. This institution is not open to all and selects its students based on magical skill and ability. However the College has struggled since the end of the Oblivion Crisis, and the Great Collapse. The Collapse was a natural event all but destroyed Winterhold, but left the College relatively untouched. This is likely due to any magical protection that was placed on the building in its early years. The Nords, in their perpetual ignorance, see this as evidence of a conspiracy. Now the College is shunned by the province at large and viewed with suspicion. As of currently, we already have an agent in place, Ancano. He is to keep an eye on the College for anything of interest or useful to our agenda, although this is doubtful from a second rate institution in the frozen wilderness of Skyrim. 

 There is one curiosity, the Ysmir Collective. In the late Third Era the College apparently came into possession of a large library of books known as the Ysmir Collective. Apparently it was saved from destruction of in the east.  This collection of books was said to be the cornerstone for academia in the College and many traveled just to study the Collective. There are many questions surrounding this collection of the books, and needless to say, any reference to Ysmir has our full attention. We have tasked Ancano with finding what remains of the Collective or its significances. Any Justicar to come across new references to it should send their reports to the Embassy promptly.

 Justicars are asked to avoid unnecessary contact with Ancano as he has said that he is already not trusted by nearly all at the College, allow him to ingratiate himself into the institution before approaching him directly. If contact is necessary, report to Ancanoâ€™s adjutant, Estormo. We have few suspicions of Talos worship inside the College, however the Jarl of Winterhold has aligned himself with the Stormcloak cause, while these heretics must be persecuted, in this moment a rebellion suits our purpose, we will watch and observe until the time is right. In short there is little of value to be gleaned from this College, with an agent in place we will observe and monitor.

Status: Agent in place, maintain role of advisor, no contact unless absolutely necessary. Emissary Level Approval.
