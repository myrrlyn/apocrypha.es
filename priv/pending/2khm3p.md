As requested here are links to previous reports.

At a time this group was one of the most feared of all assassination guilds. However today it is a shadow of its former glory. It is reported that there is only one operating sanctuary in Tamriel at the moment, and it is thought to be somewhere in the Pine Forest of Skyrim. The Dark Brotherhood has fallen from its former status as one of the most respected groups that carry out murder and assassination. Rumors persist that at the end of the Third Era, due to treachery within their ranks, a great many of their members were killed by one of their own. This no doubt left the Brotherhood in dire straits as the Fourth Era began. Many of you might remember some of our preemptive strikes against Brotherhood members before and during the Great War. We couldn’t leave a group of assassins with free reign in a war torn Cyrodiil. However many went to ground in their remaining Sanctuaries. Even after the War was over, times has not been good to the Brotherhood. It seems that social unrest in Hammerfell, High Rock and Cyrodiil have resulted in a destruction of many of their remaining hideouts. It seems that sometime after 4E 188, the Brotherhood no longer operated in Hammerfell and Elsweyr and only maintained sanctuaries in Skyrim and Cyrodiil. Even today that number lingers as it only controls one remaining sanctuary near Falkreath here in the province. 

It’s rites and practices are secret to all but its members, few actual truths about the Brotherhood have been known to the public. There's only one thing an outsider needs to know about the the guild. How to summon them. It is known that the profane ritual known as the Black Sacrament will result in a visit from one of its members. Apparently one is to make an effigy of the intended victim made from actual body parts including a heart, skull, bones, and flesh. This ghastly ritual is complete when one then stabs the effigy with a dagger rubbed with the petals of the poisonous nightshade plant, and they pray to the “Mother” to baptize the sins of the unworthy with blood and fear. 

This undoubtedly refers to the Night Mother, the patron of the Dark Brotherhood. Who or what this Night Mother is has been debated down the centuries. Some believe that it is merely a title given to the leader of their sanctuaries, yet some believe a more sinister tale. Sithis, the Void incarnate to some, begat a women five children, who he then ordered her to kill. The locals of the town she lived in killed her in turn, and they believe she lives on as the Night Mother a conduit of sorts to Sithis. There is one more rumor that is seldom heard, that the Night Mother is no other than the Daedric Prince Mephala. It seems she delights in influencing mortal affairs, and to purposely deceive an entire organization into believing something false fits her way of operating perfectly. The truth however may never be fully known. 

To the eyes of the Thalmor this is a guild that is past its prime, posing little threat to us, but we cannot discount them entirely. It appears we are not the only who share this view. The Penitus Oculatus, the Emperors personal bodyguard and less well known, agents of subterfuge against enemies of the Empire. (They will be discussed more fully in a later report.) They have also taken an interest in the Dark Brotherhood and have actively been watching them. What moves they will take against the Brotherhood are not known as of late, but we shall maintain vigilance on the situation and let this play out. No need to involve our agents if we will let our enemies do it for us. 

In conclusion the Dark Brotherhood is little to no threat against our agenda here in Skyrim. Any Justicars who are assailed by their members may use any and all means to eliminate them. We shall let Imperial assets deal with the problem, it is mutually beneficial to us if they do, so we will remain hands off, but stay ever watchful of the situation.

Status: Limited threat level, execute on sight, allow Imperial Forces to operate against them.
