I awoke coughing and spluttering as the water lapped up around me and found its way into my nostrils.  I quickly stood and up just as quickly collapsed again, finding my legs unable to carry my body weight.   I suppose it was a few hours later that my thirst woke me up again.  This time I managed to get up and stay up.  I found myself surrounded by familiar terrain and flora.  I was home.

I spent about an hour walking into the thick forest near the beach, looking for a stream or river to follow hoping against all hope that some civilization was nearby.  The further I went inland, the more apprehensive I became.  At last the fading daylight streaming in from the gaps in between dense fungus towering above me showed me that I was running out of time and I was hopelessly lost.  I had found no water source, save for the small puddles forming in depressions in the soft loamy soil.

I huddled under a tree in the inky blackness.  The fear of the unknown slowly creeped up on me and I found myself frantically looking for anything that might help.  I spied a dim light in the distance.  As I did so, I heard a rustling in the bush behind me and the primitive, animal side of me immediately took over.  I ran like a bolt of lightning towards the light, tripping and stumbling over every root and branch, the adrenaline blocking the pain.  I looked upon the light source, finding myself crying out with wild delight when I saw a familiar doorway.  I was so happy that I burst through the door, a huge mistake.  I lost my footing and plunged into the inky blackness of the ruins below.  

I again awoke, this time with a broken leg.  I cried out into the once familiar halls, hoping for anyone to come and get me.  Nothing but echo and the churning of mechanical gears and the bubbling of magma.  I looked around more closely at my surroundings.  The lights still worked but the metal was rusted over and all our beautiful tapestries were gone, some hints of them lying in tattered pieces on the floor.  How long was I gone?

I crawled along the floor in agony, hoping to find an infirmary that still had supplies stocked.  I turned a corner and caught a glimpse of a thin figure running off into the shadows.  I cried out in desperation.

**HELP ME**

I immediately regretted what I had done.  I had been gone for a long enough time that the metal had rusted and any sense of comfort had rotted away.  There would be no one here.  So whatever that thing was, it wasn't one of my people.  Cold fear gripped me.  What was that?  Some kind of...NO.  I wasn't a child.  I didn't have time to slow myself down with silly notions in my head.  It was clearly afraid of me, so I had nothing to fear.  I just needed to find an infirmary and get out of here.

After crawling through the abandoned hallways, I found a small room.  I went through many of the barrels and finally found something that could help.  It was a potion of Paralyzation and I quickly poured it into the wound.  I used the blessed absence of pain to construct a crude splint and straighten up the bone.  Within a few minutes I was able to hobble out of the room again.  

As I struggled up some stairs, I heard a strange sound coming from behind me.  It was unlike the usual hum of the steam coming through the pipes.  It was more like a soft whisper.  I stopped and tried to hone in on the sound and almost immediately wished I hadn't.

*helpmehelpmehelpmehelpmehelpmehelpmehelpme*

My heart started to beat faster which only caused the pain in my leg to start up again.  I began to hobble as fast as I could to somewhere, anywhere.  As long as it was away from this...thing.

I felt it watching me from the shadows behind me.  I was wild with fear, my vision blurred with tears and finally I began to hop away as fast as I could.  My fear grew worse as I heard small sounds like bare feet on metal behind me.

*help...me*

**NO, LEAVE ME ALONE**

My threat was of no use.  Instead it took the words and repeated them, as though trying it out.  

*noleavemealone*

Finally I turned around and screamed into the empty hallway behind me.  Nothing was there.  I could feel my heart trying to jump out of my throat and I did my best to see into the darkness.  Nothing.  I turned.

The thing was there, in front of me.  I screamed.  **IT** screamed.  I fell to the ground and it leaped on top of me in some sick mockery of two lovers playing.  It screamed with a force that shook the very bones in my body.

**HELP ME**

**HELP ME**
