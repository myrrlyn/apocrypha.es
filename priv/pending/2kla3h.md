**Dedications and Acknowledgements**

I dedicate this data text to my dear friend Anumas of the New Aldmeri University. Without his steadfast support, my research would have been impossible.

I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of my assistant, Thaena Storm-Arm, for both her protection during our trips to some of the more dangerous locations and her resourcefulness during the Grey Wind. It is thanks to her medical skill that I am merely terminally ill instead of a corpse.

With this said, it is time to begin.

**Introduction**

The 5th Era of Tamriel is widely considered by laymen and scholars alike to be a time of chaos and confusion. We know little of what happened during that time, other than the famous legend of the Brass God and Jubal Lun Sul. The Digitals are still out on whether that tale is history or mere legend, but it is universally agreed that some calamity struck the plane formerly known as Nirn and caused a diaspora across the Aurbis. 

Despite our limited knowledge of the 5th Era and even more limited knowledge of the times before, some relics of the ancient past have been recovered by expeditions to the dead body of Nirn. These artifacts shed light on some of Tamriel's ancient cultures and their belief systems. The most interesting find we have made is an ancient text called "Varieties of Faith in the Empire", a text detailing the many religions of Ald-Tamriel. Such a gift has given us great insight into the faiths of the ancients.

I hope to follow their example with this book. Perhaps some day in the future our culture will be the one buried under rubble and another civilization will be examining us. If I have learned anything, calamity can strike at any time. This record will immortalize our cultures, both good and bad, for ages to come. I cannot think of a better book to be my last work.

Without further ado, The Faiths of the Sixth Era.
