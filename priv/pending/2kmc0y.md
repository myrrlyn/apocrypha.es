**Chapter 1: Vehkism**



Vehkism has its origins in one of the early expeditions to Ald-Tamriel. Perseus Aricci is acknowledged as the founder.

A rich Cerodian of the Vineyard Planes, tired with the materialistic culture he was a part of, he sold all his properties and used the money to finance an expedition across Oblivion to examine the remains of the Starry Heart. According to his later biographers, he reasoned that he would either find meaning for his life or he would be released in death.

He and his team of Mirror-Logicians descended to the surface of Nirn, in those days still covered with some AE Denial Interference particles, and used an early version of Fractal Impossipoint Reconstructionism to recover Tonal Data lost during the Deafening. 

Months dragged on without any results. Ald-Tamriel seemed totally wiped of any Tonal Data. Things got so bad that some of Perseus' men revolted and had to be put down, an event which modern Vehkists call the Genesis Apostasy. However, there is not any evidence that suggests the revolt was religiously motivated. Regardless of the cause, Perseus was able to put it down with his remaining loyal men. 

The supplies eventually ran out. It looked like the entire trip was for naught. Here is where the myth begins.

The Vehkists claim that as Perseus and his men were wasting away from hunger, even contemplating cannibalism, a figure appeared from nowhere. The mysterious figure was recorded to be "one who was like both male and female, part gold and part ash."(Annals of the Prophet)

Miraculously, the impossipoints in the surrounding area temporarily reformed into "an oasis in a desert of ash, next to a great burning mountain." 

The men and mer were awed at the sight, which is noted to be strikingly similar to how ancient Morrowind was described. They ate their fill at the lavish banquet prepared for them while their mysterious saviour floated in a crosslegged position. 

Once finished, Perseus went to the strange mer and asked his name. Their savior briefly told Perseus that his name was Vehk. As soon as Perseus and his men were finished, the world they saw began to fade into the barren wasteland they had found earlier. 

According to the Annals, 

"Perseus reverently walked to Vehk and asked how ze brought the world back. 'Silly grandchild of the Cyrods. I am a Ruling King. Only royalty can do what you have witnessed. The Aurbis does not bow to commoners.'"

Perseus, puzzled by hir words but in awe of hir power , asked another question.

"How can I be royalty?"

Vehk was said to have smiled at him and said, "Reach Heaven by Violence."

(Annals of the Prophet)

Whether or not the conversation between the mythical Vehk happened, Perseus returned from Nirn a changed man. He walked the streets of the Vineyard Plane, telling people his amazing story. His preaching was consistently ignored by the public. In fact, they became so annoyed with him that the Vineyard Plane banished him to the Deadlands. 

Perseus, filled with doubt and depression, was preparing to accept death until chance(or Vehk, depending on who you ask) intervened. A wandering tribe of Chromeguards happened to be passing through the Deadlands on their way to another plane. 

These Chromeguards, in a rare act of compassion, took Perseus in. Curious how a Cerodian ended up alone in the Deadlands, they asked him about his story. So Perseus told them his tale, and unlike the arrogant people of the Vineyards, they listened. 

Many Chromeguards were intrigued by Vehkism's theology. The central belief of all Chromeguards is to reach the Far Shores by proving themselves worthy enough to Tall Papa. They interpreted the phrase "Reach Heaven by Violence" as supporting their goal. Convinced that Perseus was a prophet of Tall Papa, they elevated him to the role of a religious leader in their society.

Perseus Aricci changed his name to Hallin Amam and took to the new role with vigor. He spent sixteen days in meditation, and when he came out he delivered several decrees that became the main tenants of Vehkism.

1. War is the way to Transcendance. 

2. Heaven belongs only to the strong.

3. Violence against the unworthy isn't violence at all. 

4. You will be judged by the number of heads you collect, not the number of lives you save. 

5. A dishonorable kill does not count towards the goal. 

6. When the entire Aurbis has been conquered, the blood of those killed in the war will bring Nirn back to life. It will serve as the capital of the Heavenly Empire, an empire that will never fall. Only the strongest of the Vehkists will live on Nirn, and the greatest warrior in history will be its emperor. 

These tenants immediately caused tension in Chromeguard society. The majority of Chromeguards felt that Vehkism strayed too far from their original goal, and demanded that the Prophet be silenced. Others, however, were excited at the ideas Vehkism presented. For some Chromeguards, the Far Shores were not enough. They wanted more than simply being granted passage to a realm they knew nothing about. 

The strife caused by the Prophet's decrees eventually exploded into a civil war. After three years of war, both sides were too weak to annihilate each other. The Vehkists split from the orthodox Chromeguards and disappeared to lick their wounds, recruiting people from other planes in the process.

They currently await a figure called The Magna Ymladdwr , the one who will be the greatest warrior in history. Many have tried to prove they are the Magna Ymladdwr, but as of this writing none have been formally recognized.

No one knows what became of Hallin Amam, but his Annals have immortalized him. The religion he founded has become one of the most influential ideologies of the Sixth Era, responsible for numerous wars and even the fall of several nations. Fighters from all cultures flock to them to prove their worth. 

There are only two possible ends to Vehkism: Either the Vehkists are destroyed, or the Vehkists will achieve their bloody goal. Only time will tell who will win.
