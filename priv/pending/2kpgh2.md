Here's my report on the Legion in Skyrim. Hopefully I fixed the mistakes I made in the Stormcloak report, but if you see any more feel free to point them out. 

It is clear to all Justiciars and agents of the Aldmeri Dominion that this peace between ourselves and the Third Empire is nothing more than the calm before the storm, and a storm is coming. It is obvious that we hold the upper hand in this peace. The Dominion was able to dictate terms to the Empire nearly identical to those we demanded at the start of the Great War. However, we do face an obstacle, that is the Imperial Legion. In the war we were able to smash through their defenses due to the surprise we achieved early on in our invasion. What we did not anticipate was how they were able to solidify and stiffen their lines in Cyrodiil after we had taken the Imperial City. Then Lord Naarifin’s tactical error of remaining in the city as he held his ground in the city as it was slowly surrounded. It is clear that under a competent leader, as Titus Mede II annoyingly proved himself to be, the Legion is still a force to be reckoned with. Now Justicars in Skyrim will be dealing with the Fourth Legion under the command of General Tullius. 

The Fourth Legion like all Imperial Legions number about 5,000 men along with their auxiliary units. Their ranks consist of mainly Imperials and Nords, there are groups Redguards and Bretons in their ranks with even fewer elves. Many Orcs are also part of the Legion and are held in high regard for their fighting prowess. High Elf traitors are being specially marked, not only those among the Legion but in Skyrim’s populace as well. Local recruiting has ensured that they are at nominal strength, however that is their extent and they have received very few reinforcements from Cyrodiil. They are trying to keep as many legions on their border, they won’t be taken by surprise a second time. Their headquarters is in Castle Dour in Solitude, where the General is usually to be found. Now Thalmor agents have free reign throughout Legion command posts and camps, and it is encouraged that you grace them with your presence from time to time, to remind them of who is true power here. Relations with the Legion leadership here in Skyrim are cordial at best, but both know that will not last long. The Thalmor also retain the right to sit in on any treaties or agreements the Empire make to make sure that the conditions of the White Gold Concordat are upheld. The Empire grudgingly allows our Justiciars and agents to move within their borders to root out the Talos heresy, it also affords the Thalmor opportunities to gather intelligence on their troop movements, concentrations, size and command structure. The Empire, of course, has no such overt measures of reconnaissance within the borders of the Dominion. (Discussion on the Penitus Oculatus forthcoming.)

The Legion has troops stationed in several holds including Haafingar, Hjaalmarch, the Reach, and Falkreath. Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun has refused the right of the Legion to quarter troops within the city, yet he also refuses to acknowledge Ulfric’s claim to High King of Skyrim. Therefore our operations within the hold of Whiterun are less overt. We know that in the holds that support the Stormcloaks such the Pale, Winterhold, the Rift and Eastmarch the Legion has several hidden camps, these are usually commanded by a Legate and are relatively small in size. The continuing civil war benefits our agenda as discussed at length in the report on the Stormcloaks, it must be reiterated that we must take every measure in order to ensure that this civil war continues on as long as possible. In keeping the Fourth Legion pinned down in Skyrim, we are ensuring that the resources and manpower of the Empire are drained as they fight their own subjects, distracted from their real threat. 

As a broad overview, the Imperial Legions are the Dominion’s biggest obstacle in our long term goals. That being said the loss of Hammerfell as an Imperial province has weakened the Legion as most Redguards are embittered against the Empires “abandonment” of them at the end of the Great War. The civil war in Skyrim is exactly what we need to occupy the Legion and distract it from our borders, although its likely that many eyes are still upon us in Cyrodiil. The Dominion will not have the same element of surprise it did when we launch our invasion in 4E 171, although our leadership in Alinor is no doubt reading new plans that will allow us to strike again with the same surprise and cunning. 
 
To conclude, the Thalmor have the upper hand over the Empire and its legions at the moment. Due to the conditions of the Concordant we are able to move within their lands with impunity and root out Talos worship, while gathering intelligence and observations. We can continue to exploit this advantage until the very last moment when I’m sure we shall have even bigger parts to play within the provinces we are assigned to. 

Status: Maintain the illusion of peace for the time being, gather information on troop locations and sizes, ensure that Legion is tied down fighting the rebels for as long as possible. Emissary Level Approval.
