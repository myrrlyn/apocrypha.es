* To the Listener of the Dark Brotherhood
* Sundus, 8th of Sun's Dusk, 4E 20X

Listener,

This letter may come as a surprise as our two organizations have rarely had much contact and have relied on our unspoken rules of conduct. However there is a new threat that is looming that may require an unorthodox retaliation. 

The Thalmor have slowly seeped into our province and have only begun their work of targeting Talos worship, this however is not the problems of our organizations. These elves will not stop there, not until they stand unopposed in every corner of Tamriel.

I suggest an alliance, the Thalmor will start to pick us off one by one unless we can diminish their influence here in Skyrim. We can read the writing on the wall and ignore it, or we can start to act now. What say you?

A potential friend,

The Guild Master of the Thieves Guild
