Farewell sweet leaves,

farewell sweet trees,

leaves glistening in the winds.

Farewell Falinesti

the city that walks

the city that roams free.

Farewell blue streams of Valenwood

running wild through the Green.

Farewell sweet Jagga,

Imga and Orc,

here under the trees.

My story has been spun,

it has come to a close

for Y'ffre has told that it must be,

here under the Green.
