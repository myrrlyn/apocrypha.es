The substances of Moon Sugar and Skooma have greatly affected social, economic, cultural, and religious aspects of nearly all races in Tamriel, with almost all of the users being Khajiit. But before we discuss the effects that Moons Sugar and Skooma have on Tamriel, we must first have a strong understanding of what these substances are.

Moon Sugar: an illegal and addictive drug found in sugar canes native to the Tenmar Forest of southern Elsweyr. Raw substance.

Skooma: a refined version of Moon Sugar. Has the same effects on the consumer as Moon Sugar, but to a larger extent. Can be smoked, drunk, or eaten.

**Uses**

The drugs of Moon Sugar and Skooma are used because they can benefit the user in various ways. The most common way Moon Sugar and Skooma benefit the user is by acting as a recreational drug. The effects of the drug are as follows: an acute energetic bodily sensation that gives skooma users an increase in physical strength and speed while impairing one's ability to rationalize or respond quickly to stimulus. Prolonged use of skooma has been known to cause dangerous psychological and physical addiction and in some cases, death. Other uses for Moon Sugar and Skooma include, but are not limited to: seasoning for meats and complimenting spices, an active ingredient in alchemy, and in Khajiit religious ceremonies.

**Religion**

Moon Sugar and Skooma are held in high positions in the Khajiit religion, seen as gifts from the gods, often serving an important role in religious ceremonies involving the moon gods Jone and Jode. The substances are held to such a high religious standard that the Khajiit believe that if they consume Moon Sugar or Skooma, they are partially consuming the wisdom and power of the moon gods Jone and Jode, a religious experience which gives them large amounts of ecstasy and euphoria. Some beliefs hold that the sugar is crystallized moonlight caught in the water of the Topal Sea and brought to the sugarcane groves of the Tenmar by the force of the twin tides. Overall, the substances of Moon Sugar and Skooma are glorified and romanticized in the Khajiit religion and culture, to the point that partaking in the consumption of the drugs is not only accepted, but encouraged. It is not uncommon to see many Khajiit in euphoric episodes at many major cities in Elsweyr. 

**Trade and production**

It is not uncommon to stumble upon a large Moon Sugar plantation in the lands of Elsweyr, and occasionally Morrowind. The publicity of the drug production can be attributed to the cultural and religious acceptance of it, but also the lack of state intervention to stop the large epidemic. In the 5th era, there has not been a single distribution and/or production market. In fact, the only known time that almost all Moon Sugar production was under a single distributer and/or producer was Around the year 3E 433 when a known skooma smuggling ring operated out of Cheydinhal, and an entire residence was converted into a skooma den in the Cyrodiilic town of Bravil. This was also the first time a large smuggling ring had established firm ties to foreign territories. Moon Sugar and Skooma are most commonly smuggled to Argonia on ships, and to Valenwood on horseback. The trade is large in Morrowind to to the Dunmer's common interest in the drugs. The trade is fairly weak in Cyrodiil and other Imperial territories due to the Empire's enforcement on the ban of the narcotics. 

**International Opinions**

Options on the Moon Sugar and Skooma depend on the race of a person, his/her upbringing, and his/her place of origin. In the lands of Morrowind, the drug is heavily looked down upon, and is seen as a symbol of the poor and lazy; merchants will not do any business with a person if he/she is carrying any of the substances. In Cyrodiil and other Imperial territories, the drug and its users are not as looked down upon, as the number of users is far lower in the empire. In Argonia, the drugs are looked towards with neutrality, and most people are busy doing other things to ponder the importance of the substances. Most other places in the empire, the drugs are too scarce for citizens to care any about them.
