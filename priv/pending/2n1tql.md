In the land of Resdayn, that is, Morrowind, there lived a Dwemer named Judeth. She was known throughout the land as the finest locksmith that ever lived. It was said that she invented the lock, but she would deny this. "I did not invent the lock," she would say. "But I did perfect it. And this is a greater feat."


One day, Judeth issued a challenge throughout all the land. And she said, "Are not my locks the greatest, most beautiful and most secure in all the land? If any mer or man can open my greatest lock without its key, I will give him the contents of the chest it seals shut, the object that is most precious to man and mer, that which kings and queens would surrender their lands and riches for."


Then men and mer answered the challenge. Shining Chimer tried to solve the riddle of Judeth's lock, but always were baffled by it's cunning pins. Wise Dwemer lifted and tested the springs to coax their secrets from them, but the tumblers remained secure and the chest remained shut. And many Dwemer wise in their own eyes returned unto their stone rooms and pondered the meaning of their failures.


Thirteen days times thirteen passed and no man or mer could thrust open the lid of the chest and wrest the treasure from its opening. And Judeth declared, "Is no one in all of Nirn capable of opening this lock and claiming the treasure therein?"


And after three days a strange woman came unto Judeth. She had the appearance of a cat, and yet she walked on two legs, like mer and man did. And she spoke with strange words and strange ways.
And she bowed low to the ground and said, "My name is Ki'ta-daro of the lands of the Khajiit, far to the south. This one has heard your challenge and wishes to put your locks to the test and to see the treasure of your promise, for Kiâ€™ta-daro is a master of unlocking and there is no lock which she has not been able to open."


But Judeth was not impressed and presented her with a basic lock, a kind which a child would guard his toys with, and asked her to open it. Then Ki'ta-daro took pick and tool and within seconds, opened the lock.


And Judeth smiled and presented her with a fine lock, a kind which merchants would guard their storerooms with, and asked her to open it. Then Ki'ta-daro took pick and tool and within minutes, opened the lock.


And Judeth was delighted, and presented her with an ornate lock, a kind which rich mer would guard their treasures with, and asked her to open it. Then Ki'ta-daro took pick and tool and within an hour, opened the lock.


And Judeth was pleased, for she knew that the Khajiit was cunning. And she said, "Truly you are a master of unlocking, for you have opened locks that no mer before has opened. But you have not yet opened my greatest lock, and beheld the treasure that is most precious to mer and men."


Then Judeth presented to Ki'ta-daro her greatest lock, and the Khajiit had seen nothing like it. It held the likeness of the world, cast from Dwemer metal, gilt with gold and edged around with silver. On the inside were inscribed the mysteries of Nirn, and on the outside were inscribed the mysteries of Aetherius, and it was beautiful to behold. And Ki'ta-daro was astonished and said, "This one is pleased to behold your creation and it will bring her even greater pleasure to open it without its key."


Then Ki'ta-daro took pick and took and was dismayed, for the lock defied her seeking pick and withstood her strong tool. And a pin she thought secure would move when she touched another. And when she turned the lock, the chest would not open, but the pins again sprung loose. And Ji'ta-daro labored a full day and a full night with pick and tool and the lock yet remained shut. Then Ki'ta-daro was sorrowful and said, "This one is most sorrowful of heart, for though she is a master of unlocking, she cannot open this lock. But grant Ki'ta-daro this: let her see you open the lock with its key and view the treasure that she cannot have." And Judeth said, "It will be done."


Then Judeth took her key and fit it in the lock. She turned it once to the right, again to the right, once to the left and again to the right. Then the pins were aligned and the lock was loosed from its place. And the chest was opened, but no treasure lie within, no piles of gold, no scrolls of knowledge, no weapons of war. And Ki'ta-daro was bewildered and said, "Where is this treasure of yours? Has this one toiled for a full day and a full night, straining away at nothing but air?"


And Judeth smiled and said, "What is more precious than air? For no mer can breathe gold. And no man can take silver into his lungs. And if he is cast into the vastness of the ocean, would he not surrender his lands and his riches to have air once more?"


Then Ki'ta-daro was wroth, for in her foolishness she had humbled herself before air and opened locks for a breath of wind. And in fury she departed from Resdayn and the Dwemer, to never return. And Judeth laughed and was delighted in her heart, for she knew that her locks were the greatest, most beautiful and most secure in the land.
