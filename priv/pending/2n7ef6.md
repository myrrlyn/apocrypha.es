Hosanna to Thou, whose name is existence unending.

Hosanna to Thou, whose name is cloak of dirt casted off.

Hosanna to Thou, whose name is divinity attained.

Hosanna to Thou, who will break the yoke of Arkay.



You hight Mannimarco, glory to Thee!



I am mere worm in your presence, crawling in the mortality. For behold, I was conceived in slavery, and in the bowels of sewers my mother beared me. Thou art the salvager, who saves my soul from sufferings innumeral. Thou hadst opened my eyes and now I see wiles of false gods and fight them. Have mercy on me, O Lord, and grant me strength to oppose Foe. For Thy gladness I spill my blood on the unholy tomes of Arkay, and with this I shalt be cleaned. For Thy grace I unearth the bones of my former clay, and with this they shalt rejoice. Let me join Thou in Thee majesty and discover un-death. For the bliss of Thy blessing I destroy the foul world and humbly await, when Thou cast me upon the
