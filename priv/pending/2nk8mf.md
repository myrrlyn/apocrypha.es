Because it's /r/teslore's 3rd anniversary and because this is the part I've written the most on (along with being the shortest) I've decided to finally put out my C0DA where I can. For a quick briefing: I will not be discussing how or when Khajiit made it to the setting; Part of Nirn is what we see in clockwork image seen in C0DA, but not the entirety of it is in this state. Just ask in comments if you need further clarification.

5E 352

Nirni is is at her weakest state. Now what was once “Dawn's Beauty” is now barely recognisable. The two moons that were formerly desolate are now the only heritage for the future.

Looking up into the sky from Jone, who is also called Secunda, there remains to be the familiar lights of Oblivion and Aetherius but are now joined by two moons - one red and the other a creamy brown – and the mechanical orb that used to be the prize of the whole world. Looking down, onto the surface of Jone, we can see what has become of the many-shaped Khajiit. Even after centuries of different political organisations, they still refuse to have one single overarching culture. Those which were the more extreme of the Ne' Quinniit continue living as nomads across the surface of Jone, though the majority still live in a number of small towns that dot the landscape. Those whom were the Pallatiit live in larger towns and cities that extend both up and down, but are more restricted by the various governments that are ruled by the Mane.

Travel between the two main moons is low and usually only done by the wealthy looking for more wealth as most scholars and artists have already discovered that Dunmeri society's hospitality has not improved over time. Dunmer travel far less than Khajiit do, usually due to the dangers of Masser's surface.

The current Mane, Ri'Salli-dad-kun-jo, is easily the smallest of the three moons but occupies himself with great tasks in the meantime. Unlike previous orbiting Manes, he allows no Khajiit to be residents within himself for periods longer than 4 weeks, or until a specific project has been completed. He spends most of his free time contemplating his future, as he desires to guarantee the safety of his people but is unsure if he can do the same for himself.

Walk-Brass, the gigantic metal construct of the Dwemer, attacks at Nirni for irregular periods, but at times has made attacks on the surfaces of the moons. Brass Walker remains a threat to the world it rejects.

Ri'Salli-dad-kun-jo has cancelled all but one project. Whilst it was mostly built by Pallatiit, he now calls upon various Ne' Quinniit tribes and temples. Several are questioning the Mane, as history shows that such a task was only left for either times of great desperation or at the will of Alkosh and neither seemed to apply. Still, many volunteered and entered the various temporary living quarters that the Mane had shaped for them.

Those that were strictly living in the Mane's clan were now given elaborate and beautiful gardens to reside in for the coming days. Whilst tradition would usually dictate that each living space was tailored to the specific guest, there were comforting and awakening symbols that he needed them to understand. The most dedicated warriors were already aware of this somewhat alien thought, but many found it best to ignore the implications for nothing more than peace of mind. The Mane's reasoning was this: “Where there is fear there is room for courage. It is neither life nor death, it is accepting fate and thus achieving ones fullest potential”.
