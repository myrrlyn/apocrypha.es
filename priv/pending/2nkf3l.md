The pair look at Anumidium constrained by a complex torture rack.

"I know why we're here, together." Di'vaad says. "You're trying to change everything over a grudge. You were made from hate, but kept yourself from salvation for becoming the hate you have for your fathers and mothers. You're just like them. I bet you dream of a world without any sign you were born at all; but that's just not going to happen. As Azurah willed, all things will pass. Your time is over, we've already eaten the Dreamer, haven't we?"

"No."

One word uttered and Bo'nett witnesses the decapitation of her best friend. The Numidium is loose and has set sights on Bo'nett. Quickly running for her life, Bo'nett races around to the back of Numidium and lights it's head aflame hot enough to already melt part of it.

"Every flame will burn out" Bo'nett cries. "Every story ends. This is the nature of the world, everything dies in the face of time; if you won't corrode, I'll melt your story away!"

Unfortunately, Anumidium punches Bo'nett into a wall of the Mane. It begins to go for a final blow until "ALKOSH! STOP THE FLOW OF TIME!"
