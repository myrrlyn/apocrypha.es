"Holy shit." Bo'nett says as she exhaustedly moves away in desperation. "I can only stop it for a few seconds, I have to shine this thing quickly!" she states as she removes a plate from Numidium's finger.

"There's just enough here to make a reflection" she states.

However, she notices up in the dark abyss of the Mane that just then, the eyes of Numidium were following her and opened its mouth. "The flow of time resumes."

Despite the terrifying power of Numidium, this does not stop her plan.

"Aha! It's a mirror! Look, jeko, look at everything you've become! Look at where the disappearance of the Dwarves led them to!" Bo'nett roars.

Contrary to the plan, Numidium doesn't care and reconnects the plate to its finger.

"Fine! Fuck all of it!"

Bo'nett runs up Numidium's arm thinking how cool that is even if she is going to die and jumps through the giant robot's mouth.

"**You're not killing me, I'm killing me, idiot!**........ ok, really now, that thing had to use the Heart right? it has to have something inside here I can take down". Bo'nett feels around inside Numidium but can't find any kind of heart. What she can feel, though, is the plates of Numidium getting smaller.

"Shit, this thing can go smaller? But... no... we're the heroes"

Numidium shrinks and Bo'nett gradually dies as her body is crushed from all directions. Bones snap and blood rushes out wherever it can.

"If it can go smaller and kill me then that means... it can go bigger".

Even with the blood still leaking out from the dead body of Bo'nett, Numidium explodes in size and rips the Mane apart. With what little life he had left he was selfishly relieved that he found where his road finished.

And the horrible fighting ended.
