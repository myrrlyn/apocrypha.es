**"Conversations with the Heart of Lorkhan" by Pelinal Whitestrake**

*â€” Ruminations on the nature of the Aurbis. Warning: Probably apocryphal.*

Shamefully I have put down sword and taken up pen.  This I have done not willingly but for duty.  Words are hard to form in this medium, better tactics have yet to [become known].  Word has come to me from Perrif that I should do this thing, and so I see it done, as her word is Law.  She asks that I record the words I share with my Missing-Mother-Maker and the songs her killers sing that pull me back from dream.

I do not choose to speak with her, except when I choose.  Her words do not make sense, after the destruction is done.  She tells me to [eat] the land, and I can not do this, so I stretch and squeeze and light turns land to void, and [text missing] told that this is good.  I remember some of her words, Perrif, and so I shall write them for you, and pray that I [be forgiven / be accepted] for this treachery of nature:

"*Tarnorinnei, varla venne* for you are a nothing that is part of I, and within all that can be, is.  *Shante ryne, fey hind-camanval*.  Fly to me and I shall make you whole and full of the buzzing lies.  Nothing is all that is everything and you are that as all things are.  One in nothingness.  Pass through and find me waiting where there is nowhere and we will fill the void together, *o poliruma* I am waiting always waiting wanting for you to put an end into it so the beginning can begin.  Now put to slaughter that reality and we shall be one when you are won and done."

When those words were inside me, I am told I turned four woods empty before I was sung to sleep.
