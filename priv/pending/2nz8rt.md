A part of my C0DA regarding the Alessian Church in Cyrodiil following the War of Righteousness, more of which will be revealed later on.

____

*Cyrodiil, 1E 2362*

The world lies broken, in a woeful way. Wars rage, blood runs in the streets and permeates the earth, there is little happiness or solace to be found here on Nirn. The skies are gray, as Mother Kynareth turns her ghostly face away from our sorrow. Stendarr himself cannot stand our decrepit sight, and the best aspiration for man and mer alike is that his righteous fire will purify the earth and end our ceaseless suffering.

Lady Dibella's beauty lays wilted and deflowered; Mara weeps for the stillborn child that is we mortals. Akatosh cannot bear to carry on the low state of his children, and Julianos himself is lost in the endless labyrinth of contradiction we have borne since the dawn of man. Zenithar shakes his head as we seek fruitlessly to find rest in the face of endless toil, and we can only hope that Arkay will greet us with the sleep of a funeral pyre when the wheel of time ceases to turn.

The struggle of mortality is a plague, indeed, but even in our wretchedness we can look to the legacy of the Aedra, who despite their great power were mortal and fallible. But in their sacrifice and limitations, they showed us how to make the most of our brief existence and how to live righteous and pious lives, graciously giving value to our footsteps on Nirn. In these times, many seek to escape the pain of day to day life, but the wise look at the legacy of our hallowed guides and see that the burden of this life is not one to be shirked and escaped. We are to do as the gods did and forge ahead through trial and tribulation, embrace the pain and sorrow, and take solace in our piety and devotion.

##### The Church of the Aedra's Death wants to guide you toward peace in the midst of the strife and hardship that is a necessary part of life.
