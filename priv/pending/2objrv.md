I grew in my hatred as an orsimer.
I became the highest over the sum of all.
You are my will shaped by your own foolishness.
You are weakness in the form of false righteousness.
My spells create the new blight.
My blade enforces my will.
My bow strikes unneringly with the certainty of truth.
My flesh is perfect and deflects every strike as my wisdom does your foolishness.
I am all you are me.
I will wield truth as I speak, and righteousness as I walk.
You will fall before me and realize your weakness.
You will be my will reforged in my hatred.
My will is the true path.
My words are the truth given voice.
My actions are righteousness enacted.
My world will bend at my whim.



I'm not the greatest scholar but I had an idea I wanted to share. Is it possible to mantle Dagoth Ur?

 I'd love to see others retell this story.
