*A text written by a Hircine cultist.*

You’ve noticed it, haven’t you? You’ve seen the tears in the Green, where the colours of a thousand different Valenwoods shine through. You’ve thought about how we can shift, why we can shift, while other Mer cannot. You’ve even thought of the truth behind the Wild Hunt. Why it happens, why it can happen, what the Words are, what the Silvenar and Green Lady know that we do not.

I implore you to think harder. To open your minds though the Spinners have taught you not to. Look past the Story, look past the words of the pretender Y’ffre, to consider what we were before she shackled us. Her Story was told to force us into unnatural submission. What was the Chaos? What are the Bosmer? What is Valenwood? What is the Wild Hunt?

The answers are right in front of you. They always were.

We are the children of Hircine. The Valenwood is a splinter of our true home, His glorious Hunting Grounds. A place reshaped, repurposed, all to suit the whims of the imposter Y’ffre. Y’ffre sought to make us forget, she wished to take His realm and His children to make her own.

But we can remember. We can see past the unnatural Order forced upon this realm. We can see Hircine’s colours bleed through the trees. A beast lies dormant inside each of us, waiting for our realization. Why else can we take the form of beasts? Why else would our leaders hide so much of the Wild Hunt? Because it is a gift of Hircine, our Maker, our Father.

He comes for us in our hour of need, as He always will, as He loves us more than Y’ffre ever could. He seeks to free us from our bondage, to take back what is rightfully His. But He can only go so far, only do so much. We must aid Him so that we can return to the blissful chaos of Oblivion.

Hunt with us now so we may return to His side and know once more what it means to be free!
