Excerpts from the sermons of High Priest Alabor of High Rock.

My countrymen, you have suffered greatly. We the Bretons have healed the fallen, we've remained in the empire. Regardless of how you feel about the many wars that ravage the empire, I beg of you, turn to our gods. The Eleven Breton gods guide and protect High Rock. For it is through them that the Breton race is defined. I know that we all walk in a different direction, and thankfully, the gods have a lesson for all.

Akatosh; the cleansed God, he who is neither Nordic nor elven. He is the binding favor that keeps our pantheon strong. Akatosh commands that we remain in the empire, and we shall.

Arkay; the god with many stories. Some would say that he is Malacath, I say different. Auri'el blessed a mortal mer to replace triminac, and to teach mer and man of life and death.

Dibella; the beautiful Nordic goddess. She teaches us to cherish creation and to keep ourselves kempt.

Julianos; the god of wisdom, who was also a God of man. He is the great teacher of our race.

Kynareth; another Nordic goddess, she who is wind and storm. The patron of travelers and adventurers looks fondly on us all.

Magnus; an elven god, the sculptor of the sun, the magica gifter. He who was blinded. Magnus gave us the power to will healing and fire.

Mara; the mother goddess worshipped by both man and mer. It is through her love and compassion that we learned to love each other.

Phynaster; the hero god of Summerset, he taught the aldmer, our cousins, to live a longer life.

Stendarr; the Nordic god of mercy, his vigilants protect us from the horrors of oblivion

Y'ffre; the elven storyteller. He guides our cousins in Valenwood, and one of the first to crystallize and become earhtbones.

Zenithar; the Nordic God of commerce. He teaches us to be strong on our own accord.

There are those among you who would still worship Talos, and consider his lacking in our pantheon a mockery. Take heed, for before Talos was worshipped as a god, he was a breton. 

Man and mer will fight, but it's vital that you all stay strong, and worship the gods of High Rock. We the Bretons are proof that man and mer can live in peace, it is in our blood, in our hearts, and in our gods.
