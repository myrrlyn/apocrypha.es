"Me? Well I don't really know where to start"

"You stand up just over my elbow but your muscles look bigger than mine, start with that" Halir responds.

"Oh. Thanks, I just really enjoy improving my body, but I also don't eat as poorly as others which might be what really helps. In fact, that's what lead to my studies. Only two months ago I finished studying agriculture and horticulture. Everything needs a balance, you know? And I figured if I'm going to be strong in the body I've gotta be strong in the mind too. Plus, why not learn about food? You're always going to need knowledge about food - and if you don't have the food to use the knowledge then you've got bigger problems. You can look at my degree if you want. Here: 'Tivashi has completed the study of Agriculture and Horticulture with high distinction'. I had to write a ton of words just on farming and pest prevention, it's pretty weird huh?"

"I guess so. They don't teach you any magic at your colleges here?"

"What? Of course they do, why wouldn't they?"

"It's nothing, I just thought they'd be more like ours. Higher education back home usually either has to do with magic or the Temple"

"We'd only learn things like that if it was useful, like setting up magic barriers around easily damaged crops; but you have to be careful with that or you can die."

"Ok. Anything else to tell, like that hairstyle there?"

"What are you trying to say about my hair?"

"what?"

"Are you talking shit about my hair?"

"wha- No! It's just... I've never seen anything like that before"

"It's a good hairstyle."

"I'm not saying against it, man"

"Good. It takes a while to shape but it's always worth it. Plus since it's kept down so well it's rarely a bother afterwards. How do you do yours?"

"I just wake up and throw it to the side."

"oh"

"yeah"

"easy"

"yeah"

"..."

"...So how about Old Gold over here?"
