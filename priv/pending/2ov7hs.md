#*Somebody suggested I start writing, and a while ago I noted this as an interesting unexplored facet of lore. So here it is. This is a bit out of the ordinary for TESLore.*

…

The Queen Mother denied my request to move the Prince again this morning. The solar is not well equipped for medical supervision, and the windows make it difficult to keep warm. She was not forthcoming about her reasoning, but I suspect she thinks he should have a view of home. I haven't the heart to tell her the child will probably never wake again.

…

My old mentor, Dr. — suggested I summarize the history of the Prince's condition to solidify the details in my mind and ensure I haven't overlooked anything.

So.

He was in good health with no notable medical conditions until the uprising of —, when the family was forced to flee the surface. They stayed with the Queen Mother's uncle in the Jovian moons for three years. During this time, he was in good physiological health, though obviously sustained some psychological trauma and exhibited moderate anxiety and depression, and hints of agoraphobia, which were treated with counseling. He seemed in good health when the family undertook the return trip to Phobos following the collapse of the insurrection and return of the royal families, but mid-trip—under acceleration, shortly after turnover if that's relevant, he fell into a deep coma in the midst of one sleep cycle. We noticed when he failed to wake the following morning. I attempted the standard suite of treatments as we approached landing, but none were effective. Once we'd landed and he'd been installed in the solar, the Queen Mother refused to move him, so he's been monitored and sporadically, experimentally treated for the past year.

I see nothing in this to suggest a cause. This is not enough detail. I will go over it again more closely…

…

*Something* in the child's mind has awoken. The monitoring systems woke me early this morning with reports of consciousness, and I rushed in excitedly, but he was as unconscious as ever. But the instruments are *reporting* conscious activity in his brain. I don't know what to make of this. All evidence indicates he's not locked in—the scans look more like he's *dreaming*. To my knowledge, this is unprecedented.

…

The Prince had another subconscious awakening this morning. I got the Queen Mother's agreement to try the new dreamsharing techniques pioneered by —, but the results were inconclusive. I am unsure if I am simply too unskilled an operator or if there's something in the child's state to make it unsuitable. (Use on patients in a coma is unprecedented, after all. Usually they don't dream.) I have gotten in contact with the researchers at — to confer, but in the meantime, we're back to watching and waiting, as we have for years now.

The things I saw in the child's mind were fantastic, but — has warned me that this is typical of dreams…
