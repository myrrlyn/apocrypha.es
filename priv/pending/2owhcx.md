*Drem Yol Lok, Greetings Dovahkiin, what brings you back to my Strunmah?* 

For meditation, but on new Words of Power. I feel I’ve learned much about Fus, Feim and Yol. Surely there is more I can learn, will you not instruct me on the others?

*Unslaad Yah, you wish to learn about the thu’um than what I have already taught you? You strike at my weakness for Tinvaak. Dahmann, that learning a word requires taking the meaning into yourself, and letting it become one with you inner spirit. Very well, what word calls to you Dovahkiin?*

Raan.

*The word means “Animal” in your tongue. Remember that the beasts of the land are creations of Kaan, Kyne, and honor them as such. Also, think of your inner beast Dovahkiin, the primal instincts that allow you fight and survive. Recall the strength such base suleyk, power, gives you. That is the meaning of Raan. Let your inner animal guide those that you call upon to aid. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that the beasts of the land will serve you longer.*
