*Greetings Dovahkiin, you have returned seeking, Onikaan, wisdom hmmm? What word calls to you?*

What can you tell me about Laas?

*Life is the meaning in your tongue. Ponder this, life is energy, life is change. As you call out with your zul remember that life does not Ofan Unslaad. Life does not begat stasis, seek out these subtle changes in each individual. Laas Myez Oblaan, all life will end but returns as something new. This is the meaning of Laas. Life is Nahlass, and in constant transformation. Learn to discern the difference between the Rii, essence, of each life. You will find that you can detect even the most remote lifespark.*
