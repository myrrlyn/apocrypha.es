Paarthurnax, greetings. I have come seeking your insight on another Word of Power.

*Drem Yol Lok, Dovahkiin. Which Rotmulaag is calling to you?*

Lok

*A clever Morah, it means “Sky” in your tongue. The dov have more of an affinity for this word that the joorre. The skies of Kiezaal have always been our domain for ages. The dovah invoke it in our ancient greetings as a gesture of peace, that both our actions and travel would be so. You have a special relation with the sky as well Dovahkiin, think of it as a place of testing. To calm the very Su, Air, you must be at peace within yourself. As you call upon Va and Koor, spring and summer, bring yourself to peace and calm. That is the meaning of Lok. The skies are simply means for you to exercise your patience and Inhus, mastery of the thu’um. You will find that you can calm the skies for even longer.*
