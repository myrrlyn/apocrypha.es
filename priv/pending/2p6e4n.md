*Drem Yol Lok, Dovahkiin, Daal Siiv Onikaan Rotmulaag? What word are you seeking?*

What can you tell me about the word, Zun?

*“Weapon” in your tongue. It was created by the dovah to be used against the joor during the Dragon War. Before Bron, Nords were taught the voice, they had no match against the thu’um. Yet they would still meet us upon the Frod, field of battle, with their Zun, axes and swords. The dovah could easily rout them after using this thu’um. Consider this Dovahkiin, how reliant are you upon your own Zun? How reliant, the enemy upon theirs? Strike at their weakness of being disarmed, the fear of being unable to defend oneself. Focus yourself on the mastery of the thu’um, a weapon that none may take from you. This is the meaning of Zun. To use your Voice as an innate weapon, to advance conflict, or avoid it? Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that none will stand untouched by your thu’um.*
