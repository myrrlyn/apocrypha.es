*Truly you are a Wunduniik, what would would you ask of me Dovahkiin, which word do you seek?*

What understanding do you have of Faas?

*It is called “Fear” in your tongue. One of the most ancient of the Rotmulaags, for fear is something that every being feels. What do you fear Dovahkiin? Faaz, Dinok, Funta? Pain, death or failure? Before you can exploit the Faas of others, you must first confront your own. You are dovah in Ziil, soul, ply the inborn ability to Rel, dominate and turn it against your inner most fears. Once you have dominated and Zind over your fears, you can exploit those of others. What do the joore fear, the dovah? That is the meaning of Faas, to command ones fears and expoloit those of others and drive them to Maar, terror. Su’um ahrk morah Dovahkiin. You will find that all will flee before your thu’um.*
