Greetings Paarthurnax, I have returned seeking your Onikaan, will you help me?

*Hmm, you humor me with the dovah speech. What word is calling you to Dovahkiin, what do you seek?*

Tell me about Su

*“Air” in your tongue. The dovah are not just master of the thu’um, we hold Inhus, mastery of the skies, forces of Hevno Fus, brutal physical force. When the Su’um runs out the dovah would turn to their claws and talons to rend flesh and stone. To Grah, battle, in the air requires grace and precision of Hadrim and Kopraan. How this applies to you is different Dovahkiin, the joore as well. Your limbs can also strike like the wind and allow you to fight upon the ground as the dovah do in the skies. Recall Fus, and how it can be applied effortlessly, think of how you may move through the air without hindrance. That is the meaning of “Su” To move as the wind does, without pause or restraint. Su’um ahrk morah. The air will give way to your force.*
