Through the Forest we go,

Traveling to and fro!


Great adventures await us,

no halls can contain us,

our lust is o' so contagious!


Our journeys are bold.

through the Forests of old,

we will return with stories yearning to be told,

filled with us and our glories!

You are welcome to join us,

tag along, we don't mind

as long as you don't fall behind!

We will laugh and will sing as we travel along

to tunes such as this song!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This traveling song of the Bosmer is usually followed with hearty laughter and a stop for a swig of the flask and a puff on the pipe as the elves go about their journeys.
