*Drem Yol Lok Dovahkiin, you return once again. Are you here for Tinvaak or would you seek a Rotmulaag first?*

I’d like to know more about Fo

*It means “Frost” in your tongue. It is a resisting to change. Just as Yol is change at its most primal, Fo is the suleyk, power, to blunt and inhibit change. Think of the Krah of Keizaal, how it can debilitate and fatigue, weaken the Fen, will, to the point of Viik. Drive them to the point of defeat through natural causes. A healthy and vigorous Kopraan is so often taken for granted among warriors. That is the true meaning of “Fo.” The power to weaken and hinder change. Su’um ahrk morah. What will you leave to its forsake, what will you save?*
