Drem Yol Lok, Paarthurnax, I think you know why I am here.

*You continue to humor Dovahkiin, you will learn the dov speech yet, what word is calling to you?*

Iiz

*It means “Ice” in your tongue. The Rotmulaag itself is closely related to Fo, but carries a different meaning. Where Fo inhibits change, Iiz ceases it. The thu’um itself also arose from the Dragon War. Slen, Flesh is not a part of this thu’um unintentionally, it was purpose made to Grah Faal Bron, fight the Nords who rebelled against the Dragon Cult. Beyond being a weapon, the thu’um expresses a deeper idea. The suleyk, power, to stop the changes that occurs due to the Vennesetiid, is one of immense Mulaag. You tamper and manipulate the natural processes for yourself. That is the meaning of “Iiz.” To Diin, freeze, those you in the stream of time. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that joore remain entombed for Unslaad Tiid.*
