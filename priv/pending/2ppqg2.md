*Greetings Dovahkiin, you will Mindok Onikaan, know all the knowledge to carry you for the rest of the age if you continue to seek out the Rotmulaags. Your thu’um is becoming strong. What word would I teach you today*.

Can you teach me about Kaan?

*“Kyne” in the tounge of the Bron, Nords. Kiir Akatosh the dovah are, Bromah he is to us. Yet we also recognize the other Rah Wahlaan, Kyne is one of them. Nord legends sing that it was her Ven that came to me and called upon me to teach men the thu’um. Of that I will say no more. The thu’um itself is much like Raan, only that it calms the beasts of the land, recall that they are all Kaan’s creations. To sooth them you must be at Drem yourself.  To be calm and at peace, to realize that you are speaking in True Need. That is the meaning of “Kaan.” To be at peace with nature and all of her creations. You will find that the beasts touched by your thu’um will Unslaad Ov Hi.*
