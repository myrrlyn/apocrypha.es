Lady gra-Kragog, 

I did exactly as you instructed in your last letter but I'm not entirely sure where I'm going wrong... I reconstructed the scroll piece-by-piece, but it just keeps failing-- the barrier collapses in seconds! Are you sure you did it right? I dunno if it's good... 

Anyway thanks for getting back to me so quick! I definitely wanna go to the university and get out of this dingy castle! When would I start (and would I have to take barrier classes)? Not to sound hasty but I'm pretty sure I'm doing a good job. I was even told by His Highness himself that I'd be reprimanded if I kept producing similar results, which is a good thing right? I also decided to take your advice and stop eating over my stuff when I write you, it's super messy. Hope I can get some details,


See you at orientation!
