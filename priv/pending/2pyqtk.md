*A practical guide to Tamrielic alchemy based on my own knowledge and practice of traditional, real-world alchemy. As told by a character of mine, Balus gro-???? Will have multiple parts/chapters.*

**Introduction** 
 
What is Alchemy? This is the most vital question you must ask yourself once you've decided to take up its study. This guide can help to answer this question but all careless browsing and lack of focus will lead to nothing, and will ultimately be your downfall. However if the student has sufficient interest in not only the alchemical process, but also in magic, herbology, and the general study of Nirn and the greater Mundus, then their questions shall be answered through extensive experience. So what is alchemy? It is the harnessing of the power inherent in our world, through the raising of vibrations. 

As any proper student of alchemy is aware, the exact process by which these energies are enhanced is not written down in any concrete form, as is general practice and tradition amongst alchemical scholars. But written in this guide will be the key to navigating the lesser circulations of the alchemical process. There are two lower circulations, though with their own hierarchies within the system. 

* The first is the Positive, lesser Kingdom: the common herbs and other plants you will be using in your practice. 
* The second is the Negative, higher Kingdom, which includes salts (both natural and ethereal) and other minerals. 

Grueling practice within the positive, herbal, kingdom will be your gateway into the higher kingdoms, and will ultimately be your novice's tool of choice. It is the strict followings of these kingdoms that grants out spagyric art the intensity and longevity it's had thus far. 

If the student cannot accept that they will be tested, kindled and reborn just as the tools they work with, they will never be successful in their practice. Alchemy in and of itself is like a religion, and must be followed as such. There is no room in alchemy for greed, or idleness, and like any profession must be given a certain degree of respect. If the student following this guide believes they can adhere to these rules (accepting that alchemy is a life-long practice) then they will ultimately be successful, regardless of continuation of this guide or the skill of their master. 

I do not write to speak over allopathic healers, over restorative magics-- nor do I write to insist that alchemy is the true triumph over either. But instead I hope to instill in you, the student, the ideals that I have come to take to heart through my practice, and to teach that alchemy can cover all of these basic topics, as well as more in-depth versions of their practical applications.  

However you must be forwarned: If you've come for vainglory, to turn lead into Septims, then you will fail.
