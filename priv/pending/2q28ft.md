&gt; Atmora to the North is frozen in time. As such, it didn't really exist at all.

I suppose Tamriel is the center of time because here there is Ada-Mantia.
So, since the separation of Atmora from Tamriel, Atmora is frozen in time. Ok! But what does it exactly mean?

MK said:

&gt; And how horrible it must have been to be driven from Skyrim back to the place of where time did not move but you somehow did.

&gt; An inversion of Aldmeris.

&gt; But where Aldmeris was a "good" place to some of the spirits made flesh, Atmora was more of a return to the grossness of no utility.

Ok! So Atmora is a land without time. All is always the same. Frozen. No seasons. No climatic changes.

&gt; Think about a frozen land without using:

&gt; Ice/Snow/Frost/Wind

&gt; Then you'll have a cool Atmora mod.

I want to say ["permafrost"](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Permafrost_stone-rings_hg.jpg). Ok! But in Atmora, there is [Faldrosta the great Snow-Gnoose](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/onus-oghma). And if we consider the [Song of Hrormir](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/song-hrormir) as taking place in Atmora, there is the kingdom of Evensnow in Atmora. According the [PGE3](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-third-edition-atmora) (where it's written there is Tamrielic expeditions to Atmora in the Third Era), there are "frost", "permanent winter". Finally, in [this picture](http://www.imperial-library.info/sites/default/files/obscure_talos-king-atmora.jpg), MK himself shows snow on the ground, frost in the breath of the caracters. 

As a result, yes, there are ice, snow, frost, wind in Atmora! Atmora is [that](http://41.media.tumblr.com/a75928d1c7b3fc4a4f730a11dd5224c5/tumblr_mq73aoItsI1rml4zno1_1280.jpg)!

But I accept Atmora frozen in time. However, [PGE3](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-third-edition-atmora) said:

&gt; The description of the land these raiders had left changes radically over the years, leaving many to believe that it was gradually dying, smothered by frost.

It can be contrary to the MK's quotes. But no, because I think the Atmoran climat didn't go to something new, but went back to the normal state: frozen in time (with frost and snow!). Indeed, Dragons are not normal magical animals. They are time-machines, which eat the time. I believe they can make go forwards the time, or backwards. More the Dragons are powerful and numerous, more they can make go forwards the time. 

During the most of the Merethic Era, Atmora was enough temperate for the life thanks the Dragons. That's why the Dragon Cult was so important in Atmora. But in the late Merethic, Ysgramor went to Tamriel, followed by many Atmorans. Among them, there were numerous Dragons. So there were less and less time-machines in Atmora, and gradually the continent became colder.

When the last important Dragon in Atmora, Ysmir the Dragon of the North left Atmora to join Tamriel, it was the end for Atmora. When Hans the Fox, aka Pelinal Whitestrake, aka Ysmir the Dragon of the North, left Atmora in the last years of the Merethic Era, forcing the escape of a few Atmorans in 1E 68. When Wulfharth of Atmora, aka the Dragon of the North, left the Merethic Era in the First Era, explaining the fact that Vivec and Nerevar saw only ["frozen bearded kings"](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-seventeen). When Talos of Atmora, aka Ysmir the Dragon of the North, left Atmora in the late Second Era, explaining the fact that the Tamrielic expeditions found no life in Atmora in the Third Era. They were the last time-machines of Atmora.

This also explains why the Dragon Cult became tyranical in Tamriel. The Dragon Cult must think the Men would rebel because their Dragonic lords are useless in Tamriel. There is Ada-Manta and, thanks that, Tamriel is always in the present! When Men rebeled in the Dragon War, Tamriel wasn't becoming a frozen land. So the Dragons were became useless rulers in this continent. The rebellion of Men was impossible in Atmora since Dragons were the things which enable life.

So that's what I think about Atmora, and what I put in my C0DA!
