*This is a record of a conversation that never took place. The Order has therefore declared it part of the Apocrypha. All who read this will be stoned, yes, even the censor who writes this must be stoned.*

It might have happened one day in a year that perhaps took place. Aka was trying to be all things to all mer and all man but could not, for the prayers burned his brain in contradiction and the petitions grew ever more. And his love for his brother Lork kept returning no matter how much he wished it gone, for he heard the words of his prisoner-jailers.

And he heard one woman, Al-Esh, more than all the others. He had no choice but to give into her, because she had faith and love. Such was his love for her that he torn into himself and bled dragon-blood upon her, as he had upon the Nords long before. She carved out another land of men and declared her people free, thus taking the reigns of the world.

But Aka still could not think straight, mad with love and hate. And so when she died, he asked his bride, "I need you to find an enemy and make him your friend. Have him see me for what I am to you."

"But you are the only God for me, though I know there are many."

"Then let him hear that. For I need exclusive devotion. I must be Tosh, that is, One. One heart. One mind. One faith. One love. One Tosh. Tosh is the word that must be written in blood, for only blood is serious and faithful and true."

Thus did the lady speak to her prophet Marukh and thus did his followers heal Aka by breaking him. They did this Once and for all time.

The last word is the word they shouted Once, TOSH.
