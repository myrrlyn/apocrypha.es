*Drem Yol Lok, Dovahkiin, Greetings. You return once again to the Monahven, no doubt for meditation. You are becoming strong in the thu’um, what word calls to you?*

You told me once that the dovah are uniquely attuned to time, what can you tell me about Tiid?

*As you said, it means “Time” in your tongue. The dovah are Kiir Ko Tiid, children of time itself. We have a...Lingrah Mindok, a deep understanding of time, its tides, and shifts. You have the ability to understand it in the same way Dovahkiin, you are dovah in Sil. Understanding Tiid is to grasp all of its facets, how time passes before us, and yet we are all part of the Veenesetid. Think of this when you call upon your thu’um, as you invoke time, who sees it pass faster, and who sees it slow to a halt? You can manipulate to you will Dovahkiin, comprehend your place in the fabric of time, where our father Akatosh placed us. That is the meaning of “Tiid.” To understand that time is malleable and that you as dovah have a Heyv, duty in the Veenesetid. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that can bring time to a standstill for those around you.*
