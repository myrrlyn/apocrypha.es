The Ninth Ghost Choir multivox warframe has been (or will be) performing post-temporal rescue operations for centuries, in a relativistic sense. Due to - or perhaps, to the benefit of - slipped dreamstrand mispairing it has developed nine distinct personalities, each of which has been assigned a unique name during operations. Those names are:

1. **Captain Starkweather**, a man whom fate has made indestructible.
1. **Cat**, who is selfish and cunning like the shadows of the moons.
1. **The Duke**.  Great loyalty is owed to the betrayer.
1. **Copper**, the scorpion.  Her symbol is the Ankh, for hers is the realm of alternation.
1. **Reinholdt**, who can and must profit from all things.
1. **Mira**.  Being formless, she takes all forms.
1. **Nuttergun**, the hyper-kinetic bullet-shape.
1. **Kohl**, he who holds the red key to the burning mansion.
1. And finally: his name's Satisfaction.  **John Satisfaction**.
