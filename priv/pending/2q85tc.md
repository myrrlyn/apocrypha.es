Greetings Paarthurnax, mentor. I’ve come to meditate on a new word of power. 

*Drem Yol Lok Dovahkiin. You are one of the most attentive students I have consuled in all the ages, what word calls to you?*

Can you teach me about Strun?

*“Storm” in your tongue. You, Dovahkiin, have a special relation with this thu’um. The Greybeards have greeted you as Ysmir, Dragon of the North. With that the title of Strundu’ual, Stormcrown. You have taken up this mantle for yourself and this thu’um will allow you to harken to it. Like Talos before a Strun will be at your call, aiding you in Grah. You call upon Kaan’s realm when you use this thu’um, she is the Goddess of the Storm, honor her as such and the Lok Fen Nah Gaah. Know this Dovahkiin, the storm and Kiezaal are deeply rooted together. Recognize the connection Strundu’ual. That is the meaning of “Strun.” To become one with your inner self, and mantle that which came before. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that the storm will last as long as you will it.*
