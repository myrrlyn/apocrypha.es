*Yermum Crayterua, Maormeri Scholar of All Profane Utterances, collected for his most illustrious majesty Orgnum*

Lions, cat men and battlecats, oh my! Elsweyr. Comically mysterious and exotically pungent land of the furball-hacking cat men. It's very name is a semi-amusing piece of wordplay. My curse-ridden quest across this continent of sailor mouths has brought me here, to this sanitarily questionable province of, shall we say, exotic apothecaries (drug dealers my Maormeri friends, drug dealers) and feline masters of larceny. What nebulous nuggets of profane parlance will grace the ears and pages of our magnanimous Maormeri magisters in this venerable volume of my book? Make like our northern neighbors and turn your little cranial moons to my cuss-filled pages to find out!

The Khajiiti array of verbal barbs of course have roots in their ancient culture, but many things that might be frowned upon in other lands do not phase the cat men. I could not,  for example, in my extensive research find a frequently used insult for being a criminal, at least in the way that other cultures have. The Khajiit have their own set of values, and their own vulgar vocabulary to match. Let this tome expand your mind, without the skooma!

**ELSWEYR**

"Cold slate"

Many well-travelled mortals have had the opportunity to meet and even do business with the innumerable Khajiiti merchant caravans spread across Tamriel, and as such, have likely heard the ubiquitous Elsweyri expression "Warm sands". This is a compliment, a well-wishing emotion, hoping the other party finds good fortune, happiness, and maybe even literal warm sands. What most foreigners do not know is that an opposite to this phrase exists in the Khajiiti vernacular, that being "cold slate". It has the reverse sentiment attached to it, saying that the insulter hopes the insulted has a terrible day, bad luck, and as unappealing a life as possible. Customers of their caravans wouldn't know it, but most caravan Khajiit will hatefully mutter these two words to themselves as soon as their greedy foreign patrons are gone, spiteful as cats can be.

"Va'Aneqasa/Va'Pellidosa"

These two vicious slurs have been included together, because of their linked meanings and effect. Their derivation is political, being derogatory terms for the peoples of either Khajiiti nation. Words that could be associated with the former are barbarian, luddite, trash, bum, and many more such terms for one of low class, ill manners, and regrettably small intelligence. These are all things long associated with Anequina, the northern nation of Elsweyr, and as such the first word here is frequently used by outspoken Pellitini. The latter of these insults is the reverse, used by Anequinians to deride their southern brothers. It more or less could be interchangeable with words like posh, uppity, fat, rich, obnoxious, arrogant, or myriad other similar words for those of great monetary richness, but little of character.

"K'sharraj"

Derived from an ancient Khajiiti prophecy in which a series of un-fur-tunate events culminating in a rain of flaming dogs will plague an unlucky village of Khajiit, this word applies to one with bad luck, or one who has really "dug themselves into a hole" to use an apt Redguard expression. It is also used as a rude curse, as though one is wishing the K'sharra prophecy on the insulted party.

"Draj"

There is little more offensive an insult in Elsweyr than this single syllable. It's direct translation is "slave", an obviously sore subject among the Khajiit. To have been made a slave in ages past was the greatest dishonour and shame imaginable, and even since it's outlawing in Morrowind hundreds of years ago, the revulsion to slavery is still deeply etched into the Khajiiti psyche. It can also be used to call someone weak-willed, docile, or meek, but it is not to be used lightly, unless one fancies themselves an Anequinian scratching post.

"Renrij"

Translates to scum. Derivation traced to Pellitine, first used in the Second Era to describe the inhabitants of Torval's Dirt Slurper district.

"Sugartail"

Means "clumsy thief". Presumably, a clumsy thief would get their tail in a bowl of the region's famous moon sugar, and this unique presumption forms the basis of the insult. In the Starry Heart's heart of thievery, this can be quite the blemish one one's reputation. Outside of clandestine operations, it can be used to denote oafish or incompetent people.

"Dustface"

Similar to the Cyro-Nordic term "do-gooder", used to describe a fair, generous, rule-following, upstanding person. It bears mention that there isn't even a word in Ta'Agra for "rules". Khajiit actually *value* thievery, praising expert thieves, and ridiculing law-abiding citizens. They have more "heroes" who cut purses than those who cut down fearsome enemies. Truly, the complete disregard the Khajiit have for the law is baffling, considering their civilization has survived for thousands of years. The derivation of this cutting remark stretches back into ancient Khajiiti myth, and the only true source I could find was from a nomadic Khajiiti Clan Mother. This cultural affinity for kleptomania is clearly no new part of the Khajiiti identity.

"Sheggo"

A shortened form of the Ta'Agra word for the Mad God, it's a cruel term for one lacking in mental stability, as a result of a mental illness, old age, or excessive (and that's saying something in Elsweyr) drug use. Drug users themselves are almost never looked down upon, but junkies certainly are, and occupy the same cultural niche as anywhere, with the same stigmas and disdain too.

Now for a delightful cat-fight (of words, that is) to show these masterful mockeries in action:

"*S'Rizza! S'Rizza! You Va'Aneqasa renrij! Khajiit knows you stole her '67 Senchal vintage! Give it back before Khajiit calls the guards!*"

&lt;BURP&gt;"*Oh, S'Borro, Khajiit had hoped she would not have to see this Va'Pellidosa while she was eating and drinking, not easy on the stomach. Excellent moon sugar, va ba...don't be a dustface about it S' Borro, the damage is done.*"

"*A million moons S'Rizza! Khajiit should've expected this from a K'sharraj like you, never worked a day in her life! You're a sugartail Sheggo too, now, because of your laughable thieving, Khajiit's father will have you mugged by the Corinthe Clawfacers gang. Desert scum like you should stick to your bootleg moon sugar...stay away from those of real class, and their cabinets!*"

"*Is Khajiit supposed to be scared? Is this the same father who has S'Borro's ears scratched, and tail groomed? Draj like all you Va'Pellidosa can't even deal with an honest thief yourself. May you find cold slate beneath your feet, and chains around your ankles, to match your charming personality. (Spits)

(Before a cat-fight could break out, both Khajiiti ladies discovered they had been pickpocketed, and had to follow the overpowering stench of a group of thieves across the rooftops. Yermum himself was also robbed.)

Ah, the cat folk have a way with words, don't they? A most fortuitous foray into the juicy jungles and desolate deserts of Elsweyr. An amazing assemblage of unmatched unpleasantry of the feline sort.

As an author's note, and personal message to you, my friends at the Pyandonean Academic Society, I have received a message from the court of Orgnum, revealing the purpose of my mission; he seeks to learn all he can of Tamrielic curses so that in an  invasion, planned next year, our fleets may mouth off at the continentals in their own fashion, to offend and intimidate them! A brilliant plan! This one *will* work, I just know it!

Yours in rudeness, Yermum Crayterua

Orgnum Prevails!
