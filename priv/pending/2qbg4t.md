Diary of an AEmancer, in orbit along side a bright asteroid.

As we approached the asteroid I could feel a huge magical effort placed upon the area, emanating from the black dot. Once we got close the orc captain took his men and landed on the thing, the Lord Cynric and Lady Oratori accompanied them. It was a Vessel, made of pure varla stone, a Magne-Ge evacuation shuttle, derelict in the waters between Nirn and their Pantheon. I noticed a spirit on board and willed it forth, a lesser Magne-Ge Observation Spirit, and I bade it show me what it had seen all these years.

It gave me a vision, of shuttles flying into Oblivion, of the Elhnofey wars, faught in the Blacken Waters, of nine mighty stations with a million million swarming Spirit Fighters, firing upon each other, and at the center a tenth, with an infernal machine, eating any who strayed too close, using their meanings to construct a reality, to separate all from the Aetherius, to rest the Blackened Sea into a calm void. And it projected a force field that kept the fighting contained. And suddenly a great light burst forth, a tear, and the vessel the spirit was on lurched and the Magne-Ge on board shouted for joy. Suddenly a spear shot from one of the immense Planes and it struck the Center, and the attentions of all the fighters turned towards it, and eight flag ships descended, and after a time one of the planes ruptured, and an explosion tore it in twain, and the Machine lurched, and torn everything into it, and the sea grew calm, and the fighting stopped, the Planes became barren spheres, and the Magne-Ge piloting cursed. The Magne-Ge turned towards the Observation Spirit and asked for how many Magne-Ge didn’t reach Aetherius. 

“40,000,” the Spirit replied. 

“And how many still live.” 

“One.”

“What became of their vessels.”

“Most were hit in the crossfire, or collided, all have broken apart. They will orbit Nirn, occasionally raining upon her.”

Then a lurch and the ship stopped it’s forward march, the Magne-Ge sat on that ship for quite a time, slowly driven mad, all she could see was the brightness of the hull, and she thought herself the queen of light, the queen of whimsy, and of glamor. And one day the Spirit of Observation no longer recognized her as a Magne-Ge, but as a spirit bearing the mantle of Meridia, and so the Magne-Ge departed the vessel, into the Waters of Oblivion, to become the Prince she fancied herself as.  The Spirit observed, for some time, the movements of the bodies around this battlefield called Mundus, before a vessel approached and I drug it from its body, to commune with me.

We depart from the Mortal plane tomorrow. Good luck to us.
