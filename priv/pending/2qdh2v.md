&gt;[1:02] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; AZURA DAMMIT ANI

&gt;[1:03] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; BLACKREST, SORRY

&gt;[1:03] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO USE OUR REAL NAMES. YOU'RE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE USING THIS.

&gt;[1:03] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; UGH, WHATEVER. IT'S SAVED ON THE LOGS ALREADY.

&gt;[1:03] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; SO, DO YOU HAVE IT?

&gt;[1:05] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; the plans? 

&gt;[1:05] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; yeah i have them

&gt;[1:06] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; dammit, i have no idea why that idiot septim ever thought this was a good idea. 

&gt;[1:06] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; an "offensive battlespire"?

&gt;[1:07] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; all because of akavir?

&gt;[1:10] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; ARE YOU DRINKING THE IMPERIAL PISS AGAIN?
 
&gt;[1:10] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; THAT WASN'T THE REAL REASON. THE EMPIRE WANTED TO DETER FURTHER INVASIONS FROM OBLIVION.

&gt;[1:10] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; THE DRAGONFIRES WEREN'T QUITE CUTTING IT, SEE. 

&gt;[1:10] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; SHOCKINGLY ENOUGH, A SYSTEM THAT DEPENDS ON CYRODIIL'S POLITICAL STABILITY TENDS TO FAIL A LOT!

&gt;[1:12] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; anyway, yeah, i have it.

&gt;[1:12] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; i'll be en route to skyrim by tomorrow. shouldn't be too hard.

&gt;[1:13] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; GOOD. VEHK KNOWS WE CAN'T LET THE DOMINION HAVE THEIR HANDS ON THIS THING.

&gt;[1:13] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; what about the agent stationed there?

&gt;[1:13] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; ANCANO?

&gt;[1:14] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; LEAVE ANCANO TO ME. THAT IDIOT'S MOTIVES ARE SO TRANSPARENT THAT A NORD COULD SEE THROUGH THEM.

&gt;[1:15] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; IT'S SAFER HERE THAN IT IS IN THE IMPERIAL "CRAWLING WITH THALMOR" CITY, AT ANY RATE.

&gt;[1:15] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; I THINK HE GOT TO OUR FRIEND IN THE MIDDEN ALREADY, THOUGH. I'VE GOT TO

&gt;Critical Error!

&gt;We're sorry, but the Dreamsleeve is currently undergoing heavy liminal turbulence. This channel will refresh to your last saved settings once services become available again.

&gt;\&gt;*Cyrynyl Garann has joined #winterhold*

&gt;\&gt;*Eadwyre Blackrest has joined #winterhold*

&gt;[1:32] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; ...

&gt;[1:23] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; THAT'S NOT GOOD.

&gt;[1:12] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; what the fuck? what the fuck just happened?

&gt;[1:15] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; ANILIUS.

&gt;[1:23] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; WARP IN THE WEST. OBLIVION CRISIS. VOID NIGHTS.

&gt;[1:41] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; THOSE NAMES MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

&gt;[1:26] &lt;Eadwyre Blackrest&gt; yes.

&gt;[1:55] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; OKAY.

&gt;[1:02] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; LONG STORY SHORT: IT TAKES A FUCKING LOT TO FUCK UP THE DREAMSLEEVE.

&gt;[1:39] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; WHICH MEANS SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT WAS BIG ENOUGH TO DO SO. SOMETHING LIKE THOSE THREE.

&gt;[1:50] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; SERIOUSLY. THIS SHIT'S OF COSMIC PROPORTIONS NOW.

&gt;[1:30] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; AND WHATEVER JUST HAPPENED, IT CAN'T BE GOOD FOR TAMRIEL. 

&gt;[1:59] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; SEE, EVEN THE TIMESTAMP'S FUCKED UP NOW.

&gt;[1:37] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; PROCEED ASAP. 

&gt;[1:54] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; SOMETHING NASTY'S GOING ON, AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WASTE OUR TIME TALKING.

&gt;[1:43] &lt;Cyrynyl Garann&gt; WELL, WHATEVER DEFINITION OF "TIME" MAKES SENSE WHEN SOMETHING AS FUCKED UP AS *THIS* IS GOING ON.
