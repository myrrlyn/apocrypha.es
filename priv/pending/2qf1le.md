NARRATOR, facing the audience:  Tonight we have the honor to present to you the Tale of the Brave Little Scrib, a lesson on dunmer morality and society, and a warning against falling prey to the seduction of being led from one's duty.



ENTER KWAMA QUEEN and SCRIBS.  KWAMA QUEEN should strike a pose center stage back, putting her hands at her hips, and SCRIBS should kowtow around her.  ENTER KWAMA WORKER who should proceed to stage left and use his hammer against the wall.  ENTER KWAMA WARRIOR, who should proceed to stage right and practice with blades or sword and shield. 
 


NARRATOR:  Brave Little Scrib lived with the Kwama Queen, the workers, and the warriors. They were a free colony of kwama, not bound to a Dark Elf mine or any other form of servitude, and busily went about their kwama lives.



KWAMA QUEEN: Sing praises, my scribs! 
 


SCRIB: We tend all day to our eggs in our mine.
SCRIB: We protect and we abide!
SCRIB:  With diligence and with honor
SCRIB:  Our duties are our pride!



ENTER BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB, who stands center front and /sigh
 


BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB: I am so terribly bored!  All I wish to do is experience excitement and adventure, and all day long I am simply ordered about by the older kwama, and given lecture after lecture and lesson after lesson.


 
BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB approaches KWAMA WORKER.
 


KWAMA WORKER stops using the hammer, shakes his head, and then continues to use the hammer.



KWAMA WORKER, looking at BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB: What is it this time, little one?

 

BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB:  Tell me, Worker, what is it that makes you smarter than me?

 

KWAMA WORKER says in an impatient tone:  I'm older than you, Scrib. And I'm always very busy, so I know what's best. You need to stay away from the waterfall. Trust me, you're better off keeping busy than playing in the stream.
 


BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB tenses her body, looking frustrated.



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB huffs as she walks over to KWAMA WARRIOR.



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB: Perhaps you can tell me, brave warrior of our people.  Why can I not play in the waterfall?



KWAMA WARRIOR shields his eyes with his hand, turning his head back and forth to look at the audience.



KWAMA WARRIOR is to keep looking at the crowd as he speaks.



KWAMA WARRIOR: The waterfall? You can't fight the waterfall, Little Scrib. Water is cold and fast and it makes you drown. You should go back to the egg chamber and play with the other scribs where the other warriors and I can watch over you.



KWAMA WARRIOR draws his weapons and stalks back and forth on the stage.



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB is to tense her body and then stomp the stage floor.



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB:  Well!  If no one can give me a really good reason why I can't play in the waterfall, then...I'm going to go play in the waterfall!



KWAMA QUEEN: Devoted Scribs, what values do we uphold?



SCRIB: Piety!



SCRIB: Duty!



SCRIB: Loyalty!



SCRIB: Honor!



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB: Waterfall adventures!



EXIT STAGE LEFT KWAMA WARRIOR, KWAMA QUEEN AND SCRIBS, and KWAMA WORKER.  ENTER STAGE RIGHT TORCHBUG.



TORCHBUG is to begin dancing.



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB is to approach TORCHBUG.



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB: Hello, tiny Torchbug.



TORCHBUG is to sing: Oh, hello, Little Scrib. What brings you to this part of the cave?



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB jumps around the stage.



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB says cheerfully:  I've come to play in the waterfall. Will you fly away so I can pass?



TORCHBUG beckons BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB to the waterfall.



STAGEHANDS are to use enchanted buckets to continually splash water onto TORCHBUG and BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB to simulate a waterfall.



TORCHBUG is to sing:  Oh, yes. I'll happily fly out of your way. I haven't seen anyone drown in the waterfall in quite some time, and I find the sight very entertaining. Please, hurry. I need a good laugh.



TORCHBUG laughs at BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB  looks surprised at TORCHBUG



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB says worriedly: You want to see me drown?



TORCHBUG sings:  Well, I guess I don't really care one way or another, but I do enjoy a good drowning. Do you know how to swim, Little Scrib?



TORCHBUG laughs at BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB and beckons her to the waterfall.



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB places her hand on her chin, thinking.



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB: I know how to swim, but I don't think I feel like playing in the waterfall today. Maybe tomorrow. See you later, Torchbug.



TORCHBUG:  If you insist, Little Scrib. Have a good day.



TORCHBUG waves at BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB.



TORCHBUG EXIT STAGE LEFT



BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB stands center stage.  



NARRATOR:  And Brave Little Scrib wandered back to the egg chamber, looking for another adventure.  Be wise, my friends, and heed this warning.  One may find duty and the familiar tedious, and the teasing of the torchbug easily ignored.  But the waters beyond are dangerous and deadly, and more than a Scrib can overcome.  



The highest honor lies in knowing your own purpose, and your own limitations.  Sometimes bravery is knowing how not to be foolhardy.



CAST enters and stands behind BRAVE LITTLE SCRIB.  All bow towards the audience.
