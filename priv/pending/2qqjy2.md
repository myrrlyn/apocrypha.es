Last message from Kaldius Harvo, captain of the lost legion of the 
Imperial Mananauts from the time of Remans Dynasty during the first era.  Message found in a mysterious small box washed up on the northern shores of skyrim,  during the time of the Skyrim Civil War, during the 4th Era. (Found by an Imperial Soldier and given to general Tullius)

We have seen all possible futures , It showed us!  there is no stopping them!!
the Yokudans of old tried to stop them!! the Akaviri of the new also tried!! We of the present too tried!! They will win! they will laugh and laugh and they will have their long awaited victory!!!  give up your hope, give up your faith in the nine. There is no salvation for mankind, only nothingness...
