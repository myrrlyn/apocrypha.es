*Drem Yol Lok, Greetings Dovahkiin. You seek me out again, no doubt for meditations upon a Rotmulaag. What word is calling to you?*

Zul, the Shout seems odd for a dragon to use, what can you tell me about it?

*“Voice” in your language. Indeed, the dovah did not use this thu’um often. We created it for the joore that stayed loyal to the Dragon Cult during the war, it served to distract and fool those it was used upon, either to avoid conflict or create opportunities for ambush. However the ability to confuse is only one use for this Rot. Think of this Dovahkiin, how many ways might your Zul, Voice be applied? What other uses could you use the Rotmulaag to your advantage? That is the meaning of “Zul.” To express yourself, your inner Zii through the use of your Voice and thu’um. What will you actions will you create through it? Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that your Voice will influence more than simply Mey.*
