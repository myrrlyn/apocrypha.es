Drem Yol Lok, Paarthurnax, I’ve returned yet again.

*Hmmm, again you humor me with the dov speech Dovahkiin. Your Onikaan Nir, search of wisdom continues. What Rotmulaag is calling to you?*

Wuld.

*It is “Whirlwind” in your tongue. For joore this thu’um is seen as a sprint along the Golt. For the dovah it is  Su Fonaar, charge through the air. It can serve many purposes, entering battle or escaping it. Like the thu’um, Su, you interact with the air and Ven, wind around you. However instead of calling upon it to yield, you ask it to aid you, to spirit you along to your own ends. Recall how the winds of Keizaal sweep through the Pindaar and Strunmah, the fields and mountains. It yields to none. That is the meaning of “Wuld.” To become one with the wind, the Unslaad Kest that pauses for naught. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that the Ven will carrying you even further Dovahkiin.*
