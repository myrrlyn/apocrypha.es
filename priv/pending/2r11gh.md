*Greetings Dovahkiin, speak and I shall listen. What would you meditate upon today?*

Gaan, its clearly another word that wasn’t intended for worship. How do the dragons use it most effectively?

*“Stamina” in your tongue. The thu’um does not empower these forces within you, but latches on to your foes and Luv Rii Lass, tears at their very life forces. Its Suleyk comes from its simplicity, a dovah or warrior cannot Krif, fight, if they are weakened so. By draining away what is vital in life you embraces the Fen Wah Suleyk, will to power over those who oppose you. It comes naturally to the dovah, you feel it do you not Dovahkiin? Do not fall to the Palok of the power though, lest you become like Alduin. Think of it as this, drain away the essence that feeds evil and cruelty, leave that which is peaceful and Pruzah. That is the meaning of “Gaan” as I understand it. To fight those who would enslave and dominate by taking that which is vital to them. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that your thu’um acts quicker and takes faster.*
