Greetings Mentor Paarthurnax. I’ve been traveling far and wide and I have found more Words of Power, I was wondering what you could tell me about them.

*You prove yourself a Lingrah Wunduniik Dovahkiin. Your knowledge continues to grow, what Rotmulaag have you discovered?*

Do you know anything about Mid?

*“Loyal” in your tongue. Yes the thu’um is known to me. It was created by the dovah for the Valok of Solstheim, after he did Grah Voth Tahrodlis Mirrak. The thu’um effects those who follow you, the Valok had a large following after his victory. No doubt that you to Dovahkiin have many who would show Midrot Unslaad for you. Think of this, you are dovah in Zil, made to dominate, tame your inner passion to dominate with the mantle of Kinbok, leader. How does one best inspire their followers? Example. Show the valor and courage that you expect from your Kendov, warriors and they will harken to you with even greater devotion. That is the meaning of “Mid.” To lead from the front, to show honor and valor in front of all who can see, so that they to shall show the same qualities under your Aak, guide. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that all of your followers will be effected for longer.*
