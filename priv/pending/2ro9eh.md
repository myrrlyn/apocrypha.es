Mentor Paarthurnax, will you teach me about another Word of Power I learned while traveling Solstheim?

*You have shown yourself Onik Ahrk Bonaar. Yes Dovahkiin, I will teach you, what Rotmulaag have you learned in your travels?
*
Ven.

*It means “Wind” in your tounge. I have consuled you on “Wuld” which allows you to call upon wind for travel. This thu’um calls upon it to be used as a Zun, a weapon. It can be especially damaging to the dovah, when the wind is turned against us. Most have no choice but to land upon the Golt, ground, where we are weaker. When used against the joore it can sow chaos amongst their ranks, during the Dragon War the dovah used it to rout the Nords without direct combat. Think of it as this Dovahkiin, the mayhem and havoc that result from this thu’um is the desired Oblaan. That is the meaning of “Ven.” Not to outright Krii Paal, kill all those who oppose you, but to insight panic and hysteria amongst your enemies. Call upon the wind to aid you in this. Su’um ahrk morah. You will find that the Ven will obey you for much longer*.
