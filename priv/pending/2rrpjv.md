*Hmmm, more on your Hadrim Dovahkiin? You appear to have more that you would ask.*


I know there are Shouts that are unknown to you Paarthurnax, but are the Words known to you?

*Indeed there are those thu’ums that are unknown to me, but I have long studied even the Rotmulaags of those I cannot know, what word is calling to you?*

Mul.

*“Strength” in your tongue. You seek Onikaan upon the thu’um Wahlaan Naal Tahrodiis Miraak? Hopefully you will not fall to the arrogance of power that consumed him. You are Ysmir Dovahkiin, the Dragon of the North, they could not look upon Talos without seeing a dovah, so shall you appear to the joore. You carry the blood and soul of a dovah, as you invoke this thu’um you harken to your true Rii, essence. Think of it as this Dovahkiin, as you become closer to your true self you will find that power growing inside you. Your limbs will assume the strength of the dovah’s claws, you will be protected as if you carried my scales, and you will understand the natural essence of the thu’um. That is the true meaning of “Mul.” To have your outer self match your inner soul, to find balance between the two and to understand the gift you have been given. Koogan Akatosh. You will find that this understanding is indefinite.*
