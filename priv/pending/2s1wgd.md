On the city of Northpoint:

The City of Northpoint was established by the travelling Breton merchant by the name of Yric Flowdys. The deep waters there made it easy for large vessels to cross, even though it didn’t form an ideal harbor. The location would also form an ideal place for traders on the summer route from Daggerfall to Solitude to resupply, hide for storm or repair their ships if needed. The captain constructed his first docks at Northpoint, and the small town took over the name. He also provided the town with a small castle and a warehouse, and soon Northpoint became the prominent trading town in the region.

When Captain Yric saw the success of his town, he took the name of the mountain Dore Ellard, where he had made his seat of power,  as his new family name, ensuring that his offspring could continue to rule this town, and the lands surrounding it. And so they did, lending fertile lands to farmers, expending on the town and its docks and gaining new incomes by establishing solid trading agreements with Solitude. The citizens of Northpoint became richer than ever, and the Dorells where widely known as trading princes, and even granted barony when Empress Hestra incorporated High Rock in the First Empire, 1E 1029.

The Dorells were seen as Rivenspire’s true elite, being heads of not only Northpoint, but also Shornhelm. The other families in the region made sure that the Dorells got their fair share of politic intrigue. Combined with their exceptionally ambitious thoughts, the family was one to be reckoned with.

In the Second Era, the family’s wealth and power grew even more, mercantile and military, staying close to High Rock’s court. The Dorells are militaristic and politically powerful, and their mercantile traditions have given them a level of wealth rarely seen in Rivenspire circles. House Dorell has generated extensive ties with merchants in Solitude. This, they are quick to point out, has nothing to do with the sword rattling of politics. To Dorell, this is simply good business.

The people of Northpoint take pride in their ruling family, the Dorells, and rarely speak ill about them. Their wealth is looked at in envy throughout Rivenspire, but they could not care less, since they are rarely seen in any other city in the region. Much like in Daggerfall, although a bit less fancy, their culture is full of song and culture, sometimes with a bit of Nordic flavor, brought over by merchants from Solitude. But above all, the people of Northpoint are friendly and outgoing, but they always take a chance of good trade arrangements.
