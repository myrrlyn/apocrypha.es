*The burnt offerings simmer upon the altar - profane and grotesque remnants of undead. The skull of a Lich. The flesh of a zombie. The eyes of a Draugr. The ectoplasm of a Wraith. The wrappings of a Wispmother. All arrayed in a perfect geometrical pattern. Suddenly, the flames transform into pure light and the form of a woman appears. She is beautiful beyond mortal limit, and bathed in light.*

**MERIDIA IS COME. THE LADY OF LIGHT ACCEPTS YOUR OFFERING, MORTAL. HAVE YOU COME TO BEG FOR A BLESSING, OR DO YOU SEEK MY ARTIFACTS? SPEAK QUICKLY. I HAVE LIMITED PATIENCE.**

Actually, I have a question for you. 

**INSOLENCE. YOU SPEAK OUT OF TURN, LITTLE MORTAL. I SHOULD INCINERATE YOU WHERE YOU STAND. I SEE NOW YOUR AMULET OF KYNARETH. GO WORSHIP YOUR FALSE GODS, DOG.**

I'm not here to scorn or mock you, Lady. I simply wanted to hear your thoughts on what Love is.

*Meridia is silent for a moment. A shadow passes over her face, and she turns as if to leave. She pauses before disappearing into the column of light and speaks once more, more softly, almost as a mortal.*


**"That's simple, for me. Love means being willing to sacrifice everything you are for something or someone you care about. It is through my love that mortals like you draw breath and stand before me, pestering me with such questions."**

But wasn't it mother Kynareth who breathed life into mortals? Isn't it true that Daedra cannot create?

**"An amusing question. A question only a mortal would find meaningful. Things are not so simple as you assume. I'll leave you with a riddle of my own, to ponder in all the long years ahead: The sun transforms night into day, but what transforms the mind? When you can answer that, you'll understand what Love is, and why your questions are meaningless. I've wasted enough time here."**

*With a flash, the Lady was gone, and the scholar was left alone in darkness to ponder her riddle.*
