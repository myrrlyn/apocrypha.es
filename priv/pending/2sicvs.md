**CHAPTER 2:**
**Hierarchy**

The governing body of the Synod is the Council, a group of nine total participants: eight councilors and the Arch-Mage, who oversees and leads the council sessions. For most issues of importance, the Council votes on decisions by a majority vote. However, the Arch-Mage is capable of vetoing decisions unless he is the only one in opposition, in which case his veto is rejected.


Each councilor can have up to two Literators, individuals who assume the role of a secretary/apprentice to the councilor. Literators usually organize and coordinate the research projects personally funded by the councilors themselves. They also assume the role of leadership at chapters, supervising local projects and providing judicial services to domestic problems. In definition, Literators are part of the Council, but aren't permitted to vote in Council matters. However, this rule can be lifted by the Arch-Mage if he/she requests additional insight into an issue.


If there are two Literators under a councilor, responsibilities are generally divided between the two, assigning new titles to each one. First Adjuncts serve as political advisers and heads of financing; these are individuals of whom the councilor can put the most trust in, which requires vigorous proof of loyalty. This position also serves as head of the judicial board of local chapters. Second Adjuncts are heads of research, working to compile data from the councilor's projects. This position is reserved for the brightest minds in the Synod outside of the Council, requiring superior knowledge in all studies of magic. They also serve as the head of peer-review boards for proposals and data of local research.

 
At the chapters, there are three positions held by lower members. Attendants are mages who are allowed to conduct their own research, receiving their funding from the overseeing councilor. Although the Attendant gets to keep credit for their work, any profit made from their research is collected by the councilor who originally funded them. They are eligible to serve in local political board positions, but only the most experienced researchers end up gaining the attention of a councilor to get to serve. If called upon, they are also obliged to work directly for the Council on special assignments. Those students that are not Attendants are Observers, newer members who do most of the field work for Synod research. Several years working as an Observer are needed before any mage has the opportunity to declare Attendance, a peer-reviewed proposal of their research project of choice. After announcing Attendance, the Observer is promoted to a Scribe and has four years to prepare, gaining access to the full disposal of resources available at the chapter. At this point, Scribe's spend most of their time studying and preparing for their proposal date. However, during this time, they can still be summoned to help with field work for a councilor's project. 


To be accepted into the Synod, applicants must present themselves before the Council and request entry into the organization. The test for acceptance varies between individuals, with most involving a demonstration of magic potential. Because most entry-level members will do years of field work before being capable of conducting research, the standards for entry are fairly low, but still require magic talent nonetheless.
