We have gone by many titles during these longs quests of acquisition.

The Bretons called us Hjalti Early-Beard. When we ascended the seven thousand steps the Greybeards entitled us Ysmir. And when we returned from those summits the Nords knew us as Talos Stormcrown. Our fallen liege named us General and as we claimed the Ruby Throne we took on the Imperial moniker of Tiber Septim. Both our legions and our enemies gave us the title of the Red Jewel of Conquest. All of Tamriel referred to us as their Emperor of a New Glorified Empire. And now the entirety of Nirn knows of us as the God of Men, Talos.

Some call us heroes, others villains. We have called ourselves liars three times and scorned our own name once from two very different life paths, and both the Thief of Morrowind and the Mage of Talk called us...friend. We take on the guise of man, fox, dragon, and magic. Are we all, neither, both?

We ask you of this now, our dear Empire: How well do you know your god Tamriel? And what will you name us after you learn the truths behind all we have done?
