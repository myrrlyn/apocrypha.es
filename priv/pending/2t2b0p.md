*An odd change of circumstances Qahnarrin, you come to me in this cursed place instead of summoning me to Taazokaan. What purpose brings you back to the Soul Cairn?*

Your thu’um, Rii. I wish to know more about it. I’ve rarely ever met the original creator of a Shout. Will you tell me about the meaning you put into it?

*You seek out wisdom from the vanquished? Hmmm you should know better than to ask the defeated for knowledge Qahnarrin. Yet I did create this thu’um and perhaps can offer you who bested me insight.*

*“Rii” is Essence in the tongue of the joore. This thu’um is the truest expression of Alok-Dilon, Necromancy. To simultaneously kill your foe, capture their soul, and then command their undead flesh is what all who dabble in the forbidden craft wish to achieve. They must rely upon their magical arts, you Qahnarrin can use your thu’um, a power only you and I command. As in nearly all things with the dovah, we strive for domination, no doubt you feel it stronger than I. This thu’um gives you the means to do so in a way that no one else can comprehend. Use my gift to you well and few will be able to stand before you.*
