Hail to the Dragonborn, Ysmir, Qahnaarin, ahkr fin Dovahkiin. Harbinger, Stormblade, and Savior of Skyrim. His legend is truth, and his name is sacred.

The Dovahkiin shared a prisoners cart with a warrior, a king, and a thief, all destined for the chopping block. They would not all die on this day however, for mighty Alduin, free from the wound upon the mountain, came down to devour mortal men. Red legions fought the beast while the Dragonborn armed himself and fought his way to freedom.

The Dragonborn swore his loyalty to Whiterun, and went with the warriors of Balgruuf to slay the dragon Mirmulnir. Kynareth breathed air into his lungs for the first time, and he shouted to all of Skyrim, for he was Dragon Kind Hunter. When Mirmulnir ceased to be, the Greybeards shook the land and summoned the Dovahkiin to High Hrothgar.

It was at High Hrothgar that he was crowned Ysmir, and turned back to the world to learn the Thu'um. Deceived he became, when he was met with The Blades, and charged with killing Mer and Dov in their honor. The Greybeards forgave this deception, and allowed the Dragonborn to climb to the Throat where Paarthurnax lead him to a Scroll of Old Words. The Ysmir read the scroll inside the wound and learned Joor Zah Frul from the men of old.

Alduins fire scorched the ancient ice, and his claws broke stone, but he was thrown to earth, his immortality taken. Dovahkiins steel clashed with  scale, and the Devourer found himself waning. He fled to Sovengarde to feast on the honored dead that seek entry to Shor's Hall. The Dragonborn was skillful, and rhode on dragons back to Sovengarde. Dovahkiin wandered through Alduins snare until he met Tsun, whom he battled and was allowed entry into Shor's Hall. The Tongues allied with the Dovahkiin called Alduin to the Gates of Shor's Hall, and it was there that they slew the Devourer.

Hail to the Dragonborn, Ysmir, Qahnaarin, ahkr fin Dovahkiin. Harbinger, Stormblade, and Savior of Skyrim. May he die and live in Sovengarde forever.
