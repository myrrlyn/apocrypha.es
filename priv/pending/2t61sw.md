Two cultists of the First, who was Miraak, attacked the Dragon with fire and steel. In reaction two blades were forged from ebony with daedric blood, one large, and one small. The Dragon tracked the first to Solstheim, in Morrowind. With a maiden of ice and a child of flame, the Dragon sieged the temple of Miraak, and stole away with a Black Book. 

The Dragon brought the book to the Skaal, who guided him to a word learned long ago. The Dragon broke free the people of Solstheim with this word, and seeking the aide of Neloth, who was a Telvani, reclaimed the book containing the second word. 

These books had a master, Herma Mora. The trickster demon and knower of secrets. Mora called upon the Dragon, and gifted him the second word. The knowledge was incomplete, so the demon demanded a price for the third. The secrets of the Skaal must be surrendered, and Miraak must be killed. These terms would be met.

At the Summit of Apocrypha, the Dragon slew Miraak, and took his place, unwillingly, at Moras side. The Ysmir, Qahnaarin, ahkr fin Dovahkiin, was enslaved, yet remained, and spent his years searching Apocrypha for the knowledge needed to unbind him from Mora and unleash his soul unto Sovengarde.
