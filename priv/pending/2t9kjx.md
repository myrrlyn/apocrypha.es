*I would like to begin my newest work with a word to the wise: however great you might feel your theories are, they are never beyond criticism. With much assistance from many scholarly associates, I have come to alter my previous theories threefold. I am not ashamed of my past errors; instead I am elated to be working with others towards a higher truth. With that in mind I would like to single out the ever-watchful scholar Caspus, who has given me access to the ancient works of Queen Ayrenn herself! These dusty tomes contained hidden knowledge that I’m sure the Khajiit would prefer remained so. I write this examination of the Khajiiti creation myth with the same goal as before, with the intent to make sense of them through the lens of what we know actually happened: the Altmeri Creation myth.*

.

**On Lorkhan's Intent**

.

Firstly, and with much humility, I must state that the Khajiit DO NOT view Lorkhan in any positive light. In my previous eagerness to create an interesting and new truth with contrast to the Redguard mythos, I had naively convinced myself otherwise. It is clear now that this is not the case. Within the Tomes of Queen Ayrenn there is a quote from the reigning Mane of the time: 
&gt;“The Dark Moon, the enemy of the Khajiit. Lorkhaj, the Missing God.”

This settles the argument quite succinctly.

**The Great Darkness**

.

And with this, we now return to the force which filled the Heart of Lorkhaj, “The Great Darkness”. I had previously theorized that this Darkness represented the void. That which lies beyond both Anu and Padomay. As advised by my associates, I have altered this theory significantly. To understand this darkness, we must read the lines that come just before it.
&gt;Ahnurr caught Fadomai while she was still birthing, and he was angry. Ahnurr struck Fadomai and she fled to birth the last of her litter far away in the Great Darkness.

We know that Anu and Padomay represent all there is; and that the Aurbis is the interplay between the two.  This interplay results in the et’Ada. The question then becomes, how can you flee from something when you and that thing are the only two entities in existence? The answer is **you must retreat into yourself**.  The great darkness is Fadomai. To be “filled with the great darkness” is to be born with a deep association to Padomay, as opposed to the interplay between the two. This coincides perfectly with what we believe of Lorkhan . What this means of Namiira is another topic entirely. One which I intend to address in my next work: Namira, Prince of Ancient Darkness. (Working Title)

**The Ja-kha'jay**

.

Finally, we arrive now at my past assumption that the Ja-kha’jay and the moons were different entities. I have now come to the conclusion that the “Lunar Lorkhan” theory presented in the book by Fal Droon of the same name (which I previously subscribed to) is false. Why? Again, we consult the Tomes of Ayrenn, which evidence a much different story. **There are, in fact, 3 moons**. One is invisible to all but the Khajiit. (I note here that while this is new information to me, it is likely common knowledge within Arteum and amongst high-ranking Thalmor) Not only had the previously mentioned Mane spoke of this, a high ranking agent of the old Aldmeri Dominion (who’s trust is purportedly not in question) confirmed the theory. With this, I feel there is more evidence against the Lunar Lorkhan theory than there is in its favor, and an abundance of evidence to support a third, invisible moon. 
Then what is to be made of Jone and Jode? For this, we consult some of the oldest works known to mer: What we find, and what seems to not be spoken of much, is a work presented by the illustrious Temple Zero Society.
&gt;Moons are regarded by various cultures as attendant spirits of their god planet, or minor gods, or foreign gods …..Masser and Secunda ('Jone' and 'Jode' in the Ehlnofex), the moons of Nirn, are the attendant spirits of the mortal plane… The moons used to be pure white and featureless, but today their 'skin' is decaying and withering away… Mortals perceive this as the moons being spheres with patches of their 'surfaces' completely eaten away; as the moons spin, they seem to become slivers or ragged crescents. These are not caused by shadows, because you can see stars through the black patches of the lunar spheres.

So the moons are naught but other ancestors, (How Fal Droon’s conclusion ever gained such acceptance perplexes me still) whom mer before us referred to also as Jone and Jode. Lesser ancestors, who gave more than the eight (since they are completely dead), yet not as much as the Earthbones (as they retain their own plane(t)). Evidently, we ceased worshiping these gods Jone and Jode some time ago. I theorize that this was a result of the moons association with the Lunar Lattice and the consequential effects as a barrier within (and without) of the Aurbis.
Returning to the Ja’kha’jay, and why the Khajiit are the only society to worship this force. It is my new theory that the Ja-kha’jay is the lasting effect that our ancestors Jone and Jode sacrificed themselves for in creation of Mundus. To make an analogy, it would be as if the Khajiit worshipped the wind, instead of Khenarthi. The Ja-kha’jay is a force, one that is a result of an ancestor. It is a unique effect in that it was a dual effort from two ancestors, but otherwise not very different than the sacrifices of the others. (A similar situation to that of the Bosmer which adhere to the Green Pact, the lasting effect of the first earthbone, Y’frre.) With this new understanding of the ja-kha’jay, all which I mentioned in my previous work in regards to the Lunar Lattice still holds. We must accept that the forces of Jode and Jone are part of what stabilizes the Mundus. (As in my last text, I suggest the reader view this as evidence of the Khajiiti tower, and refer them to the disappearance of the moons.) 

**Closing Remarks**

As this book is only an update to my [previous work](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2so4sk/an_analysis_of_the_words_of_a_khajiit_clanmother/), I would recommend that for a fuller understanding of what was discussed here you seek out its predecessor. With these three updates to my theory, two of which only strengthen my previous argument that the Khajiiti and Altmeri mythos are the same (Khajiit think Lorkhan is bad and he is born with an association to Padomay) and the other which only contradicts a theory that was not within our accepted mythos to begin with (Lunar Lorkhan), I believe my goal has truly been accomplished. Once and for all, I believe the Khajiiti mythos can be seen as not incorrect on any count, merely a different telling of the same tale.
