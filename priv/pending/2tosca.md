*And from the darkness, he woke from his slumber. Rising from the sepulchre from which he rested for aeons untold, did the chosen hero of the gifter look to us, and from his dried cracked lips tell us of his matron in a voice that drove half of us mad.*

Hi, been awhile.

---------------------------

I've had a hankering to tackle Vaermina a bit more. So, I've decided to run with an errant thought I had not 20 minutes ago.


Something has always bothered me about the distinct lack of lore surrounding the figure of nightmares, especially considering that the reality of TES is all the dream of Anu.


Another point of confusion I have always had was over her titles. Namely, the Weaver of the Panoply.


Of course, the title of the Gifter makes perfect sense. I've always seen her in a masochistic nihilist light, driving her followers to shed the fear associated with the mortal coil, achieve CHIM, and ultimately, escape the dream. Her nightmares are a gift, to help release mortals from their bonds.


The Weaver of the Panoply had me stumped, until I was struck by an errant thought that seemed to clear up some things for me.


I personally believe that each of the Aedra and the Daedric Princes play an integral part in the formation of the Aurbis. If any of you are familiar with /u/IceFireWarden's Echmer, I am specifically speaking to these beings as their embodied ideals (ie Mehrunes Dagon = Destruction) a la ATEDA.


Sticking with Dagon as an example for the moment, I believe that the Dagon is to the Aurbis like an organ is to us. An integral part of it, that is. Each of the et'ada are a core component of the grey maybe, each performing their own key function. Dagon is the garbage collector. The destroyer of ideals as it were. Not a hard leap (pun intended), I don't think.


Back to Vaermina. Her spheres, as I have come to see them, involve memory, and dreams (nightmares specifically). I see her as the embodiment of the Loss of Nir. But what does this mean for her role in the aurbis? I mean, nightmares aren't all that important, and surely the other et'ada's have memory covered sufficiently, right? Well, I would disagree.


While Magnus and Hermaeus Mora each have a specific tie to memory, they both have clearly defined roles in the make up of the aurbis (Magnus, as energy/potential and H.M. as a being made of 'what was left'). Vaermina's tie is a little more tenuous. I mean, her connection with water (the muddy quagmire) as memory is rather obscure. Then it hit me. It is in her title, 'the weaver of the panoply'. In this sense, I take panoply to mean the aurbis. 


What I am saying is that she is the weaver that ties the entirety of the Aurbis together. A sort of foundation of it, if you will. This might sound crazy, but bare with me for a moment. I believe that because Anu only began to dream because of the loss of Nir, it only makes sense to place Vaermina as the foundation. The dreaming state is founded upon the horror of the death of Nir. Vaermina is that embodiment.


Am I crazy? Probably. I'm looking for discussion and thoughts on this.
