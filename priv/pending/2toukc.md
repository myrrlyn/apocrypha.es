The Traveler's Guide to 9th Era Aurbis
-------------



-----------------------------------------------------------

**An Introduction**

Greetings Intrepid Traveler!

The following guide will attempt (for no doubt, you already know that the shear size of the place, and distinct lack of chronological ordering of any kind makes it impossible to be completely thorough) to line out various important bits of information of places of note throughout the Great Grey Maybe!

The First Chapter will cover the various useful things one might need while travelling the aurbis, and how each one is useful in different situations.


The Second Chapter dives head first into the various political presences in the Grey Maybe, and what you need to keep in mind when you come under each of their areas of influence. If there is one chapter you don't miss, I beg you it is this one. I mean, you wouldn't want to be the one to make a temporal slip in front of a Jill now would you? No, I think not.


The Third and final chapter goes into detail on the geography (or, well, distinct lack thereof) that composes the aurbis, its bounds (read: the Void), and information on the various locales. This will cover everything from the tattered remnants of the Mundus, the shining stars that lead into the realm of Aetherius, the oft misunderstood Dreamsleave, and of course, the dread planes of Oblivion!


And a final piece of advice for you, the travelers who brave the waters of oblivion: Don't Panic! It is important to remember who you are at all times.
