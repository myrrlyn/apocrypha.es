**Things you might need on your travels.**

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain things need to be taken care of before one leaves on a journey. Generally speaking, you need to know where you are going, and how you are to get there. Unfortunately, as you might have heard, this is significantly easier said then done in the Maybe.

A good place to start, of course, is a destination. It's hard to reach anywhere in the Aurbis, if you don't know what it is you are going to. And, quite unfortunately (and more often than not, I assure you) things tend to come to you. So it is best you are prepared. A destination acts a goal. A goal in turn acts as an anchor point, and this is very, VERY important. Not only is it easy to lose your way in the Maybe, it is easy to lose ONESELF in the Aurbis.

This leads us to our next needed item: A profound sense of self. Now, if you are traveling within the Mundus, this is not entirely necessary, as the various bodies that make up the Mundus will help with that. If you plan on heading beyond the Mundus, it is imperative that you know yourself. Now, you might wonder why one would need to know oneself in the waters of oblivion. "Isn't that sort of thing best left to the philosophers?" You might ask. I will respond with a resounding no. Unless of course you enjoy the idea of dis-incorporation in Oblivion. You would be surprised at the amount of people that are.

As a mortal of the Mundus, we face our own assortment of challenges. The Jillian-Hist War rages on (and the Hist seem to be winning, as it has gone on indefinitely), and knowing when you are is difficult. However, the Mundus is still bound by the Aedra, so most of who you are is up to them. At least while you're within their influence. Hopefully you begin to see the direction in which I am heading. The 'Divines' have little influence outside of the Mundus. That leaves being 'you' up to 'you'. And I assure you that this is a much more difficult test of will then many are capable of solo.

So, in order to aid oneself in keeping a sense of self, there are a number of tips and tricks we have accumulated over the years:

1. Travel in at least pairs if this is your first time into the waters, and have at least one person dedicated to reminding the both of you who you are.

2. Always, ALWAYS travel with a token. Something of significance to you. This can be anything from a favorite book (this one perhaps) or the picture of a loved one. The point is, it needs to remind you of YOU.

3. Don't ever travel in the wake of an existential crisis. EVER. Both you and anyone traveling with you will thank you.

4. A journal helps immensely.

It is important to note that we are fragile, as mortals, and that must be taken into consideration when one travels the Mundus and beyond. Hiring protection, or being able to protect yourself are a must! While it is easy to drown in the Waters of Oblivion, it is just as easy to have your heart stop from a well placed blade, claw, fireball, or other violent means.

Remember: Protect your self - Mind, Soul, and Body!
