 The frozen wastelands of snow and ice stood before them. To most, uninhabitable. The distant green summers had long past from the currents of time, and to the dragons now assembled on its shoreline, the chilling green had past into memory. 

 “*It has been a great while since the dov laid their eyes on Atmorasewuth. Much has changed since we were last here*.” Paarthurnax observed.

“*Odd thuri, that you would shepherd the dovah to a place long forsaken by the joore*.” Odahviing said.

“It’s the very reason that will keep your kind safe. Here, we are free from the prying eyes of those who would do you harm.”

The Dragonborn looked up at the dragons who flew into the sky, breathing gouts of burning flame, and streams of frost, adding to the freezing air. These were the same dragons that greeted him on the Throat of the World, after his cataclysmic duel with the World-Eater.

“Here you can govern yourselves.”

“*But what of you Dovahkiin? These frozen wastes are no longer meant for joore, even for one of the dovahsos*.” Paarthurnax inquired.

“I am staying. Leaving the home of Ysgramor and his sons as soon as I’ve arrived? No man has set foot here for millennia. I plan to...explore.”

“*I’m not sure what you expect to find in the ice here thuri. A home for dov yes, but for you*?”

“Leave that to me.”
