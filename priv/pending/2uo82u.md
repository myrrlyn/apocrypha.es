The names of dragons are Words of Power as well, what can you tell me about your name Durnehviir?

*I had a name before I became enslaved by the Ideal Masters, its is not worth remembering, it is not who I am now. I took a new name, Curse-Never Dying. It is what I have become, this place, the Soul Cairn is what sustains me. It is true that the dovah Sil, soul, is eternal but our bodies can wither and fail, mine remains in this constant state of Liiv Unslaad. My body shall never perish as long as I remain in this dreadful place, beware my fate Qahnarrin, deal only with what can master, lest you forced to take a new name. I have given you my name freely because you have bested me Qahnarrin, do not give yours out freely. Of course many know it, but how many*   **know** *it? Once a dovahâ€™s name is given to another, they can call them, from all places, would you answer their call, if you did not? Ponder the name I have given you Qahnarrin. Perhaps you will know yourself better than before.*
