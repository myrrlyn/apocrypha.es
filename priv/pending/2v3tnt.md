#Namira, Spirit Daedra#
*by Dolanaaro Corvus*

Known as both Namira and Namiira; she is perhaps the least understood of all Daedric Princes. Commonly accepted as the “Lady of Decay”, Namira is associated with creatures that aid in post-mortem decomposition of the body (Insects, maggots, slugs, etc) Yet this is just one aspect of her influence. To truly understand her, I have scoured across Tamriel for even the slightest mention of the Prince. 

##The Other Side##
Within *The Book of Daedra* it is said Namira is the “ruler of sundry dark and shadowy spirits.” Her true sphere is not Decay, it is “The Ancient Darkness”.(1)  A quite different picture than that held by many of my Altmer brethren. In my study of Khajiiti creation myths, I have come to understand this hidden side of Namira.

To the Khajiit, Namiira is “The Great Darkness” (2). A primordial force which played an integral role in the creation of Mundus. A corrupting influence on the Heart of Lorkhan. After weeks of coaxing information out of  khajiit “moon bishops” (all of which were loose-lipped when it came to speaking their minds, but conveniently tight-lipped when it came to answering specific questions) I am able to provide a summary of this “darkness”.

Namiira is decay insofar as she is the undoing of what is done. The making less of that which is more than zero. To this effect, she is seen as the force which causes us to be less than our ancestors, the et’Ada. Her “darkness” is seen as that which is not “lightness”. The nothingness that is contrast to our somethingness. For this reason, Namira is associated with “instinctive revulsion” (1). A natural response when confronted with one’s diametric opposite.

##Dark Spirits##
Of the various dark spirits under Namira’s command, the Khajiit are best aquainted with the dro-m’athra: Khajiit which in life had danced the “bent dance” (3). (This is opposed to the “two moons dance” which is performed constantly by “true cats”(4).) Considering the “third moon” is the corpse of Lorkhan (5), and that these bent cats dance to the “beating of the Heart [of Lorkhan]” (3) and lastly that the “heart of Lorkhaj was filled with The Great Darkness” (2) a conclusion can be drawn that these spirits have some connection to Namiira. 

Further, it is even stated that these dro-m’athra are “dragged down by Namiira into the Dark Behind the World”.(3) I propose that through Khajiit veneration of Namiira, she is given a tighter grasp over their souls in the afterlife; and that “Dark Behind the World” is another name for the Scuttling Void, realm of Namiira. It is unknown to what purpose these dro-m’athra serve, but one thing is certain: their presence involves more destruction and death than it does dancing.


##Embracing Decay##
We look now to the most widely known work regarding Namira: *The Beggar Prince*.(6) Let it be said that not only is this book’s authorship in question, so too is its subject matter. There’s no evidence suggesting the contained events ever took place. Even if they did, the particular circumstances are of little consequence. More interestingly, we see Namira’s favor is bestowed in the form of embracing decay. This conforms with known worship of the Prince, and is the most notable aspect of this book.

Beyond the works of Khajiit and the previous book, only official imperial documents contain even a hint of information on the mysterious Prince. First we look to the original PGE, “To Namira, whose works endure forever” (7): A phrase rife with meaning. No works last forever, and through this only the Decay of Namira can persist. A powerful message, but one whose implications we’ve now established.

##The Scuttling Void##
Last, we arrive at the realm of Namira, which is just short of a complete mystery. The only information to be had is within the Imperial Census of the Daedric Realms. Of particular importance is that of all the Realms only 3 are closed: those of Namira, Hircine, and Sheogorath.(8) On the closing of Sheogorath’s we find internal documents indicating a “Greymarch.” Implying, as you are all aware, the total upheaval of the realm. A rare event which the wise steer clear of. This leaves the realm of Namira on par with Hircine’s Hunting Grounds in terms of peril. In other words, to enter the Scuttling Void is as dangerous (if not more so) as being **actively hunted** by the most fearsome creatures known to mer and man. A frightening prospect, indeed.

##Conclusion##
In the end, Namira remains inscrutable. The Khajiit appease her, not worship her. My answers will have to come from elsewhere, not Elsweyr. But worse yet, beyond the Khajiit no one seems to even grasp her realm of influence. I still hold firmly that Namira possesses vital knowledge on Creation. My research into this matter is not yet concluded.
