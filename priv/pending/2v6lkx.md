*A simple prayer among the common citizenry of Alessian Cyrodiil, circa 1E389*

Father Dragon,


Who orders the Heavens,


Prolix be thy names.


Thy Covenant stand,


Thy Empire grand,


Bathed in the light of Aetherius.


Give us this day renewal and certainty,


And forgive us our inconstancy,


As we forgive the inconstancy of others.


Defend us from Oblivion and the Princes of Misrule,


And deliver our souls unto your sanctity. 


For thine is rulership, power, legitimacy, and everlasting glory,


For all of Time.


In the name of the blessed Paravant,


Tam-RUGH!
