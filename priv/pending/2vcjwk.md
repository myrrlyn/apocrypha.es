*Appearing in 4E 25, this journal enjoyed popularity throughout the early 4th Era and the Great War within the Summerset Isles. Though dismissed as the ravings of a lunatic and not officially sanctioned by the Thalmor propaganda machine, its publication nevertheless served to galvanize Thalmor support.*

From Journal of Veindar the Mad of Alinor, Ex-Thalmor Captain

I have seen the city which no man may look upon, the holy city, the city that shall return, Aldmeris. After many days in the southern seas, sailing ever forward, we had begun to run low on supplies. The crew suggested we turn back, said that the home of our ancestors was sunk, said I was mad for going on. But I never doubted. I knew. I was meant to find it! Those fools deserved what they got. Yes, it was on day 1008, when I was the only one left, having eaten well of my crew long before, that my faith was rewarded. Tired, starving, dying I lay upon the deck with whispers of old Aldmeri songs in my mouth. Then saw it! A golden eagle circling the sun!

In that moment, I no longer saw with my eyes but with pure spirit. Like an infinite tapestry of crystal, the land revealed itself to me. I had become a piece of calligraphy, ink written upon glass. I saw my whole body, spread flat upon the plane. I had only one eye, only one ear. My chest was fixed as if constantly viewed from the front. And I was young. Younger than young.

Cleansed of depth and flesh, I could only move left and right, up and down. Yet moving itself was easier than ever. I felt weightless, as though something had held me down my entire life and now was gone. Three tears of joy fell from my eye, becoming three perfect blue circles that hung like night-lanterns.

As I moved down, our ancestors, their skin gleaming golden ink, came up to welcome me. They were tall, beautiful, without hair, without gender. We spoke our thoughts without sound, our words inscribing them selves in the space above our heads. Not really 'above', though. More like nearby. "Welcome kinsmer," they said. "We have waited long for our descendents to come back to us. Now you are here, please come join our song."

The buildings of the city were inked in many colors, inked in the magic of starlight itself. The thousand towers were many fathoms long and stretched beyond sight. "It takes us many days to get to end of some," said my hosts, "but we do not worry. We have time."

Periodically, we would pass near a thick green lines that spanned and shimmered across land. When I put my hand over the line, the line appeared to separate it from my arm. "What are these lines?" I asked my forefathers. "Those are edge-marks," they answered. "Our city lives within crystal and each time we cross an edge-line we pass to another facet. Such are the realms of the Magne-Fey, that our music and our glory may be appreciated by Lord Anuiel."

After seconds and centuries of walking, we came to the Center. The whole city was reflected within that one room, every shard reflecting billions of times, all equally real. I not only saw the facet of the Old Ehlnofey where I stood, but that of all of facets too. The reflections twisted and turned, wrapped in on themselves forever.  'Surely,' I thought, 'this is the Second Sun, where Anu dreams eternal.'

The citizens took their stand with their mirrored counterparts. It was quiet. Then all broke out in song. And the world was Honey, Color, and Light.
