On the Origins of the Esri: An Imperial Account of the Oceanic Nation of Esroniet

Marcus Veri 

4E97

It is common knowledge among Imperial Historians that the 284th year of the 3rd Era was eventful for the island nations of the Padomaic Ocean. What most historians blissfully ignore (in favor of the history of the Expeditionary Force) is the diverse history and culture of Esroniet, one of these island nations.

Esroniet is an archipelago (Author’s Note: if it can be called that) lying between the continents of Akavir and Tamriel; this is precisely what made it an attractive locale to Uriel Septim V. Few historians and chronologists ever set foot on the archipelago, as the land was rife with rebellion and unrest. The Esri, or people of Esrionet, are not easygoing folk.

(Author’s Note: At this point, I would like to indicate that most of this information comes from a distant predecessor and ancestor of mine, Mariano Veri. He spent three years living among the Esri of Blackharbor.)

Esroniet is populated by men with skin the color of dust and clay-filled sand. The Esri appear to be of mixed mannish and elven descent, much like the Bretons of High Rock; however, it should be noted that the culture of the Esri is nothing like what is seen on Tamriel.

The Esri worship a variety of deities, including the Daedra. Their principle deity is Hircine, the Daedric Prince of the Hunt. However, their devotion to their lord is neither blind nor salient; in fact, it almost appears muted and absent. Most people ignore their religion in favor of occupying their time engaging in debauchery. Rum, gambling, and smoking take up most of the Esri’s time. In spite of this, the Esri are excellent trading partners with the Dark Elves to the West. 

The flow of goods runs exclusively through Blackharbor in the Northern Island. Dunmer arrive in droves to Blackharbor, often filling up the port with dozens of insectoid ships. The Dunmer often trade their spirits or food for Esri weaponry and armor.

Esri weaponry is reserved for the elite of the noble Dunmer houses, as they are both expensive and prized. Esri weapons use a variety of materials to create weapons which are lightweight, flexible, and strong. Their armor is much the same; it has been said to be as strong as ebony but as versatile as moonstone. 

(Author’s Note: Because of the lack of information on the people of Esroniet, I find it difficult to transition smoothly to this topic, so I will delve into it without further ado).

The people of Esroniet are known for their slyness. Their cunning can only be Merish or Imperial in origin, but their lack of morality certainly does not stem from these roots. While an Esri shakes your hand and smiles, she will be hiding a dagger in her other hand. It is often these daggers are poisoned; many Imperial soldiers visiting brothels found their necks imbibed with the essence of Esri lotus and sumac. The Esri also are excessively formal with each other, not as a sign of goodwill, but as a method to flatter each other and rise above each other. The saying among the Expeditionary Force was that the Esri are quicker to the tongue than to the sword. However, this was entirely inaccurate.

The skin of the Esri is adorned in tattoos. Each one tells the story of their ancestry, or of great battles fought and won. No modification is done for aesthetics, as every drop of ink corresponds to a drop of blood either shed by the weapon of the person in question or their ancestors’. It is common to see tattoos around the eyes of the Esri, giving them an almost lupine aura. This, coupled with their bright, silver or green eyes, gives them a facial expression which calls back to the wild ferocity of the Esri.

All of this is inconsequential, if not for the mystery of the origins of the Esri. All these pieces of evidence form a larger fraction of a Dwemeri puzzlecube, never meant to be solved by Imperial minds (albeit tantalizing: who are the Esri?

Are they cousins of the Bretons or Reachmen? They do seem to resemble the Reachmen to a degree. But the latter is unlikely, as the Reachmen would never form a society so far from the wilds. 
Does their mannish blood imply Nordic or Imperial descent? Indeed, the craftsmanship of these folk might imply some Atmoran blood, but these people are far too uncivilized to be related to the Imperials or the Nords.
Could they be what is left of the Ayleids and their human slaves? This is a possibility worth exploring.

Seeking the answers has left me with more questions than I began with. I will set off to the sea to find the answers I seek, the answers my ancestor sought.

I will release an updated tome on this topic upon my return to Tamriel.
