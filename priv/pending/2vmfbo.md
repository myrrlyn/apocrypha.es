"Of course Torug!..Poor Torug..."
Malacath said to himself. He sat and slumped in his throne.Ashamed he had become so preoccupied with his own affairs, and the affairs of so many less deserving Orcs. For who was more deserving than Torug!?. A status he should not be denied a moment longer he thought.
Malacath sent out the word and beckoned Torug and all his kin to his throne room.They were all somewhat apprehensive at first.
When they were all assembled. Malacath sat forward on his throne and reached to Torug with an ebony goblet, the same he has used with Rukgor. Malacath looked down on Torug, looked at him straight in the eyes with an expression mixed of self abasement and pleading of forgiveness. The great warrior god was not without compassion, especially towards his own.
Torug surprised, unsure what to do, knelt at the top of the thrones stairs.
"Rise champion of the Orsimer, honour me, hear my oath then drink from my cup.." The audience then swelled with pride and joy.

"Chieftan! Torug gro-Igron!..Leader, visionary and champion of the Orsimer..Architect and protector of the first Orsinium!..Torug,he who fought the invaders of the first Orsinium. He who fought and bled and killed so many in battle in over fifteen years of warfare at the first siege. Fifteen years and ten days before he fell..And it took a flaming catapult to finally bring him down.. Henceforward any Orc that belittles or disrespects any from the line of Igron without just cause, must pay blood price!.Let it be known as a blasphemy!."
All Torug's kin were elated now, Torug himself somewhere between shock, awe and pride. Malacath then waved Rukgor over who had been waiting in the wings.He walked over with his grand spear held upright.

"Kneel to him boy.." Malacath said, Rukgor hesitated and gave a concerned glance.
"Kneel to him my son.." Malacath said in a low firm tone.The crowd gasped. Torug hardly knew where to look til Malacath caught his attention again,as Rukgor bent on one knee.

"Such is my shame, and my will to vindicate my trespass against you.Oh worthiest younger brother..." Malacath squeezed yet more blood from his left palm into the huge goblet. The size of a smaller cauldron, and placed it in Torug's hands. Malacath looked into Torug's eyes with only the deepest of respect and spoke.

"Drink of my blood, share in the power of my being. Become my true Blood Kin.."

Torug did so. The same that happened to Rukgor in the same ritual, happened to him. Once Torug was transformed, more or less an accentuated version of his former self in an aesthetic way. Spiritually heightened and granted with some divine insight and power. Malacath told Rukgor to arise and embrace his new brother. They embraced, one hand on each shoulder, and holding each other inward arm to arm in the Orcish way. Where Torug once stood forty pertans tall and weighed sixteen thousand angaids. He now stood one thousand and six hundred pertans high, and was forty two thousand angaids in weight, much the same as Rukgor. Torug had arrived in Ashpit, unabated and willingly welcomed by all into Malacath's stronghold including a grand welcome by his greatness, in IE 965, upon his death in Orsinium. Torug had cut Shinji, Shinji had cut him in the siege, but neither could duel undisturbed in the thick combat of it. 
Malacath had felt he had neglected him for an age or so, all the same. Torug had not been created like Rukgor, no. The Orsimer spirit mother, fertility goddess, midwife to the Orc, warrior mother. Patron of the Orcish female. Steward of the of the harmony between the Orc and the forests. Keeper of the good yield crop - GRAMUSHGA, made of sacred covenant between gods. Also another Daedra and a not Daedra. Thus not bound entirely of the constraints of Daedra. She put Malacath's celestial seed and her egg in the womb of the strong mortal female, Ogzala. Thus Rukgor was born.
Though Torug was no less a demi god than he. Torug's new flesh was formed the same way as that of a Dremora, previously.
Malacath much pleased, sat back and announced.

"Torug's sphere, is of 'The strong and wise Chieftan, great leader and protector of his kin to the end'.. All good chief's should look to Torug's example at least once, and revere him. As he deserves.."

Torug bowed his head. " You honour me great one."

The gigantic chamber with pillars came alive with ecstatic roaring and cheering, so raucous and heartfelt, the poor unfortunates outside wading through the sulphurous murk could hear it.
When the celebrations had finally died down, a single Orc called out to Malacath at the bottom of his stairs to the throne.

"What of Gortwog!?"

Malacath looked down with a slight wince of offense at the upstart. The Orc was scared witless upon realizing his own actions. Malacath leaned forward looking at the terrified Orc, with a dry knowing smirk. He said.

"We will see.."
