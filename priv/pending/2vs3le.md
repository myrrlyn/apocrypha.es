[Blackness. The void? Not quite, the void of a different kind. Cybervoid. A computer boots up.]

**[Voice]:** Begin Project REN0... Boot sequence- 1. Creatia Drive 2. NO Shield

**[Voice]:** Welcome, **King-Eternal**.

[A figure appears in the dark of sleep, or is it sleep? Is it a figure?... He speaks as if, bouncing ideas to himself, but you know he addresses you. Not you, but **YOU**, as **YOU** will soon find out. The Fourth Wall is quite intact.]

**[Unknown]:** I have seen... that {Parallel 1} has defeated Numidium. An... interesting achievement. Why is it called {Parallel 1}? You know the nature of Numdium. How many other {Parallels} are there? Two, you say? Two is an interesting number. A number I very much like... 2. 9 I like much better.

**[Unknown]:** 0 nullifies 1. Defeats it; *NEGATIVE*, **NO**. 2 however; 2 against 0 creates a resounding 1; *POSITIVE*, **YES**... What then happens when it is 9 AGAINST 0? Ah... now THAT would be very interesting to see... WILL be.

**[Unknown]:** No. There are more than 2 {Parallels}. Infinite... The number of **MAN**. The number of *POSSIBILITY*.

**[Unknown]:** You wonder who I am? Better to tell you the Hero of {Parallel 1}. --Jubal-- And Vivec. The birth of the new Amaranth of which not even I am privy to see. Ah, Vivec, my old friend. Where have you gone? You are not here. But why so different here? {Parallel 0} has not seen your radiance in... How long has it been? Numidium, you BASTARD!... I have searched for you Vivec.

**[Unknown]:** Vivec and and your lover --Jubal--... Such convenient resolutions to Numidium. I have searched {Parallel 0} and have found no Vivec or --Jubal--. You know why that is, although you do not yet know. {Parallel 0} is MAN's {Parallel}, of course....

**[Unknown]:** It is time to enact **PROTOCOL: 9 AGAINST 0**. I will brief you and answer further questions before you begin your mission. Oh and... welcome to {Parallel 0}, *Dynamis*...

[ A computerized voice begins speaking, uttering words from the figure's mouth]

*[Unknown]:* MODE SWITCHED TO INQUIRY RECEPTION-- BEGIN YOUR SESSION OF INQUIRY.

[The figure gazes back at YOU with a peaceful, light expression, awaiting YOUR questions.]

-----**Ren0- The Hero has Arrived**-----

**Scene: Nu White-Gold. A brilliant pure white shine amidst the dusty red salt flats of Masser. At the base, in remembrance of White Gold Tower of Imperial City, The 1st Void-Empire of Man (1V-E.M.) Counsel is in meeting.**

[The doors slide open and a shadow appears. Is this who the 1V-E.M. Counsel has been waiting for? There is astonishment all-around. There is only one way this figure could have bypassed the security of Nu White-Gold.]

**[Chancellor Festus Lux III ]:** Who goes there!? This is a sealed meeting! Identify yourself or I will personally combust your being and send it into the void above this tower where no one will ever be able to learn of the secrets you may have learned from this chamber!

**[Counsellor Jean Motierre]:** And I---

**[Festus]:** Shut up and sit down, boy! You would do nothing...

**[Unknown]:** You know why I'm here. Is Akatosh ready for me?

**[Festus]:** So King-Eternal Talos has sounded the final signal and brought the last player to bear... Yes, Akatosh is ready. What is your designation, Shezzarine?

**[Shezzarine]:** My name... is Dynamis... What of the other Divines?

**[Festus]:** The others have completed Mantling Process 4. They are in transit to their destinations now. I suppose time is short. We have prepared Divine Mantling Chamber 1-Akatosh (D.M.C. 1-Akatosh) for your use.

**[Dynamis]:** Time is indeed short. If you would but show me the way. I will need the full year of transit time to Mantle.

**[Festus]:** Of course, Dynamis. Welcome to Nu White-Gold. We all are very excited and prepared on this momentous day for what is ahead of us. You will be travelling to Akatosh aboard the Tower-Class Voidcruiser "SEPTIM", the flagship of the 1V-E.M. Navy. It is an honor to finally see you and realize our struggle is almost at an end!

[Dynamis leaves the counsel chambers headed for the docks. In the distance looms "SEPTIM", a voidcruiser as tall as Nu White-Gold itself.]

**[Motierre]:** Why did we not converse with him longer? I would have very much liked to invite him to experience the luxuries of Nu White-Gold.

**[Festus]:** You *Imbecile*! Quit your political maneuvering and stroking, you snake. No point in getting to know him well now if in one year he will have transferred Akatosh himself! I don't know why your spineless form is allowed on this counsel... If it wasn't for you long-standing family name...
