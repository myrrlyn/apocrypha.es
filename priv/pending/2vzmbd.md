SHEGG the MAD was in a burrow in the ground in the dark and he was laughing. He was laughing at the darkness and he was crying at the laughter. The darkness was laughing at the tears and at the darkness and at the MADman. 

And then there was a whisper in the darkness and a small thing wandered into the burrow and it heard the laughing and the crying and the laughing and it was scared. The small thing was a man and it was mad and the MADman saw it and he said HELLO to it and he smiled with his teeth. And the small thing was scared of the teeth and then its parts were all over the burrow and it was RED and the MADman cried and laughed and cried. And the darkness laughed and the small thing cried and the MADman cried and cried.

MAD MAD MAD MAD

And then there was a giggle and it was another small thing that wandered into the burrow and it was MAD and it was glad and the MADman laughed and laughed. The MADman smiled and he said HELLO and it said hello and he told it a joke. And the small thing laughed at the joke and it laughed and then it threw its parts all over the burrow and it was RED and it laughed the MADman laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed and. 

AND AND AND AND AND AND AND AND

And the RED was dark and it was despair and the RED was colorful and it was beauty. And the MADman laughed and cried and laughed and he looked at the burrow and he looked at His burrow and it was RED and RED and it was Despair and Beauty and it was His and none of it was grey and the darkness laughed and he laughed and he was the darkness and he was the MADMAN and he was in HIS burrow and from that day on he told jokes and he smiled with his teeth and he laughed and he cried and his name was SHEGG the MAD.
