*From a series of tracts stored by the Psijic Order on Artaeum. Taken from interviews with Ashlander Fishermen in the 2nd Era, who claimed to have been told this story by an intelligent Dreugh off the eastern coast of Vvardenfell. It is suspected that a more likely source of these tales are oral tradition dating to a pre-Tribunal Magnus cult operating on Vvardenfell.*

It was Shor, second only to Magnus.

Magus, father to all, who created the world, who by his design all live and all die. Magnus the King. Magnus the brash. Magnus of the all-seeing eye. Magnus the upstart.

Shor, the trickster, claimed Magnus's design as his own. Shor, who spread the lie of Nu-Mantia.

Shor, once benevolent and just. Once a paragon and example to all.

Now Shor, god of lies. God of slaves. God of tricks. God of betrayal.

Shor made great claims. Claims that he would steal Magnus's magic and grant it to the Vagrant Men. That Magnus's power would belong to all. These were lies. Shor sought Magnus's crown, and his glory. He sought to fell Magnus's great Tower, so that he might burn Lyg to the ground, and use the flames to bring about the end of days.

The Vagrant Men, orphans that Magnus and his People, so graciously took in, so they would no longer be forced to wander the seas on their rotting wooden ships. Shor told them that they were slaves, but they were not slaves. They were, however, primitive and stupid, and they trusted Shor, and so they trusted the lies of Nu-Mantia

Shor and and his wife Kyne, Queen of screams and goddess of cleaving.

They came upon Magnus in his great tower and thrust upon him.

But Magus knew of this. His Great single Eye saw all. It saw this prophecy, and Lord Magnus knew this  to be foretold, he knew it to be necessary. He saw that the crown of the King must be worn, and if not him, then Shor would be forced to don it, and that Shor too would bear the curse of Kingship.

As Shor's army of vagrant men, his kin, descended on the just and innocent Children of Magnus, so too did Shor and Kyne descend onto Magnus himself.

They tried to gouge out Magnus's great eye, but to no avail, as the all-seeing eye could not be destroyed. Magnus laughed at their attempts: “My eye is witness to the world, and a world unseen is a world that does not exist.” 

Then Kyne, wielding her great axe of lies, did cut around The King's eye and remove it from his socket, mutilating his glorious visage. Then, with his sling of lies, Shor flung the eye into the great seas of Lyg. The Children, seeing their god in pain, put down their swords. Ignoring the hordes of men, the Children raced into the seas after the eye. They would never find it, in time they would drown in lost ideas and would-bes. Their skin would turn to chitin, and the legs would split, and they would forever stay drowned in the abyss. The Great Eye would freeze in the cold waters of the shadow seas and on this ice would form a land of blood and hopelessness, and a great mountain of curses.

After this deed was done, Shor took Magnus's corpse and threw it into the sea. This force was so great, it ripped a great hole into the sea, and Magnus's divine corpse was shattered into 9 daughters, as his Magic spilled out.

With Magnus's stolen magic, Shor did light Jyg ablaze, and then consume it. Soon after, Shor and his cursed wife, with their army of raving men, would move on, so they might find another land for the false king to rule.
