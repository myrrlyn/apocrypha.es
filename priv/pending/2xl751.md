The following text was extracted from a poetry tome catalogued in the Dominium's Index of Banished Writs. As such it might well be the last of its kind. The author claimed it to be based on a true story.

&amp;nbsp;

*Son of Altmer mother,*  
*Yawns with joy, lying still*  
*Sleeps against bequeathed breast,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;

*Sun is out for us to play,*  
*Let us sing and spring and sway.*  
*"Watch me mother", runs to the mill,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;

*"Hold my hand, gaze at my face"*  
*"I'm proud of you, little pup"*  
*Toils against mother's disgrace,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;

*Bed of cobble, coat of rain*  
*Coughing out the remnants of childhood.*  
*Cowers and awaits the day,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;

*Within hunger, eating away*  
*Golden pride lies now dun*  
*You were lucky I found you that day,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Castaway from childish dream*  
*Sleight of hand let's you survive,*  
*Trying to remain unseen,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;

*War is here,*  
*They need your hands,*  
*Rise up to your emperor's call,*  
*Aegis of your land so bold,*  
*You had nothing, they threw you a sword,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;

*'Tis not your war,*  
*You're a hound 'gainst thine brothers,*  
*You're from nothing, but fear they take it,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;

*Gold turns crimson*  
*Life is rent,*  
*When in war they need you most.*  
*Stands now proud, in his war tent,*  
*Captain Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;

*Dusk is here,*  
*And so they came.*  
*In the field you are a flame,*  
*Bleeding out, red heart, white-gold,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;

*Son of Altmer mother,*  
*Life escapes, dying still*  
*Rots against earthen breast,*  
*Little Yonnir of Bravil.*  

&amp;nbsp;
