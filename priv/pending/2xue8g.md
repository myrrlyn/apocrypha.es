Little piece of apocryphal mythos I came up with after all those talks about Dibella.

"Why does werewolves skin-change under the moon?" That question is frequently asked and has no actual answer. However, it's known (though not widely), that in several places in North-western High Rock werewolves are believed to be spawns not of Hircine, but of rather obscure goddess named Laviagna (or Zavyanar or Ã°lovjana depending on the handwriting of the scribe or amount of teeth of the person, from whom you came to know about this deity). She is called the goddess of moon, mysteries, wisdom and nightly predators such as owls and bats. Many scholars equate her with either Hircine or Azura, however, some time ago at the Ayleid's archaeology site in the Transniben there was found a bas-relief, featuring similar a woman alongside with both gods, believed to be Daedric Princes of Hunt and Borders. After that Gwylim University asked for assistance from Mythogeneasophists of Altmers and got an unanimous answer: in several Apocryphas Jode is a deceased sister of Azura and spouse of Hircine; she is said to create the flower lov'yar, which grows only on a small patch of soil on Summerset, open its petals only at night and is prized by alchemists for its intellect-strengthening effect (and by necromancers for it's a vital ingredient in several rituals). If that's is true, Hircine in fact may have closer ties with moons than we thought. And still, the only known temple to Laviagna is little shrine in Imperial city. Of course, if you don't believe her to be the personification of cat-mer's Riddle'Thar. Whether she has faithful among were-creatures (or other abominations such as victims of Noxiphilic Sanguivoria) is unknown.
