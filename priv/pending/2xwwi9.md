**The Gwylim Praxis**

by the Aureate Serpent

*Methods of draining magicka from intelligent creatures at the moment of death.*

________________________________

Following the Pretexts of Dark Magic, a more delicate appraisal of the more obscure arts of “Dark Magic” is thus required.

Long has it been theorized that Aetherial Magicka is but raw, untransmuted creatia of the beginning place. The yolk of the First-Egg that has yet to be shaped by those that speak the language of dead names. This magicka enters the Mundrial plane through the Suns and Stars punched through the Void and finds purchase in those whose own divine spark resonates with similar frequencies.

I speak, of course, of the spark of sentience within intelligent creatures that not only provides a semblance of the divine spheres that preceded mortality but also provides that spark of creativity originally inherent within the darkest corners of that pantheon. For without creativity, would the various schools of magic even exist in any recognizable fashion today? Through the imagination, the secret door within the void of our own shells, we may fashion the most simple defensive wards to the more complicated conjurings of inimical spirits more commonly reserved to the fire of the left eye.

The Eastern mystics of the Bitter Well unleashed this school of magic upon the Mundus and it is from them we learn the methods.

METHOD THE FIRST: First used by vampires who have fallen out of the world and feed upon mortals through cracks in the firmament. Tendrils of void-magic reach through into the world whilst mortals slumber and invade their dreams in Vaerminic semblance. Any mortal who suffers such an infliction eventually falls into a coma which inevitably leads to death. This is the slowest and most succulent fashion of draining mortals of magicka.

METHOD THE SECOND: Lost since the days of the Potentates.

METHOD THE THIRD: This method may be purchased and learned from a variety of spell vendors and shoddy peddlers of scrolls. Indeed, it is the easiest way to drain magicka from a mortal, even unto death. Insofar as its potency, it is but the weakest method known.

Was that delicate enough?
