After several days of warmer weather, when the people of Winterhold woke up yesterday they were facing frigid temperatures, blizzards and another day of closures at the College of Winterhold.  The decision has reignited the debate on the College's cold weather policies.

Assur Korirsson says closing the College for cold weather is teaching local children to give up in the face of winter, which is harmful to passing on Nord values.

"Young Nords need to learn to hunt in any weather, not just when milk drinkers feel warm enough," he says. "Bad enough that those damned mages fill Winterhold with Elves, and now they want to turn our youth into weaklings!"

The College closures have been a hotly-debate issue in local inns and taverns.  Some say the College needs to reflect the values of Skyrim.  Others say that after the tragedy with Altmer College member Nirya, it makes more sense to keep the College closed during blizzards rather than force people to traverse a treacherous causeway in the middle of a storm.

"With the growth of the College, it is simply no longer possible to house all our students and members within the College itself.  Not all our members can endure the cold with as much fortitude as Nords," says Master Wizard Faralda.  "The safety and well-being for our people and all the people of Winterhold is always our first priority."

This is the eight time that the College has been closed this winter.
