*This scribbled poem was found pinned to the remains of the Temple door in the ruins of Balmora, upon the first attempts at returning to Vvardenfell after the Red Year*

---------------------------------------------------------------

Walls did crack and waters tremble,

In Thousand Lanterns Way.

And with a splash, the ceiling caved,

To let in the light of day.

*'The end is nigh! Look to the sky!'*

The frantic screams did say.

For fire, ash and Mountain's stone,

Had swept the sky away.



Balmora burned, the Odai boiled,

The foaming waters rushing in.

Our secret markets, halls and homes,

No longer were, but had been.

The water rose, and fears too,

All prayed to deities three.

But few were heard, that death of days,

The Mountain knows no mercy.



I sit here now, midst rubble and Red,

My fate to die, no doubt.

Balmora and the Lanterns Way,

Scorched and black throughout.

I hear a voice, a scream, a yell,

A desperate, helpless shout.

As one by one, those Thousand Lanterns,

One by one, go out.
