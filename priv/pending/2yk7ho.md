With the Stormcloak-Imperial war going on, there has been much academic discourse on war, politics and religion. However, amidst all the chatter of Skyrim independence and Nordic tradition, the author is of the mind that the Empire at large has forgotten something.

What's most interesting here is that despite the focus on the fictionalized accounts of Tiber Septim being a divinity, the Daedra have found a way to worm themselves into this issue.

Reliable, anonymous accounts have made talk of secret sects of Malacath worshipers existing within Tamriel's Imperial Legion. To be sure, the numerous orcs working as soldiers and smiths worship the Spurned Daedroth openly, but these particular cults is mostly comprised of Cyrodiilic and Nordic adherents who, despite not being outcast (except perhaps as a result of their odd faith), identify with the story of Malacath.

The author has collected no less than fifteen different accounts from multiple cults, but the underlying assumption is the same. The myth of Boethiah eating Trinimac is a metaphor for the transformation from Man to Soldier. 

Initially, Trinimac is depicted as a cowardly, arrogant figure: the association with elves is given emphasis in most variations (as the author learned one black eye later). Nevertheless, Trinimac possesses redeeming qualities (strength, valor and a limited amount of courage), just qualities overshadowed by his ego and his distaste for hardship. When Boethiah consumes him, he is thrust into a conflict between himself and Boethiah's energies which culminates in him ripping himself from Boethiah's stomach (some say after three days) and being reborn again as Malacath. Trinimac's transformation into Malacath is seen as a positive thing, strengthening his positive traits and eliminating his weaknesses.

The symbolism here is obvious. Initially a cowardly, inexperienced civilian who has a limited set of traits that are necessary to become a soldier, the Malacath worshiper is thrust into a state where he can either adapt to a radically changing environment or die. After long periods of hardship, the soldier emerges from the ordeal stronger and better than before. It is easy to see why the emphasis on Trinimac's experiences while being consumed would resonate so deeply with the soldier, who risks dying every day of his life.

It is known that there are multiple orders (the most sophisticated having seven), that a communal meal is shared in most and that all women are barred from entering in every one, but aside from that nothing is known. Presumably, this is because of the stigma against Daedra worship in the pertinent regions of Cyrodiil and Skyrim. Research is currently being undertaken as to the views of Orcs on these mystery-cults.
