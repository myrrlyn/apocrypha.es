*To Magistrate Raneem,*

*With Dark Anchors casting long and terrible shadows across the Alik’r, I understand that the citizens of Sentinel might, in their desperation, turn to the gods - even the outsider gods of the Easterners - for salvation in these days of crisis. Still, by Ruptga, it should be obvious that engaging in debauchery and base hedonism will not provide us with a solution to our collective anguish! 
I deliver to you the enclosed flier, plastered to the side of my house in the early hours of the morning.
Magistrate, I beseech you to do something about these “Pursuers of Dibellan Arts”. Surely, this sordid little society will only make matters worse for our great city in these troubled times!*

*Yours respectfully,*

*A concerned citizen*

&amp;nbsp;

**All are welcome among the Pursuers of Dibellan Arts. We convene monthly on the night when Masser is born anew. Should our tenants pique your curiosity, seek us out at our next soiree. We yearn to make your acquaintance.**

&amp;nbsp;

### Tenants of the Pursuers of Dibellan Arts

**Seek pleasure in all things and help others do the same.** 
 
**Champion the Arts. A life without creation is merely existence.**  

**Bed only those who wish to be bedded.**  

**Let not prejudice limit your palette. Beauty can be found in all peoples.**  

**Eat well and eat fine. Nutrition fuels passion.**  

**Protect the beauty of the natural world, for the Mundus is Dibella’s flower garden.**  

**You must love yourself before you can love others. Self-respect is key.**  

&amp;nbsp;

Walk always with beauty and grace.
Dibella guide your hips, my brothers and sisters.

*Cyrene at-T’wala, High Laying Sister, Sentinel Chapter*
