*As told by the Dweshillibi Ashlander tribe*

The other tribes have forgotten, but we remember. In the days before Red Mountain, when our pantheon was eight and one, the houses of Veloth were united and prosperous. Each house had its specialty. None were like us in our magic, for we understood all its forms. House Redoran mastered muscle-magic, House Telvanni star-magic, House Hlaalu word-magic. Dres knew the magic of Molag-Bal, Dagoth the magic of Dagon, and Indoril the magic of Azura. We Ashlanders have always known the magic of surviving where others cannot. But House Dwemer mastered the music-magic, the most powerful of all.

Yes, of the original Eight Houses, they were the most advanced. They burrowed deep into the mountains and found the heart of Lorkhan. The Velothi took this as a sign of confirmation, for then we knew we found the DAE BAL as promised by Veloth. And there was no Chimer house greater than the 8th, House Dwemer. They and Indoril competed for glory and there was much honor blood between them.

When the Northern Men came, we were laid low. We were pushed off our lands and served as lizards to the whims of those with Loudest Voices. They shouted our metal-men to pieces and pulled our spiders apart with their hands. Yet, while the rest of us toiled in bondage, Dwemer was unaffected. They survived by going even further underneath the hills, beneath the ocean. There they found the secrets of time and motion and came up with a plan to drive out the invaders.

Meanwhile, Azura spoke with Nerevar Moon-and-Star. She told him the time had come to cast off the yoke of men. She said the men of the dragon had done the same to their masters. She would not let the Chimer be outdone. She led Nerevar and Voryn Dagoth to Red-Mountain and took him to Dumac and Kagrenac. He then beheld the fruit of their labor: Anumidium. 

Nerevar brought his chief strategist with him, Seht of the ruined house Sotha. When Seht saw Anumidium, he fell to his brass knees and declared "Thus mer has made God and become God." Nerevar chided him for his blasphemy, but Dagoth and Kagrenac thought he was right. Kagrenac spoke: "This is what Veloth was building towards, the path laid out for us from days long ago. Thus I present to you, a new Anu based on Velothi principles: the brass-heaven that walks through time."
