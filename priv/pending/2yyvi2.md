**Introduction**

An Empire is only as powerful as its citizenry, and when Emperor Tiber Septim wisely supported this publication, he showed that he recognized this vital part of good governance.

Bringing children into this world is a risky endeavour from beginning to end; from mothers birthing in tents in a blazing hot desert or fetid swamp to the loftiest turrets of the most opulent palaces, childbirth, much like death is a great equalizer.  All classes and races were plagued with issues of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity.

Research is conducted by physically travelling the length and breadth of Tamriel to learn the most recent techniques and discoveries made by birth-givers and their attendants.  Trust has been built between these communities over generations of communication, and where some groups were at first much more hesitant to share their secrets of survival with the world, they now eagerly share their expertise with the itinerant midwives.



**Preparing for Birth**

In the weeks leading up the anticipated delivery, a safe place to labour is of utmost importance.  If home is not safe, no Temple will refuse a labouring woman, and they almost always have a healer available.

It is very important to have a skilled birth attendant.  There always will be skilled midwives in Temples of Mara or Arkay.  There are often experienced midwives at Temples of Dibella, Julianos and Kyne.  As for other Divines, there is a possibility but it cannot always be relied upon.  In most cases, particularly if the mother is anxious, it may be best to bring one's own choice instead.  Mages Guild Halls and interestingly, Thieve's Guild Halls often have competent birth attendants available as well.

Skilled midwives are easily found almost anywhere in any town or city.  With the exception of the Khajiit, race does not confer too many advantages, as unique skills can also be offset by unique hardships.  If the midwife was trained in the Temple of Arkay or Mara, it is certain they would have researched the most up-to-date techniques on birthing.  Many other midwives do their own research and are just as qualified as our priests and priestesses, but the mother must diligently question their candidate to ensure they are receiving the best possible care.


**Pain Relief during Childbirth**

The basics of pain relief in childbirth are startlingly similar across Tamriel, potions to bolster stamina and a few to ease the pain of contractions.  Pain relief taken by mouth is generally seen as risky and has been associated with unpredictable effects in mother and child.  This is mostly due to weak alchemy skills, so if the mother is interested in pain control delivered by potion, it is best to verify the credentials of the alchemist.

Magic in childbirth is similarly risky depending on the midwife's skill.  Some healing spells cast at the wrong time can stall labour.  Calm spells are always safe, however.  If the mother is interested in magic during her labour, she should speak to previous patients of the mage.  If there are no previous patients in her area, the mother should think twice about engaging in their services.

The safest and most effective pain relief comes from the Khajiit.  They are able to administer highly purified potions directly into the pain centres in the spine, removing the pain, but allowing the labour to proceed more less as it should.  The skills required to do this are highly specialized, and only a handful of non-Khajiit have been allowed to learn the techniques, and are fobidden from teaching them.  These skills are also quite common inside Khajiit society itself, and with forward notice, it is not difficult to find a compassionate cat who will administer the relief at a fair (to them) price.


**A Complicated Birth**

Sometimes things to awry in childbirth, and there can be no preventing it.  In many cases, regardless of their place in this world, mothers and infants die.  If birth takes too long, it can become extremely dangerous for mother and child.  There used to be very little that could be done that would save both lives.

Except among Khajiit.  Mothers and kits still die after complications of birth, but their rates are far lower than every other race of the Empire.  The Khajiit have a way of removing the infant surgically without killing the mother.  It is a highly sophisticated procedure that is only available through the Temples of Arkay, Mara and large Khajiit Caravans.  The procedure is always completed in a Temple, and only Khajiit are capable of performing it.  No Khajiit has ever been known to pretend to this great skill, the consequences are reputedly to be dire.  Therefore checking credentials is not required if the candidate is Khajiit.  The pain relief method mentioned in the previous section is always used, as well as many restoration type magicks.  Full recovery can take a year or more, though many mothers recover faster.

The procedure is very expensive, but the poor are given a surprisingly equitable price.  It is often surprising how quickly they are made available, once the Temples or Caravan are told of the emergency; however sadly, their services cannot be guaranteed to be available in all areas.

**Caring for Baby**

While the milk of the mother, or of a wet nurse are obviously the best choices, sometimes that is simply not feasible to provide.  Infants require high levels of nutritional value and purity in the milk they drink, and they are very vulnerable to disease and poisons that exist in sub-par milks.

Temples of Mara and Arkay often stock small supplies of Yneslaic Yak milk that has been processed in a highly specialized manner that creates an extremely nutritious and safe food for the infant.  Through the Temples, a price for a regular supply and delivery can be negotiated at a fair price.  Suppliers can also be sought at markets throughout Tamriel, although only reputable merchants should be used.  Penalties for counterfeit baby milk are harsh, but there are still unsavoury types who would take advantage of a young parent.

Milk from other bovines that have not received the secret Echmer process tend to yield sickly children and great care should be exercised when giving them to the infants.  Sheep and goat's milks have somewhat better outcomes, but nothing matches the outcomes of children fed the Yneslaic product.
