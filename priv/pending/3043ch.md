*By Titus Pompeius, 4E 214*

By the time Riften was occupied by the fourth legion in the spring of 4E 201, the Imperial organisation had changed dramatically. The lack of professional soldiers had forced the General assigned to Skyrim in a time of Dragon and Dragonborn, Tullius, to recruit locally, and those brought under the Mede banner were much more rabble than efficient. This was mostly due to the breaking away of most Imperial provinces after the Great War, which had crippled the Empire and left it under the White-Gold Concordat, leaving a loyal few in Skyrim, Cyrodiil and High Rock with the role of provision. Additionally, the Imperial economy had also largely declined, and much of their uniform had become cheap leather, abandoning the heavy and sturdier steel designs of the past.

As a result of all these respects, tactics had also changed. In the past, the Empire had been equally famed and feared for their vastly superior organisation. They relied strongly on versatile heavy infantry, consisting of frontline warriors and nimble mages. Supporting cavalry would also be present, normally recruited from Nordic ranks, but sometimes others, depending on allegiances and the situation. Beware the Imperial cavalry of guar composition!

To elaborate further, the Imperials had broken their foot soldiers into groups, seven men deep and ten across in a checkerboard formation, so that they would remain organised but also highly flexible. They were known as maniples, due to the banner each group would carry into enemy lines. Heavy soldiers would rely on a short-sword for quick and elegant stabs, a body-shield fashioned in a nostalgic allusion to the Chim-El Abadal providing body protection atop the iconic Imperial dress. Imperial mages would be more versatile. Before physical engagement, they would line the front, harassing the enemy with destruction and summoning magic, along with archers and skirmishers. When the enemy finally impacted, the lighter units would fade through to the rear, the warriors allowing them passage. Here they would fight around the sides of each maniple, refusing the enemy themselves to come in casting distance, should they conjure a storm of teleportation spells or general destruction. Cavalry would also play a role in keeping any would-be routers at bay, while attempting to route the enemy themselves. If needed, they would also play the role of general pre-battle harassment, armed with ranged attacks themselves.

But by 4E 201, this had become radically different. Not only had the general professionalism of the army dropped noticeably, but their attire was much less protective. The strong lack of professional mages due to the disbandment of the Mage Guild (its predecessors were much more interested in competition than military duty) and general lack of recruitment also led to a lack of ranged support. The maniples, as a result, became strengthened more-so in depth, deepening from seven men to nine to account for the less powerful heavy soldiers. The mages, in addition, now almost entirely composed of Breton and Imperial recruits, were retired to horseback, where they would fill in surprise and skirmish roles in contrast to normal cavalry, who would task themselves with oppositional and defensive routing matters. Only archers now filled the ranged main force. Where the Empire had once concerned themselves with sheer force and discipline, they now relied on sly tactics to conserve a weaker constitution.

But to return to the Rift, where birch trees now began to blossom with new life, and the undergrowth wiggled through melting snow, Tullius had a plan. Most imperial forces had been on the defensive during this time, and up north, Ulfric pillaged the lands from Downstar to Whiterun. To neither side could the Dragonborn give aid, for he had been missing for some time along with Alduin. But as for rebellion, Tullius had given them courage, and now he was going to shatter it. In taking Riften, he had done so in hopes of surprise and disarray. He had taken it upon himself to force-march his offensive assets from Solitude to the borders of the Rift in a number of days, tasking his mages to task speed and endurance spells en masse, killing all spies and scouts in his wake. He sent no envoys. His enemies would have certainly caught ear of his plan, but they would never be able to act fast enough. By the time he set up his first camp directly outside Riften, its residents were in total shock. Panic spread like wildfire, and before a supporting force could lift the unexpected siege, General Tullius took the timid city with no remorse, permitting his soldiers to sack, pillage and rape as they pleased. After the ordeal was over, all local keeps were pacified of brigands and subsequently occupied. Soon the Rift was an Imperial hive. Here, the empire prospered, as during this time, a factor most armies had to take into account was a dragon assault, and the empire was efficiently dispatch of such foes here, and using magic and physical constructs, they would be constrained for a time after temporary death.

As would be expected, such barbarism and total destruction would be greatly condemned by the Stormcloaks. But as Tullius no doubt considered, the act would also be taken with a hint of suspicion. And so, many of those front-line rebel garrisons stayed up north in apprehension, leaving a force directly from Windhelm to march down south, as Tullius had hoped. Tullius had also hoped Ulfric would lead the charge, as not only was he present there at the time, but lifting a city debauched by Imperial barbarism would be a massive source of propaganda. However, much to the disappointment of Tullius, Ulfric Stormcloak did not lead the charge, and instead left one of his most trusted officials, Arrald Frozen-Heart.

It is at this point, when both armies dispatched their abodes and descended into the volcanic depression of Hjaalmarch, that the Battle of Prisms was set in stone to play out. It is so aptly named, for the prismatic springs of that inhospitable place were said to be ringed with blood for years to come.
