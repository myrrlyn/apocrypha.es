A scribbled note found forgotten at the Imperial Library next to a pile of several books of esoteric content. Sent to you in consideration of your interest in the ravings of madmen.

-Eborus Evangilus

*The rose that WAS, in the box that WAS NOT, do you see now the beauty that is divine defiance?*

*To put that which IS(and by extension also what can be seen and known) within that which WAS NOT(or no more) but IS(and always was, but not) all the same(which of course, can not be seen) creates the illusion that may even trick the divine.*

*The Master who forged it never was, and they(all of them) were all the same, so the box is, but is not! Do you see it now? Do you see the dominance of what both IS and IS NOT may hold over that which simply IS? How existence sprung from possipoint erased might cause such disturbance that IS and IS NOT is blurred together into the temporary UNpossipoint(do NOT confuse with IMpossipoint, but that is of course clear)?*

*IT was all there within that box but it WAS NOT all the same, thus IT was SEEN but then also UNSEEABLE. For how many dragons I am not sure, but clear is that it calls for NOT so strongly, that it erases IS but the box never WAS, yet IS. IT is Denial in purity.*

*Do you see now the beauty that is divine defiance?*
