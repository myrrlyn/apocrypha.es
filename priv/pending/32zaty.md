**Dated:** 4th Era 169

*This dossier is considered top secret and only to be viewed by his eminence Lord Naarifin and his lieutenants.* 

**Description:** Heretical Knightley and Monastic Order

**Background:** This group’s original incarnation can be read in an history of “knightly” orders of the early 3rd Era, our focus is on its resurgence in 3rd Era 433. During the Oblivion Crisis several chapels in Cyrodiil were apparently attacked by Umaril the Unfeathered, of Late Ayleid Period fame. His return could have exploited more if the Thalmor had come to power earlier, but the Great Anguish required all of our machinations in order to successfully save Alinor. It is reported that this group of knights formed around a figure whom they dubbed, “The Divine Crusader.” Cults of Shezzar in Cyrodiil still rave to this day that this figure was the reincarnation of Pelinal Whitestrake, whatever the case was this Crusader was somehow able to defeat Umaril and returned to tell the tale.

However, at the beginning of the 4th Era, this Crusader figure seemed to have all but abandoned this group of so called knights. The group has carried on since then and still fancies themselves a highly religious order. Their numbers have remained low since the turning of the age, but pilgrims still make treks to visit the Priory. They still maintain residence in the Priory of the Nine, mere leagues from the Valenwood border. 

**Operational Notes &amp; Planning:** Now some may consider this dossier a waste of ink, certainly this group poses no threat to our invasion plans, and their sad devotion to the ideas of knightly chivalry and honor are antique and overly romantic at best. What we do not take lightly is their heretical worship of the false god Talos. While their veneration of the other divines is of little concern, their title of “Nine” is an affront we will not tolerate. Our esteemed leadership of Alinor has decided to make an example of these heretics playing knights, one that will not be forgotten. The plan is as follows:

After the Dominion makes war upon the Empire, our armies will make a diversionary attack into Cyrodiil to tie down the Imperial Legions and prevent them from reinforcing Hammerfell. We shall task one of Lord Narrifin’s sub-commanders (*of his choosing*) with leading a small force to the Priory to eliminate these knights. Militarily they pose little threat to our forces, yet this operation is solely based upon ideology, and one we can afford to undertake. We will show all men that we shall exterminate this heresy wherever we find it. After the order is eliminated, the Priory shall be razed to the ground, pulled apart brick by brick. Nothing shall remain to remind the people of whom those stones were dedicated to. (*Note: These plans are subject to revision and expansion as the situation develops.*)
