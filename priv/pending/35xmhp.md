*To the esteemed College of Whispers*

*Greetings, I am Lady Aliria Laurent of Daggerfall, an artifact collector as with most of my great family.  I write to this most respected establishment to inquire a matter of interest, it is with great hope and appreciation that I hope this College could answer.*

*Three fortnights ago, I was exploring the ruins of an Ayleid city when I found a most peculiar object. Supposedly, according to the inscriptions on various signs and tablets, the city used to house many daedra cults, which might explained the few daedric runes. Regardless, the object I discovered seemed like some sort of decorated soul gem, colored black, attached to a device or an altar of sorts. My clumsy manservant Ribbons ( I don't know why I keep him, his family has been serving mine for countless generations, but each is more incompetent than the last) triggered some sort of trap and an ethereal spirit appeared from the altar.*

*Whether it is a real Ayleid spirit as it claims to be or a unfunny practical joke left by the mages exploring the ruin before, the spirit spoke of being a daedric cultist long ago, before the fall of their civilization. When I asked why it chose to remain in this soul gem, he told me his tale, the spirit was a magicka practitioner worshipping the daedric prince of Meridia, although not a wholly evil daedric prince, he later came to regret the decision. When death was fast approaching his weakened body, he found a way to trap his soul in this device to escape the fate of being passed onto Meridia's realm of Oblivion. He also recounted that some of his friends and companions, who were Aedra worshippers, also tried to escape the fate of the divines claiming their souls, although some ultimately failed in their endeavors.*

*I have heard very little regarding the subject, and was very much curious to learn more about souls passing to realms other than the Aetherius. And during my research, I found an individual of most particular interest to me, and that is the recent legend of the Dragonborn, the supposed dragon trapped in the body of a mortal. Living in Glenumbra and far away from the lands of Skyrim, I have acquired little of this Nord legend. I am writing to the College of Whispers to inquire about this particular case.*

*According to my rather limited research, I was given to understand that the Dragonborn was blessed by Akatosh and therefore he would have the greatest claim to the Dragonborn's soul, however, numerous rumors that reached High Rock claimed this person also came into contact and possibly aided several Daedric princes, and it is possible that they would have a claim to his soul. And, according to my conversation with the spirit, the fate of one's soul can be determined by oneself if he is sufficiently powerful, of which I am assuming the Dragonborn is.*

*So, I propose my question, would the soul of Dragonborn go to Akatosh, of which the Dragonborn owns his birth right to, any of the daedric lords, of which the Dragonborn has made a conscious choice of, or to his very own desire?*


*Thank you for your patience.*



*Yours Truly*

*Lady Aliria Laurent, Daggerfall*
