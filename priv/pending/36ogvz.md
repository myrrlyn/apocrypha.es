*Just Because They Don't Want You, It Doesn't Mean We Do*, by former Narzulbur Gatekeeper Borag gro-Gamot

Serving as the Gatekeeper for the Narzulbur stronghold in Skyrim's Eastmarch was the most impactful part of my life yet. Being home to one of the most prosperous Ebony mines in all Skyrim, there was never a shortage of greedy bandits ready to underestimate the strength of the Orsimer. Many weak men and mer alike fell at my hammer's swing, and I was honored several times for my courage in defense of the stronghold by Chief Mauhulakh. But often I was faced with task of keeping out visitors and solicitors, if you can imagine that. What could the Orcs of Narzulbur possibly need that we did not have means of getting already? But, I digress. Many people approached our gate, and many were turned away, even Blood-Kin. With my time as Gatekeeper having come to an end, I bear to all people one simple message from the stronghold Orcs across Skyrim:

The Orcs might be outcasts, but we aren't some refugee camp.

I don't care what you have for us. If you don't belong in the stronghold, you don't enter the stronghold. As Gatekeeper, I am tasked with permitting all recognized Blood-Kin. That is, non-Orcs given the blessings of another Chief or Gatekeeper. I know the faces of all recognized Blood-Kin, and you cannot fool me with magic either. I am also tasked with denying disgraced Blood-Kin. Criminals, heretics, and other disgraced Orcs are not allowed in the strongholds without expressed permission from the Chief. If there's a bounty on your head and they let you into Largashbur, that doesn't mean I'll let you in. Especially if the bounty comes from Eastmarch.

And I don't know how things work in Windhelm, but if you find yourself outside the city walls, I don't care if you can mine Ebony for eight days without stopping, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED IN THE STRONGHOLD UNLESS YOU ARE BLOOD-KIN. When Dunmer parade through the Velothi mountains, we are not their rest stop. If they need supplies, they can pay for them and move on. If you're looking for work, either prove yourself worthy of the honor of Blood-Kin (to be decided by myself or another Gatekeeper), or look somewhere else. There are plenty of mines in Skyrim. Shor's Stone is just a few days toward Riften if you've got a horse.

And NO you cannot stay the night inside the walls. We owe you nothing, travelers. Do not expect anything from us. We appreciate your threats, and look forward to meeting your "dangerous friends" in combat. The Orc strongholds are for Orcs and recognized Blood-Kin, no one else.
