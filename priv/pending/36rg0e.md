*Chaos, entropy, corruption, degradation, damnation, such is the lands of Tamriel, the Arena, the land of eternal strife, the kingdom of wars and decay, but this, this blasphemy is not descriptive of the lands of Atmora, the lands of eternal winter, the ever frozen.*

*Some say Atmora is a land without time, without action, those who subscribe to such nonsense are not sharpener than those who created it, Atmora is not the freezing wasteland of Skyrim, of which the Nords call home, it is not a floating frozen mountain, but rather, a land without decay, without entropy.*

*Glass shatters, edge dulls, water drys, meat decays, snow melts,plants withers in the lands of Tamriel, decay, degradation fills the world, chaos reigns supreme, were it not for the caring of men and mer, our legacies would have crumbled eons ago. And yet, in Atmora, it is not the same. Shattered pieces find themselves together, separated splinters rearrange themselves, blades need no sharpening, wounds need no attending, game need no preserving, plants need no water, even the ice themselves do not melt, they chill and freeze.*

*Separated from Tamriel long ago, Atmora was a land of chaos, Atmora was broken, sundered, shattered, ruined. In time the lands began to heal itself, not through the power of man or mer, but the rules of Atmora itself, rather than enduring entropy like Tamriel, it went backwards, it reversed. What was broken is now whole again, water solidified and frozen to ice, withered plants grew and prospered, rottened carcasses became fresh again, and seemingly so full of life,  wounds healed themselves, and the land is whole again. Such is the power of defying the stride of entropy and decay.*

*This is the lands of Atmora, and the sides that is unknown to the denizens of Tamriel.*




*Unknown*
