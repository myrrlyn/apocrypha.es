*Gangs and Syndicates of Tamriel: Part I, an Introduction*

*By Wolfgang of Northpoint

There are a number of different criminal elements across Tamriel and have been since times long, long past. The travelers of Tamriel who were not lucky enough to have been born into money and may afford armed retinues see highwaymen and bandits as just so, as one hardly stops to reflect whether they are being waylaid by those belonging to the Renrijra Krin of Pelletine and Anequina or if their home was the victim of the Banaar Sasra in Hammerfell. The criminals of Tamriel are varied from province to province, and is an interesting study in both High Rock and Morrowind, especially. The Camonna Tong and the Morag Tong are but a few of the different organizations that carry out illicit activities- illicit almost always being in the eye of the beholder, who is almost always a Cyrod- and while they both share the designation of Tong, it is not to say that they function on the same level of legality. Much to the dismay of some of the Imperial authorities who tried to bring Morrowind into the Imperial fold, the Morag Tong was one such organization completely sanctioned by the governing body of Morrowind as a means to avoid large-scale conflicts among the Great Houses. The Camonna Tong on the other hand are more akin to the more commonly known Thieves Guild, although they differ on their stance on killing.

This is not to say that crime and criminals should be taken lightly or the lives of criminals be glorified and romanticized as is the case with  Maribelle of Daggerfall’s poem *The Highwayman*, where the person who is the subject of the poem is made out to be a gentleman-desperado who seeks vengeance against the cruel King’s men for killing his beloved tavernkeeper’s daughter. More often than not, as is the case with some bandits in High Rock, Cyrodiil and Hammerfell, the reality of being an outlaw is much less romantic and much more gritty. It is a world full of betrayal, violence, depravity and unforgiving ruthlessness. It is to say, that outlaws are anything but gentlemanly. In my travels, I have lived with and interviewed some of the more receptive syndicates and brigands, and it should speak to the reader that I did not attempt to seek out highwaymen or bandits. Where my work is very exciting with nary a dull moment, I can also say that there were many times where I thought I ought to rethink my path.

In the end, if I had decided not to brave the perils of the criminal underworld so you should not have to then this world would be founding wanting for a book detailing crime, criminals and their syndicates and gangs. I am hoping that this book and its chapters help not only give the common folk a glimpse into the world of rough and mean vagabonds, but to also give the many city watch members among Tamriel a knowledge of those they may face. After all, it was the famous Tsaesci warrior Sevik Chai, who lived during the time of the Potentate, who said that to know one’s enemy is half the battle.
