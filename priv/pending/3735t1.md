*Man builds and furbish, Mer destroy and annihilate.*

*Atmora Froze and Aldmeris Sundered.*

*[Atmora, the ever-frozen land, far to the north, endured no such thing as decay or chaos](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/36rg0e/atmora_the_land_frozen_in_time_a_description_and/), the same can not be said for the land of Aldmeris, the land of the mer. Aldmeris was land of ever-changing, no objects, no ideals, no concepts were still, all of which change, evolve, corrupt and decay, so much so that there are those who believe Aldmeris simply did not exist, however, that notion is as tedious and as idiotic as the concept of Atmora being frozen in time*

*Aldmeris used to be whole, used to be united, just like when Atmora was sundered and crippled, but unlike Atmora, which healed and prospered, it went on to experience decay, degeneration and damnation. The chaos it underwent was no ordinary one, such destruction put even the deadliest, most harrowing, most distressing wars and rebellions on Tamriel to shame, ocean dried, glacier melted, metal rusted, building crumbled in the span of few days, ideas died, concept torn apart, the willpower of the people sundered, Aldermis, appeared almost like an endless city, built upon itself over and over again, until nothing from nature remained. It was as if  the time was moving faster than usual, but alas, it was not. It was simply the laws of Aldmeris, just like the laws of Atmora*

*Soon, the lands of Aldmeris was torn asunder by the chaos, by this rapid entropy, not through the hands of mer that dwelled there, but rather, the land itself. Like the first man from Atmora who came to Tamriel from their cold and bitter lands, the mer of Aldmeris, now shattered into different groups, arrived, too in Dawnâ€™s beauty. From two ends of the extreme, these man and mer came to the lands of neutrality, to Tamriel, but carried within them, are the memories of their home, in the vein of every man, there is the will to rebuild, to preserve, to refurbish; flowing through the blood of every mer, there is the urge for chaos, destruction and decay so that the world might reborn and begin anew.* 

*Such is the lands of Aldmeris, the land of ever-changing and reigning chaos, and the mer it bred*
