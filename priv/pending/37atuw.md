*Dearest Llenwey, I miss you already. But I do not think we will be apart much longer. I can't tell if this is the Temple of Dibella or the Shrine of Sheogorath. I'm the first initiate in three years, and I can see why. There's this... This young girl, probably about 12. She always stays in the Inner Sanctum and Mother Hamal is constantly tending to her and teaching her the ways of the Dibellan priestesses.*

*You might be wondering why this is strange. I did not find it strange at first, either. But this girl... Mother Hamal says that she can commune with Lady Dibella herself! Not only that, but when we perform the Communing Rite, the girl's eyes begin to glow with a purple light, and her voice... Her voice becomes that of a woman, no longer this young girl. If a voice could be beautiful in and of itself, this is what it would sound like, Llenwey. There's also an unsettling amount of power in it, benevolent as it may be. Do you think it could really be Lady Dibella speaking through her?*

*Now, I know what you're thinking. Why is this upsetting me? Surely I can tolerate these things when only done during the Communing Rite? Well, according to Mother Hamal, the Communing Rite is only for us to converse with Lady Dibella. She could speak through the girl at any moment! And what's worse, I was speaking with her not long ago about where I was from as I was cleaning the Inner Sanctum, when suddenly she froze. Then her voice changed as it does during the Rite, and she began to sing in the most soothing tones I had ever heard... It felt as though I was melting in the sound, and when she ceased, the whole room was spotlessly clean. I am still not sure what happened, and I am not eager to find out.*

*If something else happens in this same vein, Llenwey, expect my return within mere days of my letter about it. This place is both beautiful and terrifying, and I do not think I can remain here.*

*With Love, Maravel*
