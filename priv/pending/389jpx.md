Entry: Songs of Red Eagle, performed by a Reachman bard in a Markarth tavern


It is difficult to place when exactly the two-part instrumentation archived within, musically representing the life and death of Faolan, better known as Red Eagle, cultural hero of the Reach, was composed.
Educated guesswork puts the songs' composition sometime in the late Third Era, between 3E350 and 3E368, when Tamriel experienced renewed stability and prosperity under Emperor Pelagius Septim IV. During this time, citizens of the Empire were able to move freely throughout the provinces, the Reach was calm and, under Jarl Alfred, a moderate and progressive leader (of mixed Nordic-Reachman blood), native culture entered a renaissance. A wave of new art and music was produced by Reachmen, depicting Reach-native history and lore. The pair of archived songs, listed here, dedicated to Red Eagle offer an example of this cultural boom in the Reach.

The first piece, [The Red Eagle Flies](https://soundcloud.com/rcarass1/the-red-eagle-flies-1), tranquil and optimistic, represents the birth and rise to prominence of Faolan, the young warrior-king, who would unite the fractious clans of the Reach and lead them to prophesied glory.

The second piece, [The Red Eagle Falls](https://soundcloud.com/rcarass1/the-red-eagle-falls-1), mournful and brooding, represents the later years of Red Eagle's life; his exile, the sacrifice of his humanity for the wild and dark power promised to him by the Hagravens, his campaign against the invading armies of Cyrod Empress Hestra and his eventual fall in battle.
