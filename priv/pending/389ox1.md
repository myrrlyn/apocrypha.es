Dear Arngeir, Head of the Greybeards,

I hope this letter arrived to you safely, I know that the 7,000 steps can be a dangerous task.

I have always wondered what your opinions are on Tiber Septim. I know that you believe that the power of the Voice should be used as a means of violence only as an absolute resort, and I also know that Tiber Septim led the invasion of Old Hrol'dan to conquer High Rock using the power of the voice. And yet, you (or your predecessers) called Tiber to High Hrothgar to train him.

How is it that you could have trained someone such as Tiber Septim, who had violated the Way of the Voice, teachings of Jurgen Windcaller? I cannot help but notice the hypocrisy. 

My next question is this: you had told Tiber Septim that he would one day rule all of Tamriel, but that he would need to wage war south to do so. This "prophecy" came true, and so it seems that you and your order have some connection with seeing the future. And yet, you call the Elder Scrolls "blasphemies" for doing the exact same thing. I cant hope but notice the hypocrisy in this as well.

I hope to hear back from you quite soon, thank you.
