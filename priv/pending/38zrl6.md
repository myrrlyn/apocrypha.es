45th Raldbthar, 1E635

The expedition has been a great success! The temperatures are intense, but the suits are helping massively! We have detected a massive amount of Krkhegth in the area, more than I’ve ever seen before as a matter of fact. I’m sure we’ll find something down here.

*Note: Krkhegth seems to be some kind of measurable energy that the Dwemer used. Perhaps Mana?*
