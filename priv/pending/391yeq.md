I SEE THROUGH MANY FACES
I SEE THROUGH MANY EYES
I AM OUTSIDE LOOKING IN

EACH TIME WE MEET 
YOU DO NOT KNOW ME

I AM THE SHARMAT

YOU ARE THE DESTROYER
HERE TO STOP MY TRUTH

MY INFINITE ARMS REACH INTO MANY SLEEPERS
AND THEIRS INTO MANY MORE

YOU CAN NOT STOP ME
YOU CAN NOT DEFEAT ME
AND IN TIME
YOU TOO WILL SING WITH ME
