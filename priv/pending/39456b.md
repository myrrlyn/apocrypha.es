50th Raldbthar, 1E635

Yagrum says that this expedition is a waste of time, and that all of the Krkhegth is nothing but the heat of the lava affecting our instruments. The animunculi are starting to malfunction due to the heat. I have a feeling we canâ€™t be down here much longer without a bigger expedition team. I wish more architects were here to back me up on the pursuit of knowledge, yet all I got was Yagrum, a mere engineer, Nchuadk, a spellblade, and a Falmer slave.
