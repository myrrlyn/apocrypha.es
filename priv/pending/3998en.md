63rd Raldbthar, 1E635

We found it! The source of the Krkhegth! It’s the heart of… something, although definitely powerful, whatever it is. We’re calling it The Radac, in honor of the greatest weapon smith of my era. Even Yagrum seems to be impressed. Now we don’t have to worry about getting back to the surface, the sheer amount of Krkhegth that Radac is producing seems to stabilize the lava, turning it to stone right before our eyes!
