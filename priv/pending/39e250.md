65th Raldbthar, 1E635

I had to do it! With them out the way, I can finally become Chief Tonal Architect of the Dwemer! Yagrum escaped through a portal to Oblivion he was making for us to get out, but I’m sure that he’ll get captured by the daedra and killed. I kept the slave alive, because I can’t just take all of our supplies to the surface myself, can I? I will have to kill him when we get to Arkngthand though. It should be easy to get out of here with Radac in my pack, I haven't seen any lava anywhere, and the only thing that's telling me that we aren't in a regular cave is the heat.
