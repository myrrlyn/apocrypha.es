*A brief excerpt from a treatise published by the Imperial Order of Blades on Dragon Hunting methodology, intended as instruction material to be used in the training of prospective Hunters*

...thus, before devoting himself to the study and practice that this Order has espoused for generations beyond memory or record, the aspiring Hunter must first abandon all preconceived notions regarding his foe, the Dragon. 

Although tales may abound regarding the powerful creatures known also as Wyrms or Wyverns, few are wholly reliable in their depictions; first and foremost, it must be understood that the Dragon is not a dumb beast, dominated by instinct and a hunger for flesh. The Dragon is, rather, marked by vast intellect, honed over centuries of survival. The Dragon may speak, may plan, may deal: more than few have sought protection behind the word of Kings or lesser Lords, pledging service or wisdom. However, it cannot be forgotten that the Dragon is irrevocably marked by a compulsion to do evil, and thus should not be wholly trusted. 

Further, it must be understood that the Dragon is unequaled among all the beasts great and terrible that roam or have ever roamed these lands. Clad across its form in thick scale, most arrows loosed or arms thrust against it will fail to draw blood. Gifted with great wings, it may take to the air for advantage in battle or escape from certain death. The power of its tail is greater than any bludgeon, the strength of its maw enough to tear men apart with ease. Of these great advantages, however, none compare to the Dragon's innate magical ability to summon from its jaws unyielding torrents of intense flame or frigid gale. It is this that makes the Dragon a terrible thing to behold, for with a single exhaled breath it may raze an entire village or boil hundreds of warriors clad from head to foot in steel within their armor.

For these reasons, it is of utmost importance that the Hunter never underestimate the Dragon: it must always be kept in mind that the Hunter may swiftly become the Hunted, and just as swiftly become the Dead. There is a strength in number, but a mass of flesh and steel provides to the Dragon but a larger target. Swiftness in action is wise, but a lack of preparation, failures in planning, or sloppiness in execution dooms a Hunt to failure. Courage is necessary, but overconfidence and brashness spell certain death. The wise Hunter springs his trap and kills the Dragon before it is given a chance to fully realize its demise: the doomed Hunter faces the Dragon openly in combat.
