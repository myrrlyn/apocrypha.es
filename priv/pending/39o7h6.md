I keep asking myself the same question over and over again. Why do we want to achieve divinity? Our brethren, The Elves Above, want to achieve divinity because they believe it is their destiny, that they were originally divine. But why do we want to achieve it? To be above something?  But above what? Maybe we wish to achieve divinity to see what the world truly is, maybe we wish to prove to all the races that we are better that all of them. Maybe itâ€™s as simple as the fact that we are too scared to die.

What I do know is that I must use Radac to power the Numidium. But not for the purpose that it was originally built for. How can we use it to fight wars when we know that it can be used for so much more? I know my destiny now, and it was right in front of me the whole time. 
I must reshape the world to what it was in the beginning. And I must use the Numidium to do it. I must fix the grave mistakes of the Gods of The Elves Above. I must make the Numidium to unmake the world. It is my destiny,
