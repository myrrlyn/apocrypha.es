58th Vrythgr, 1E637

Our brethren in Skyrim want to know what we need the core for. Unfortunately, no one has found any aetherium anywhere else in this realm. We’re willing to give them resources, but they persist on knowing what it is for. I know that they’re in a lot of trouble with the High King trying to wipe them out, but we can give them weapons and Animunculi! I’m going to have to do some tricky negotiations if I’m to build this core. Or perhaps attempt a riskier solution like using an alloy to make the core, even if aetherium does manage to reflect the least resource-heavy tonal vibrations when used with the right ad’eic focus core.
