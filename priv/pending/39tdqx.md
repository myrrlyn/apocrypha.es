I wrote this as I was thinking about Ysmir and his various incarnations, and decided to write it from a narrow point of view of a Nord. This is just for fun, enjoy~

___

And Ysmir descended upon the Nords, guiding his people east to war, to leave trails of blood behind them as they take Resdayn for themselves. All who cross their path are left in pieces for their false gods to pick up, neither the elves of the deep, nor the elves of Veloth can stop them, not even when united as one.

It is not till the Elves of the Deep have disappeared, and the elves of Veloth are cursed with their new skin that 3 new gods emerge from the center of Red Mountain. The new gods, ALMSIVI, kill Ysmir again, who is the Ash-King, and cannot die. The nords have taken a large amount of old Resdayn, now renamed Morrowind, and claimed it for themselves, for it is the land of the old-gods, and is to be protected by those who claim it by rightful rule

Ysmir is reborn again as hero of the Nedic peoples, tribes before the time of Cyrodiil, and assists Lady Alessia take the center lands for themselves. He dies, and turns to ash, for he is the ash-king, and cannot die. He is reborn anew in the third era, friend of Tiber Septim, ruler of kings, king of kings, taker of all. He then is tricked and becomes Talos, with his friend and battlemage.

He is reborn again, to save the lives of the northern peoples, and all other as well. He battles Alduin, father to the Ash-King, and banishes him to whence he came. The Ash-King dies again, but turns to ash, for he is the ash-king, and cannot die

He sleeps, awaiting to be called upon again.
