63rd Vrythgr, 1E637

The core has arrived, now to send them their Animunculi. As much as I hate giving up so many weapons due to our conflict with the Elves Above, I donâ€™t want to lose such a valuable resource as the Aetherium Forge. Numidium is almost complete, and now with the core to be placed tomorrow, it will be only a couple of months until it is completed.
