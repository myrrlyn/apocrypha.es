*Greetings, humble reader! I am Lucinius Flacchus of the Imperial Geological Society, 4E206.*

*This is An Argonian Inquiry, a comprehensive investigation into the lands of Black Marsh and it’s indigenous population. I intend to keep these short and concise in individual additions, but overall adding to something more substantial. Not many documents have been written on this place, and I have taken it upon myself to travel east and explore it myself. So like many fabulous narratives, we must start from the beginning.*


To discuss the nature of Argonian religion, I managed to corner an Egg-Tender named Weeresi, and he agreed to speak for a time on the subject. He reluctantly told me of a creation myth synonymous between the majority of tribes in the Black Marsh. They all believe that the Hist – a sentient tree species that they claim heritage from, came from the Remembered Place. Sithis, the primal force of Change, close behind. Around them developed an un-cracked Egg we now know as the Aurbis – what they call the Unnumbered Egg, or perhaps the Egg of Unknown Gradient, my terrible Jel does fail me. From here, the Hist became implanted into a developing landmass that became Tamriel, and the reborn Seth became the Striking, the Argonians the Hist. But I am afraid, concerning more than this, the Elder was despondent. 

Mono-mythically, I can make comparisons. The religions of most cultures comprise of a dualist relationship, that much I know. Sithis, or the primordial Seth as the Saxheel say, is clearly a chaotic force, the Hist perhaps somewhat static from their defensive and conservative nature, although I am unsure. Perhaps this relationship does not exist in their case? But alas, Mystery is something the People of the Root revere. 

Of course, Mystery itself is unknowable, a force we know from Azura to some complexity, but to the oscillations of Creatia it must be more. From what Weeresi told me, Mystery is what the Hist don’t tell of their origin from the perhaps ironically named Remembered Place, so the Argonians utilize this not only as a weapon but also as a shield. But to much annoyance, the Egg-Tender refused to elaborate. And so again did I investigate from a different faucet. 

Of all, the Hist of Black Marsh are perhaps the most mysterious. As my dear reader may know, these sentient trees are what the lizard people revere above all else. They claim that their soul will return there upon death, and that from the roots they will be born again. They are not only seen as a teacher and provider for the Root People’s prosperity, but also a vessal. The Hist absorbs from the world around them, a being of renewal, knowledge and power to their children. They drink magicka from the place we know as Aetherius, and drink Memory from below – as the Egg-Tender told me proudly. But they themselves are also dependent on the Embodiment of Chaos. 

While Sithis is regarded by most cultures as evil, to the Saxheel he is the Giving and Taking Father. To the common scholar, it should be well known that the Serpent constellation creates the Shadowscale order under its shine, a direct connection to Sithis by the Hist. But Seth is much more than that. To the Argonians, he brings “The Striking”, a static change, coiled potential that makes the weather, specifically precipitation. To the Hist, this weather and swamp currents give them power. It also keeps the swamp a moist and humid place. He also governs the growth and spread of animals and plants, so he is held in high esteem during harvest and hunting seasons. In contrast however, he is also a force of punishment. When one is killed in the wild or war, it is the doing of Sithis. Indeed, the waters and rain can also become floods and great storms, ripping up towns and flora indiscriminately. Thus, the Argonians view the mortal life and indeed all “Life Phases” as a challenge. A challenge of acceptance by their Father and to some “Final Goal” known as the Exact-Egg Cracking, an escape of some kind. From the Aurbis? That is all he said on that subject, and much to my disappointment, it seems he had enough of me by then. 
	
Indeed, especially for an outsider like me, Mystery is a translucent veil through which I can only guess forms, and so I must leave my thoughts and speculations on religion here. But do not be disappointed, my dear reader and hypothetical compatriot, for in two days I see a tradition known in Tamrielic as the Naming Day. And what an excitement that will be!
