It seems that tapping the heart will take more than expected. Btharmz went to Arkngthams-Brthngz to try to tap into the heart with one of the machines that he built. Arkngthams-Brthngz was completely destroyed by the pure Krkhegth that radiated from the heart when it was tapped. Iâ€™m going to have to do some extra research, it seems.
