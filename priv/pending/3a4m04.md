It took me a whole 20 years of endless toiling at the {Earth-Forge?}, but I managed to make the tools! I haven’t tried them yet, but I’ll have to do to later, apparently there’s some turmoil with the local Chimer at Endusal. Dumac is worried that the Chimer know what we are doing, since Radac is n Endusal, as is Numidium. I’m going to have to start bringing the tools everywhere with me, since Dumac is worried that the Chimer are going to start a war.
