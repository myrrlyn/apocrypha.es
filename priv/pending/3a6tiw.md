Ulfric blinked, wondering if the moment was real. To his left, the unconcious form of Jarl Elisif lay behind her throne, surrounded by his Stormcloaks.

The stirring under his boot assured him it was. He looked down to the bruised and battered form of Tulius, who still managed to look surly and defiant despite the amount of blood he'd lost in the fight.

"Do it, traitor of men." The imperial spat out the words with a spray of blood onto Ulfric's boot.

"Sovngarde awaits you Tulius, you fought well, but on the wrong side." The Nord said, sliding the blade of his sword into the General's neck.

Tulius coughed once.

And then he laughed.

*Traitor of men*

The words echoed in his mind for what seemed to be an eternity, when he was pulled out of his reverie by the sudden change in pitch of Tulius' laugh.

He refocused his eyes back on the face of the general... but it was different now.

The graying hair of the aged general had gone a deep golden blonde.

His skin was no longer the light olive tone of an imperial, but into an almost glowing golden hue.

His brown eyes had shifted to bright green.

And his ears had become those of a mer.


"All men will die. And it will be your fault."


The din of battle began to roar around Ulfric, and the stone floor of the Blue Palace was replaced with mud. The walls were gone, and a stiff breeze blew across his face. 
He turned to see Lake Rumare... and the outstretching heights of the White Gold tower.

All around him, imperial soldiers were being cut down by Aldmer warriors. The battlefield was littered with the corpses of men, and it was clear to see the battle was over. It was now a slaughter.

Ulfric watched in paralyzed horror as he saw men fleeing, fighting, and ultimately cut down by mer. The corpses were numberless, and they all had the face of Tulius.

*Traitor of men.*

He felt a sharp pain, and looked down to see an elven blade piercing his gut.

The golden face of an Aldmer sneered in his face. "We can't thank you enough, Ulfric."

He fell to the ground.

And as his sight began to fade his last vision was of a woman. She stood upon the corpses of the men as if they were a pedestal. 

She wielded a staff adorned with skulls and writhing serpents, and had eyes of burning crimson.


*Traitor of men.*
