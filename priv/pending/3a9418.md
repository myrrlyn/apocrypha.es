50th Raldbthar, 1E670

The war has been going for 2 years now, yet there is no success. I can’t test the tools since Dumac thinks it would be safer without the Chimer knowing about them as well. We hid them at our base of operations at Red Mountain, with Radac; I’m going to have to wait for this war to end to use them.
