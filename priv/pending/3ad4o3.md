23rd Krgthand, 1E700

30 years later, I finally have time to write in this journal. About 28 years ago, the Chimer found out about the Tools, Radac, and Numidium. One of our “colleagues” at house Dagoth decided that he wanted to help the Chimer, and thanks to him, the Chimer are fighting twice as strong. We’re sitting in some sort of small room. They dragged us here in the middle of the night, and i have no idea where this is. We’re losing. The Chimer have taken most of our territory. Luckily, they’ll never find the Numidium, but I’ll have to try to convince Dumac to get to Red Mountain while we still have a safe passage and use the tools. This is our only chance at winning this war.
