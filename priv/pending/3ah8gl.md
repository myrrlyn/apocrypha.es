30th Krgthand, 1E700

When I was young and first found the heart, I was just daydreaming about me becoming the one to make our race gods. But I realize now that my destiny is much more important. I’ve tried to explain this to Dumac, but he doesn’t want to hear any of it. No matter. I will make sure that Numidium will walk Nirn and destroy all that was not meant to be there. I realize now that this world was just an accident, and the entity that created it sent us to fix its mistake. From the beginning, our affinity to magic, our skills with machinery which overcame the other races by thousands of years, and last but not least, me finding Radac, were all there to help us fix its mistake. It all led up to this moment. I can hear the screams of mortals all around me. I am unsure whether they are Chimer, Dwemer, they could be Bosmer. But it doesn’t matter. They are all suffering because the Entity made a grave mistake. ~~Our race~~ *I* am destined to fix it. If anyone ever finds this journal, then I have failed the Entity, and his Mistake still exists, and all of the races are suffering for it.
