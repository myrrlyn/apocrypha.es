Before recorded time, before the First Empire was founded, while the ancestors of the Dwemer were just settling the lands to the east, there were the Aldmer. They were the “First Ones”, the ancestors of all of the true mer of Tamriel. They first settled on the two islands that we now know as “The Summerset Isles”. They were led by the great King Sindil, who led them to Tamriel from their now-abandoned continent, Aldmeris. Here, on Alinor, they settled, and life was modestly comfortable. The crops were prosperous, and they worshipped their ancestors, like the modern Dumner do.
One day, during the summer, a hunting party was traversing the dense jungle of modern Valenwood. The hunting party consisted of King Sindil, his personal guard, Orminaro, and his only son, Soliantar. They were walking down a path, their bows drawn, when they heard a deer in the distance. They started to run towards the sound, their footsteps as silent as a Khajiit stalking his prey.

They ran into a clearing, where they could see that the deer was nothing but spirit. Suddenly, they were ambushed by tens of other spirits of what looked like Aldmer, with their bows made of oak. The hunting party had no time to react, and the Orminaro fell instantly. Sindil told his son to run. Unfortunately, Soliantar was not the bravest Aldmer that walked this land, so he of course, ran. He could hear the distant sounds of battle as he ran towards the ocean, suddenly hearing no more sounds from the direction he ran from. He jumped on the boat and told the men to go. As they were rowing towards the ship, he explained everything that had happened to him and his hunting party, and in tears, told them that his father was dead.
He attended the mourning ceremony as the last member of the royal family, and in tradition, one year later, at his 40th birthday, he was crowned king of the Aldmer. The first law that he passed was the illegalization of the worship of Ancestors. However, after realizing that he could not worship his father, he decided that it was only allowed to worship the ancestors of noble heritage.

An Aldmer dressed in green silky robes walked into the palace courtyard, and saw Soliantar sitting on one of the benches, throwing bread at the fish in the pond. He strode up to him.

“Soliantar, are you insane!?” – He yelled,

“Good morning to you too, Nelendor.” – He answered back calmly.

“Do you realize what you’ve done?” – Nelendor was speaking in a quieter tone, after realizing that some guards were staring at him. He was the king’s personal advisor, but that didn’t stop the guards from arresting him for shouting at the king.

“Do you mean the outlaw of the worship of the spirits that killed my father?” – He mumbled back, clearly disinterested in the conversation. – “Nelendor, I know that you have good intentions, but all of the advisors have been on my back today about this and I just want to get some peace.”

“Soliantar, outlawing the worship of Ancestors means that you cannot worship your father!” – Nelendor was getting slightly annoyed at the young king’s incompetence, although he would deny it if asked. – “And he wasn’t killed by spirits! We asked him and he said that they were attacked by some bandits!”

The King rose up so suddenly that Nelendor almost fell back into the pond.

“**YOU DID WHAT?!**” – He shouted – “You dared to summon my father without my knowledge or my consent?!”

“My lord…” – Nelendor answered back, weakly.

“You and the rest of this damned council will be publically executed for worshipping ancestors!”

“My lord, please! I did not mean any harm!” – Nelendor gasped, terrified.

The next day, due to protests, the execution was aborted and the council escaped to the Isle of Artaeum, realizing that the King had gone insane, and to escape any further attempts at execution. They later became the Order of The PSJJJJ, also known as The Psijics, the greatest guild of mages in Tamrielic history.
