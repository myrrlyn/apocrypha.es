The following is an excerpt from "A guide to Imperial Class Structure", commissioned by the Imperial office of Census and Excise to offer information on the various official class designations a citizen may register as. Sections cover the profession and craft each class may offer. A series of scenario questions are also included that may ease the identification process if needed.

On the way to the Thousand Temple District of Cyrodiil City from the waterfront I stopped to browse the temple bazaar. There, under a tunnel of silken canopies, crowds of street vendors gathered to sell their wares.


A Dunmer man advertised a saint-card honoring Saint Jiub while a mage in a moth-patterned robe juggled fire near the All-Saints Inn. By an alcove, a Nibenese woman could be seen preparing a [sacred tea from the flowers of the Canticle tree](http://img10.deviantart.net/2bde/i/2012/150/8/8/sakura_tea_by_satoshi_hotaru-d51o0ug.jpg) beside tapestries of embroidered ancestor silk.


As I passed food vendors conjuring scents of [stuffed Blackwood banana leaves](http://finedininglovers.cdn.crosscast-system.com/BlogPost/l_7556_banana-leaves-meatball.jpg) and fried heartland rice, I was drawn in particular by the smell of incense to a candlelit alcove stall where a conjured scamp beat a drum. The trade stall displayed enchanted goods in various forms. Bowls of burning incense hung from the ceiling, and bands of incense sticks were laid out on display shelves. Near the center sat a [Nibenese sorcerer, leaning on a shield he had presumably enchanted](http://www.uesp.net/w/images/0/09/OB-class-Sorcerer.jpg). Curious in Nibenese class structure myself, I asked about his vocation. The merchant invited such discussion with some tea.


As we shared ginkgo and ginseng tea from [Cheydinhal county tea estates](https://rafrogblogus.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/turkey-tea-estate.jpg), we discussed the art of sorcery and its role in Nibenese society. In Nibenay, sorcery is an ancient and valued aspect of magecraft perhaps even predating the role of the battlemage formed under Ayleid oppression. It is an art that blends the honored virtues of mercantilism and magical prowess. Sorcerers are artisans of enchantments and conjuration. Like the battlemage, a sorcerer may hold political power such that a Cyrodiil magistrate may study the arts of a sorcerer to solidify power as per this Nibenese virtue. Sorcerer-ministers have historically held claim over Nibenese land. 


When engaged in combat, a sorcerer makes a powerful combatant. Besting the most well-equipped fighters, they rely on a focused branch of magic to snare and stun opponents with crystaline shards. Sorcerers train endurance; building bodily stamina that grants a capability to wield armor and equipment they enchant. Oftentimes a sorcerer is accompanied by a conjured Deadric auxiliary.


Most sorcerers for craft are aligned with the Mage’s Guild for distribution of enchanted goods and scrolls, and a sorcerer’s talents in conjuration play an important role in summoning days for those allotted services of the guild.
