I'm Lariul Valeius, former Imperial Archeological Society member and explorer throughout Tamriel. I hope this guide will be of use to any travelers who find themselves in the Nibenese east of Cyrodiil. I won't be covering any of the major cities, as this guide focuses on many of the less covered but largely important inns and villages to stop at on the roads between.


**Aleswell**


Aleswell was once a garrison settlement and fort mostly lost to the Interregnum. Up the hill from Fort Caractacus, the Aleswell of today is built from the stones of the old garrison. As the name implies, Aleswell is known for its ale, which includes a unique heartlands rice ale that I recommend.



**Weye**


Given the number of commuters that cross the Talos Bridge daily, some may consider Weye its own district of Cyrodiil City. The town of Weye is home to many fishermen and farmers of the Rumare. Weye's agriculture and fishing industry feeds a sizable number of the city's population. The fishermen and fishmongers of Weye make a living selling their catches in the markets of the capital across the bay. The fishing docks are quite large, spanning from near the Talos Bridge to the ruins of Fanacasecul. The Wawnet Inn is an ideal resting spot for those seeking entrance to Cyrodiil City. Though there is a bit of a markup due to its proximity, the Wawnet is still cheap in comparison to the inns of the Imperial Isle. The publican, an Altmer named Nerussa, has an impressive collection of wines from all over Tamriel.




**Pell's Gate**


Pell's Gate is a small rice farming village near the southern banks of the Rumare, southeast of Weye. It consists of stilted shacks suspended over flooded rice paddies painted red by the tinmi soil of the shore. Pell's Gate is named for an ancient landmark the settlement is built around, a large monument-gate built in honor of Pelinal Whitestrake. The Sleeping Mare inn offers food (mostly rice, don't expect much variety) and rest for travelers and merchants at a fair price. The settlement is just south of the old Homestead ruins, and close to Sardavar Leed where Saint Alessia lived under Ayleid oppression, and Castle Alessia built in her honor.




**Faregyl Inn**


Run by Khajiits, the Faregyl Inn offers boar, tea, wines, and a decent bed not too far from the Inn of Ill Omen on the Green Road. I recommend Faregyl over the Ill Omen if you don't mind spending a bit more gold. Faregyl has some history behind it, as its stones were once used for an interregnum era fort that was lost to its many battles.



**Inn of Ill Omen**


A poorly named inn on the Green Road, but it's not as bad as it sounds. The name represents its theme of atmosphere, reinforced by the sign's imagery of a raven. There are some small rooms that are as cheap in quality as they are priced. The food is mostly boar and rice, and the bar is stocked with some West Wield wines.




**Water's Edge**


Water's edge is a small farm settlement on the road to Leyawiin. There's no inn, and it doesn't have much to offer for travelers, but it is close enough to Leyawiin that reaching the village wouldn't warrant a stop. A path behind the town leads to Border Watch.




**Border Watch**


The Khajiiti village of Trariraj is known to Cyrodiils as Border Watch. The name caught on in recent years with the acquisition of the Trans Niben from Elsweyr. As the Cyrodiilic name implies, this village now sits close to the current Cyrodiil-Elsweyr Border. The Border Watch Inn is known for its cheese. Near the bar counter, the inn houses a famous 'cheese museum' displaying all kinds of rare cheeses in cases. The inn offers a daily beer from its brewery.




**Blankenmarch**


A small Niben village with old Kothri roots. The current population preserves the tribal tradition and superstitions, including the tendency of using Tiger Lilies in attempt to ward off the legendary Inverse Tigers. There isn't much to accommodate travelers, but the surrounding jungle has plenty of Ayleid ruins to explore.




**The Drunken Dragon Inn**


An inn off the Yellow Road. The rooms are twenty drakes, and the food is decent.




**Imperial Bridge Inn**


Past a wooden bridge spanning the Silverfish River lies the Imperial Bridge Inn, offering a cheaply priced bed in the attic. The food is served by a Dunmer woman, and is composed of Niben cuisine with a few Dunmeri touches.




**Harlun's Watch**


Just outside of Cheydinhal, on the top of a hill, rests the village of Harlun's Watch. While the small settlement lacks an inn, there is a tea house that overlooks the Harlun Tea Estate on the hills, and the Reed River below. The estate mostly grows ginseng, and the tea is quite good, but don't expect cheap prices.
