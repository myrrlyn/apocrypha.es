Hey /r/teslore!

I'm TakadiurgaUK_AUS or otherwise known by my TES name, Aberthol Windrime. I've recently established the idea to create a fully fledged basic guide to the Elder Scrolls. I'm using my physical copy of *Tales of Tamriel, Volume 1: The Land* and the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages, to create something which those who are new to The Elder Scrolls franchise would be able to use to get a fundamental understanding of key lore.

Now, due to myself being the only individual working on the aforementioned guide, I'm one hundred percent sure I will make errors along the way! That's why I've posted this thread for discussion ideas and for those who are wanting to provide constructive criticism, to where I've missed a point or gotten a fact wrong.

My current ideas for chapters within this guide are;

History (Synopsis of Era's Dawn through to IV)

Races (General Information, History, Pantheon's, Special Abilities)

Geography (Maps, information about Provinces)

Important Creatures (Dragons, Daedra, Monsters) 

Important Individuals (Tiber Septim, Ysmir, Emperors)

Important Groups (The Psijic Order, Dragon Guard, Dark Brotherhood)

Notes (Crap I haven't put together or found a place for yet)

So, without any further delay, I present to you my in-the-works link to [A guide to the Elder Scrolls.](http://1drv.ms/1fASKqs) Feel free to laugh at the abysmal condition it is in at the moment :P Post ideas below! I would love to hear them!
