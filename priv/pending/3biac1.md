This report will list the events that proceeded over the year 4E1267, during the invasion of Akavir by the Thalmor Army.

Part 1: Pre-Invasion

After the success of capturing Thras 12 years ago, the Thalmor felt that they needed to expand their forces to other continents to expand their Empire. The planning for the invasion of Akavir began in 4E1258, and was set to the highest of priorities in 4E1261. A simple version of the plan is as follows:

1.	The Royal Thalmor Army is to let the New Thrassian Militia, consisting of mainly Bosmeri troops, take control of the peace-making in Thras.
2.	The Royal Thalmor Militia, under command of General Urecalmo, is to organize an army consisting of, as follows:
•	2000 Nordic Warrior-Slaves
•	2000 Redguard Warrior-Slaves
•	1000 Imperial Mages/Specialists
•	200 Khajiiti Captains
•	10 Dunmeri Generals

3.	This army, known as the Distraction from this point, will be set sail from the port of Necrom, and during the voyage, all of the human slaves will be hypnotized with Illusion magic from the greatest illusion mages in Tamriel, into fighting for the Altmer without hesitation.
4.	
5.	The Distraction will circle around Akavir and await further orders from the Army near the Tang Mo
6.	The Thalmor Royal Army and The Thalmor Invasion force will set sail to port of the city Septimia. There they will set up a base of operations and communications. 

7.	A week before arriving at Septimia, The Akavir Invasion Force will contact the Distraction Generals and order the attack on Tang Mo

8.	After the Distraction has captured the Tang Mo, if the Tsaesci are not alerted, the Distraction will be ordered to proceed to enter the lands of the Tsaesci, where they will attract the most attention.

9.	Using the Dwemeri Animunculi Army Force and the invaluable knowledge from “Report: Disaster at Ionith”, the Thalmor Akavir Invasion Force will capture Ionith and proceed to capture the Capital of Akaviri.

10.	The Thalmor Akavir Invasion Force will not attack the Ka Po’ Tun, and will instead send the Animunculi and a collection of 4000 troops to the Distraction, and will assist them in killing all Kamal during the months of First Seed to the month of Sun’s Dusk.

11.	After the destruction of the Kamal, the entire Animunculi Invasion Force, consisting of 20000 Animunculi, along with 6000 troops, will be sent into Ka Po’ Tun, and after the destruction of the Tiger Dragon’s Empire, the Capital of New Aldmeris will be located in the center of the Ka Po’ Tun.

Part 2: Arrival

During the voyage, the army was pleasantly surprised to discover that none of the fabled storms that were formed by Tsaesci mages were present. The army was ready for a hurricane, and they were greeted by nothing but the cold of an average day during Frostfall. Upon arriving in Septimia, the army discovered that it was completely empty of all Tsaesci. Thinking that this was sign that the Tsaesci were fooled by the Distraction, the forced set up a base of operations and Bosmeri scouts were sent to scout the area to begin the invasion. Of the 50 scouts that were sent to the nearby Ionith, one managed to return. The scout, Irwaen of Falinesti reported seeing no Tsaesci, but instead Tiger people, who she presumed were the soldiers of the Ka Po’ Tun. The army contacted Goras of Mournhold, the general in charge of the distraction, and he reported to have not even reached the shores of the Tang Mo. The Army contacted the High Council, who realized that the Ka Po’ Tun invaded the Tsaesci and destroyed them. They recommended the best negotiators and soldiers to make contact with the Ka Po’ Tun, and ordered the soldiers not to do anything rash because the Ka Po’ Tun are a very powerful empire and the High Council did not want to start a war with them.

Part 3: Negotiations

*From the report by Arinil Larethor, High General of The Thalmor Army*

After the council commanded the slave-army to be killed, and the Captains and Generals to return to Tamriel, me, Captain J’har-da and Legionnaire Irwen, were escorted by Ka Po’ Tun warriors to the palace of the legendary Tosh Raka. An approximate account of the conversation is as follows:


*The High Council has decided to withdraw the conversation, and will instead provide a general account as written by High Councilor Orinar Larethor*

Tosh Raka welcomed the group with great pleasure and told the group that he had sent scouts over the last decades into Tamriel, and recognized the strength of the Altmer Empire. Over the course of the conversation, the group suggested different bargains to prevent a possible invasion of Tamriel by the Ka Po’ Tun. It is also important to note that the group was made aware that the Ka Po’ Tun successfully took over all of Akavir in 4E405 after discovering their ability to transform into dragons. After much negotiation that thankfully did not result in any physical violence, a truce was decided to be signed by Tosh Raka and the King of The Altmer Empire, that would make it so that all Thalmor Forces would retreat from Akavir and no further violence is to be had between the continents.

We returned to Septimia and contacted the High Council. They were extremely pleased. They, in turn contacted The King, and after 6 weeks of waiting, The King arrived and signed the treaty with the Ka Po’ Tun. Some ships could also trade and the inhabitants of the two continents could trade with each other without violence.

Note from the High Council

Although not many would say that this is true, but the High Council has unanimously agreed that the proceedings of 4E1267 were a general success, due to the new trading routes, and the prevention of further violence from the two sides. However the High Council still thinks that the Ka Po’ Tun are not to be fully trusted, and until proven otherwise, suggests that all citizens be on the lookout for any suspicious activity.
