I recently had a chance to view an elder scroll. For those unaware the elder scrolls are very important texts that tell of the future of Tamriel and the Empire of our glorious Emperor Reman II. Due to the importance of these artifacts in our history, past and future, there are many cults that surround the elder scrolls and their creation, some of the more far-fetched of these cults claim that elder scrolls are the first texts ever written, or fragments of stars from the beginning of time. However it is well known that they were written by Saint Alessia, after she first established the Cyrodilic Empire, and were inspired by the Eight Divines, as a reward for honouring them rather than the Daedra of the Wild Elves.

In reading through the elder scroll that I received I was able to learn about some of the events that our glorious Empire will see in the future. Firstly I would like to assure readers that the War with Morrowind will not occur and a peaceful settlement is made as the Dunmer chose not to reckon with our might, even giving us their strongest brass. Looking further into the future it is easy to see the flourishing of our glorious Empire, but I saw one event that caused some concern, not for our own generations but for the future. The elder scroll told of the year 3E 455 and of the greatest Daedric attack that will ever be seen, plunging the world into darkness and the Days of the Daedra.

This was as far as my elder scroll went, how our Empire fared after that is unknown to me, and I can only pray that the Eight Divines keep it safe.

Editor's Note: Once again my thanks goes out to Inius for this week's highly informative article, however we are still looking for a new official feature article writer in place of Marsus. I would like to dispel the suggestion that this will only be a temporary position. Considering the general air of uncertainty at the moment I would hope and will endeavor to ensure that all jobs at the Skingrad Informer are stable. All of our best wishes are still with Marsus though and we shall figure out how his position at the Skingrad Informer is negotiated in the happy event of his return. Who knows, we may become a newspaper blessed with two feature article writers!

In other news our Guardhouse has asked me to warn of a Breton salesman going by the name of Barthel Stegine who has been selling counterfeit goods near the Grand Chapel of Julianos, and I would like to congratulate Schlera Marillin on the birth of her second child Hieronymus.

Thank you for reading, and your next issue of the Skingrad Informer will be available on the 31^st of Second Seed.
