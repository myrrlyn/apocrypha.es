#**Island of Volkihar (Insula Volciharii) (AYEM-I &amp; II)**



Since ancient times, the island today known as the Island of Volkihar has been the key to protect the naval trade routes in the Sea of Ghosts. Today, however, it is held by the infamous Volkihar vampires and their lord, Harkon Volkihar, who, independent of the laws of the Empire, poses a significant threat to the trade vessels passing by. However, they mostly keep to themselves and leave the merchants in peace. The Volkihar vampires are supposedly named after the founder of the clan, Harkon Volkihar, and its meaning has nothing to do with vampires, but can be interpreted in a variety of different ways, the most common interpretations being “Valley-Heart” or “Warriors of the People” or even “the Plain Hairdressers”. The name clearly predates the Volkihar family’s vampiric transformation.


&amp;nbsp;


The island is completely fortified with a labyrinthine imbroglio of walls, towers and keeps, but since only very few people have landed on the island’s dark shores, only very little is known about the various locations shown on the map. Sailors consider the island cursed, avoiding it as good as they can by sailing very close to the mainland coast on this stretch. The vampires engage in neither piracy nor trade, but the crews of stranded ships vanish without trace.


&amp;nbsp;


The Volkihar vampires originated in Kilkreath around the time of Potentate Savirien-Chorak’s assassination in 2E 430. At this time, Haafingar was split in two Holds, the Hold of Haafinaam and the Hold of Kilkreath. Harkon Volkihar, the same vampire who is the leader of the Volkihar today, sought immortality and conducted a terrible, bloody ritual to Molag Bal, wherein, it is said, he sacrificed a thousand of his subjects, and in return, he and his family was turned into powerful, immortal vampires by the King of Rape. 


&amp;nbsp;


However, the people of Kilkreath hated him, and with the aid of the Jarl of Haafinaam, they overthrew him, once again uniting Haafingar into one Hold and forcing Harkon along with his family and followers to flee the land. They fled north to the isolated island on which they still dwell to this day, where Harkon had erected the tower of Isvar. He then used the chaotic times to raid the coasts of northern Skyrim and High Rock, seizing many slaves who were put to work fortifying the island, turning it into one single great, impregnable fortress of darkness and horror. 


&amp;nbsp;


As the chaos of the Interregnum subsided and Skyrim once again became more unified and able to retaliate, the Volkihar became slowly became less and less active. However, it is thought that much of the undead and vampiric activity in Skyrim is still directed by Lord Harkon in his black castle in the Sea of Ghosts.


&amp;nbsp;


***Aldinhafn* (“Old-Port”) (AYEM-I)**


The port of Aldinhafn is said to be filled with the old, rotting longboats from the time when the Volkihar actively raided and pillaged the northern coasts of Tamriel, spreading fear and dread from Daggerfall to Vvardenfell whenever his dark sails showed up on the horizon. 
   Today, the docks are reported to be mostly deserted, although several reports indicate that they are guarded by walking skeletons.


&amp;nbsp;


***Isvar* (“Ice-Watch”) (AYEM-II)**


Isvar is said to be the oldest building on Volkihar Island, predating the vampire occupation with a few years. It was constructed prior to 2E 430 to protect the naval trade routes in the Sea of Ghosts.


&amp;nbsp;


***Isvatr Bryga* (“Icewater Docks”) (AYEM-II)**


This port is reported to be much more active than the old one at Aldinhafn. However, it is also much smaller, and cannot have as many boats anchored at the same time. Why the vampires use these poorly built wooden boat bridges instead of the grand naval port at Aldinhafn is a matter of conjecture.


&amp;nbsp;


***Mant Volkihari* (“Volkihar Keep”) (AYEM-II)**


The great citadel at Mant Volkihari is supposedly the seat of Harkon Volkihar himself, but not much is known about it.


&amp;nbsp;


***Nurintór* (Modern Haafingarian *Norintor* “Northern Tower”) (AYEM-I)**


Norintor, labelled as Nurintór on most older maps along with the Mappa Solitudi, is the northernmost and the highest tower on Volkihar Island. Dark, snow-covered walls connect it with Undrinkørst to the west and Østrintór to the east. Nothing is known about its residents.


&amp;nbsp;


***Østrintór* (Modern Haafingarian *Ustintor* “Eastern Tower”) (AYEM-I)**


Ustintor, labelled as Østrintór on most older maps along with the Mappa Solitudi, is the easternmost of the great towers of Volkihar Island. It is part of the extensive fortifications running along the island’s entire coastline, obscuring the inner parts of the island from the view of outsiders. Nothing is known about the tower’s residents.


&amp;nbsp;


***Undrinkørst* (“Underground”) (AYEM-I)**


High in the rocky cliffs above Aldinhafn, a great gate is carved into the bedrock. It is said that in ancient times, flocks of captured thralls were driven from the harbor through the gates and into the dark tunnels on the other side in order to never see the sunlight again. However, no-one really knows what lies behind it, and it is unknown whether the existence of an underground dungeon actually exists here.
