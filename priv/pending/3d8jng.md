#**Norinvaar Hundred (CESS-III)**


Norinvaar Hundred, named after its capital city of Norinvaar (from Ancient Nordic Nûrthinsvârthas, “North-Watch”) [Intraglyph: Mislabelled as Nurinvar on map], makes up the northwesternmost part of Haafingar Hold. It is situated on the coast of the Sea of Ghosts, and borders the Province of High Rock to the west. To the south it borders the Lordship of Volthaal and to the east lies the March of Festrinmar. Most of the population of Norinvaar resides close to the coastal fjords, but some also live in the protected settlements along the trade routes in Norinvaar’s mountainous interior. The people of Norinvaar are a tough lot, often taking part in piracy and illegal seaborne raids on their neighbors. 


&amp;nbsp;


The city of Norinvaar was first mentioned when it was attacked and seized by Harkon Volkihar, at that time Jarl of Karthaal, around 2E 420. It was retaken by Jarl Svartr of Haafinaam a few decades later, when he united Western Skyrim under his rule. Later, the area was granted to the Wolf-Claw clan, which from here ruled over Hraggestaad, Rimhel, Eggavaar and Braatinfaal. The Wolf-Claws dominated Norinvaar until Lord Vokken Wolf-Claw was banished in 3E 137 for having sided with the Wolf-Queen in the War of the Red Diamond. 


&amp;nbsp;


Since then, a Moot has been governing the city, but despite much hard work, Norinvaar has never regained its former status as a wealthy trading port, for the city is still to this day plagued by vampires, and thus most great merchant ships avoid anchoring in Rivafjor, Norinvaar’s harbor. However, the Imperial Navy uses the harbor as a base of operations for combating piracy, and the Imperlial Legion has a garrison in the fortress of Norinvaagar (from Ancient Nordic Nûrthinsvarthalgarthas “Fortress of the Northern Guard”) in the southeastern end of the city.


&amp;nbsp;


***Braatinfaal* (From Ancient Nordic *Brâtinufâlis* “Steep-Fall”) (CESS-III)**


A coastal fishing and lumbering settlement east of Norinvaar.


&amp;nbsp;


***Felindrake* (From Ancient Nordic *Fælinedrahgkon* “Cold-Dragon”) (BEHT-II)**


This cold, windswept island located far off the Haafingarian ghost-coast has been deserted since the vampires of Volkihar settled down on the equally godforsaken island to the northwest. It is said that outcast Volkiharians rest beneath the frozen lakes of the island, only stirring from their hibernation when a trade ship wrecks on one of the razor-sharp skerries or icebergs off the island’s coast.


&amp;nbsp;


***Fyrurim Tor* (From Ancient Nordic *Fyrulrimutoris* “Pine-Frost-Tower”, in Cyrodiilic *Turris Pinipruinae*) (BEHT-V)**


An Imperial tower built to watch and guard the border with High Rock in an attempt to combat the frequent cross-border raids of the local Nords. Since its construction, raids on Luftraan have greatly diminished, although the seaborne raids on Jehenna are still as common as ever. A few steadings inhabited by hunters and people who provide services for travelers and legionaries surround the fort.


&amp;nbsp;


***Hødinfaal* (From Ancient Nordic *Hødinufâlis* “Atop-Cliff”) (CESS-III)**


An ancient cliffside stronghold, Hødinfaal predates its sister settlement Braatinfaal by several eras. However, today Braatinfaal has outgrown Hødinfaal and is now the more populous of the two.


&amp;nbsp;


***Isinnes* (“Iron-Cape” or possibly "Ice-Cape") (DOHT-III)**


A small iron mining village on the shores of the Sea of Ghosts to the east of Norinvaar.


&amp;nbsp;


***Isvatr* (From Ancient Nordic *Îsewataris* “Ice-Water”) (BEHT-III)**


Situated only a few miles west of the city of Norinvaar, Isvatr is a poor fishing village that is rumored to have close connections with the vampires of Insula Volciharii.


***Jarlaam* (From Ancient Nordic *Jerlalheimas* “Jarl-Home”) (CESS-IV)**


The settlement of Jarlaam, on the map mislabeled Jaarlaam, by far outdates the Imperial fortifications built in the early Third Era to guard the trade route. It is the traditional capital of the valley of Thutavolk.


&amp;nbsp;


***Landevik* (“Land-Cove”) (BEHT-IV)** 


A poor fishing village located between Svantniraam, Rimhel and Norinvaar.


&amp;nbsp;


***Orbataar* (From Ancient Nordic *Orfanaltâre* “Orphan’s Tear”) (DOHT-III)**


A poor fishing and horking village on the shores of the Sea of Ghosts east of Norinvaar. 


&amp;nbsp;


***Rimhel* (From Ancient Nordic *Rimuhalis* “Rime-Rock”) (BEHT-IV)**


Rimhel is ruled by the Breto-Nordic Hulbern clan that stubbornly refuses to accept the authority of the Empire and therefore continue their tradition of raiding along the Breton border. Landevik is a small fishing village where the few longboats of the clan are stored.


&amp;nbsp;


***Rivafjor* (“Wreck-Fjord”) (CESS-III)**


The fjord by which the city of Norinvaar is located.


&amp;nbsp;


***Svantniraam* (From Ancient Nordic *Swanaljotaniralheimas* “Home of the Gull-Eaters”)(BEHT-IV)**


This village and the lands around it are dominated by the infamous Svantnir clan. The rocky, frozen terrain of Svantniraam is not fit for cultivation, so instead the rough locals cultivate their fighting abilities. They are ferocious axemen and sailors, and when they don’t use their boats for fishing, they go raiding across the Breton border or along the naval trade lanes off the coast. 


&amp;nbsp;


***Svantniraul* (possibly from Ancient Nordic *Swanaljotaniralhula*) (BEHT-IV)**


The ancient homestead of the Svantnir clan, Svantniraul is walled with a palisade of tall Nordic pine trunks and mammoth tusks. Their hall is said to have been founded on the spot where their founding father, Bjøndr Uhlusun Svantnir, landed in the First Era after having drifted around on an iceberg surviving solely on seagulls following a naval battle between High King Hoag Merkiller and the Alessians.


&amp;nbsp;


***Taalandvolk* (From Ancient Nordic *Tâlanduvolkis* “Talking Valley”, sometimes translated as “Echo Dale”)**


On the border between Norinvaar and Volthaal, this valley is a superb hiding place for brigands and highway robbers looking for easy targets on the main trade route between Solitude and Jehenna. 


&amp;nbsp;


***Thutavolk* (“Howl-Vale”) (CESS-IV)**


Formerly known as *Vulfefolle* (From Ancient Nordic *Wulfelfollia* “Wolves’ Folly”), the Howling Vale got its new name when it became clear that venturing into the vale was more of a folly for men than for wolves, for after the War of the Red Diamond, the werewolf population of the valley increased manifold.
