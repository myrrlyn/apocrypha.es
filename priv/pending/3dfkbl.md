#**Sovereignty of Luftraan (Cyrodiilic Busanita Luftraani) (AYEM-V)**


According to a local legend, Luftraan (Meaning unknown; possibly, the name stems from a pre-Nordic location name) was founded in the First Era by a great warrior named Lubaarn Face-Wound. Lubaarn sailed west from Skyrim to settle down in Daggerfall, but when he saw the great Dwemer tower on the island of Luftraan, he decided to settle here instead, just on the border with the Elf-Men further inland.


&amp;nbsp;


After having ruled over Luftraan for about 10 years, Lubaarn mysteriously disappeared, leaving his holdings to his brother Torvaar, who became the first in a supposedly unbroken line of Sovereigns which still holds the power in Luftraan today. However, the dominion over which the modern sovereigns hold power is much smaller than the on ruled over by Lubaarn and his brother. Since the Jehannan Contingency in 4E 6, when the Ervette dynasty rose to power and waged a war of revenge on the Sovereign of Luftraan because of his betrayal in the War of the Bend’r-mahk, when he joined the shield-wall of the Nord invaders rather than that of the Breton defenders. 


&amp;nbsp;


Thus, the Sovereignty of Luftraan, which once consisted of much of what is now eastern Jehanna, has now shrunk to cover little more than the city itself along with the valley of Øssintaal, where the ancient tomb of Faaginaam is located. Perhaps due to the loss of significant amounts of income, the once-stable city state of Luftraan is now plagued by piracy and infighting: The Maraudeurs of Skavnirala, infamous for their connections with the Corsair Kingdom of Wayrest, are openly challenging the decrees of their lord, and at home in Luftraan, the real power rests in the hands of the Kaldrar, the Sovereign’s personal guards, who seized the power during the current Sovereign’s early years.


&amp;nsbp;


The only thing that seems stable in this turbulent time for the people of Luftraan is the Dwemer tower of Arkensal (Derived from Dwemeris Arkngzel, “Hall of the People”), which is older than the town itself and has remained sealed since Lubaarn entered it several thousand years ago.


&amp;nbsp;


***Faaginaam* (From Ancient Nordic *Feiginasheimas* “Home of the Fallen”) (AYEM-VI)**


Although supposedly built in the First Era on the orders of the second Nord Sovereign of Lufraan, Torvaar Face-Wound, some sources report that the pillars of the deeper parts of the catacombs are made of giant bones carved with swirling patterns and adorned with great elk and stag antlers, suggesting that Faaginaam is much older than what most historical sources indicate. However, heathen ancestor worship is still common in the remote Øssintaal valley, and thus admittance to the tombs of any but the most recent Sovereigns is prohibited by authority of both the living and the dead. 


   In Faaginaam, the tomb of the recently dead sovereign is often placed on top of that of the predecessor, and thus, despite being dwarfed by the surrounding mountains of the Druadach, the necropolis of Faaginaam today towers high above the longhouses of the Øssintaal valley. 


&amp;nbsp;


***Skavnirala* (From Ancient Nordic *Skavniralhlewas* “Raiders’ Lee”) (AYEM-III)**


A safe haven for pirates, smugglers and gamblers situated at the very edge of the civilized world, the harbor of Skavnirala is a good place to start an adventure or to be robbed of all your possessions and left on an ice floe to freeze to death.
