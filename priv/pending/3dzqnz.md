Entry One - 4th of Second Seed, 4E 210

“I am Drevas Andamo, renowned scholar of House Redoran. My pursuit of ancient knowledge brings me to Solstheim. In the depths of the Moesring Mountains, the eruption of Red Mountain has uncovered a vast trove of secrets pertaining to events of the Second Era.

This newly-found Nordic ruin contains the ruined journal of one ‘Milvera Telvanni,’ evidently linked to the now destroyed Great House Telvanni. From initial perusing of its contents, I have gathered that this ruin was once the refuge of a mercenary group known as the ‘Telvanni Separatists.’

It is well known that the Telvanni refused to join the Ebonheart Pact during the Interregnum of the Second Era; as such, slavery in easternmost Morrowind never ceased. Continued enslavement of the Argonians was, after all, the main reason for the extermination of the Telvanni mages in recent years.

I am hesitant to pursue this investigation further. My research is rarely focused on such minor military groups. However I must not allow my predisposition to sway my views. The exploits of House Telvanni during the Interregnum are largely unknown, and the existence of a separatist group is intriguing; if experience is any indication, these strict isolationists always have an interesting story to tell.”
