Entry Two - 5th of Second Seed, 4E 210

“As suspected, the Telvanni Separatists were indeed a contingent of Dunmer mages of the Great House which broke away when the main body refused to join the Ebonheart Pact. The journal details the activities of these Separatists after their departure from the Telvanni Isles north-east of mainland Morrowind.

It is noted that the Separatists were allied with the Scales of Sithis, an Argonian military group we assumed to have been formed during the great Argonian invasion of Morrowind 204 years ago. The Scales were, in fact, the main force responsible for the sacking of Port Telvannis and other cities in the Isles during this Accession War, supporting the An-Xileel in their vengeful campaign against the slavers of our Great Houses.

It would appear that the Separatists worked alongside the Scales of Sithis to liberate Argonian slaves from Telvanni control across eastern Morrowind. The journal makes it very clear that Telvanni slavers were killed in order to rescue the slaves: I can only imagine that this was enough to provoke the Telvanni into hunting the Separatists down, even if they were not so inclined on keeping their arcane secrets from others.

After many months of liberating the slaves, the Separatists settled here in Solstheim in what is likely this same Nordic ruin.

Before 4E 16, Solstheim belonged to the Nords and would undoubtedly have been controlled by the Ebonheart Pact during the Interregnum of the Second Era. Perhaps the Separatists settled here to avoid House Telvanni; to bring Telvanni soldiers to Pact territory without warning could start a war.

Recruiting Nord mercenaries from across Solstheim, the Separatists began to take down Dark Anchors across Skyrim – curious.

By Frostfall, the Separatists’ efforts had been noticed by the Ebonheart Pact. Milvera claims to have gained a personal audience with King Jorrun, the leader of the Pact.

To prevent provoking House Telvanni, an official alliance between the Separatists and the Pact was not made. However, it does appear that the Skald-King hired the Separatists to take down specific Dark Anchors in Pact territory on multiple occasions.

I would never consider that a group of Telvanni mages would rescue slaves purely due to ethical beliefs, nor would I assume that such a belief could justify the killing of Telvanni slavers: the liberation of Argonians across Morrowind suggests a much deeper motivation for the Separatists’ hunting of Molag Bal’s forces.

What could move such strict isolationists to unite and ally themselves with former enemies? I sense that something dark befell those mages in the Isles long ago; whatever that might be, this ruin - this journal – can reveal the truth."
