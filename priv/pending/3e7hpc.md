*Gwaering ran through the forest. She could feel the stench of blood in the wind. But there was something else. Something…different. As she ran, she heard the distant screams of elves, her people. She wanted to help them, but knew that she could not do anything. Suddenly, the ground shook and Gwaering fell into the mud. She burrowed deep within and held her breath. As she lay there, feeling a stampede over her, she realized that she felt very weak. She suspected what it was, but didn’t dare to imagine it. The ground stopped shaking, and Gwaering rose from the mud. She wiped the mud off her face and broke into a jog.*



**6 days earlier**

**Silvenar, Valenwood**

Indaenir walked into his home, and saw his wife and the Green Council sitting at his dining table. As he opened the door, all of the eyes in the room darted towards him. The Grand Councilor requested that he sit down, and Indaenir did.

“What news do you bring, Grand Councilor?”

“M’lord, our fears have proven to become a reality. Septim has done it.”

“You don’t mean…”

“Yes, and we all know what we must do to survive.”

The Silvenar put his palms over his face and groaned.

“You know that I do not agree to this?” – He said, his tone very serious, but to the trained ear, scared.

“Yes, m’lord, but The Council sees no other option.”

The Silvenar stood up. Everyone in the room was looking at him.

“Have you talked to the Khajiit?”

“M’lord?”

“I seem to recall you saying that there were rumors that they are planning to leave Nirn”

“You cannot expect us to send a part of our troops to Elsweyr just on the basis of rumors, it ...”

“I can do it.” – Gwaering chimed in

The whole room was in silence as everyone turned to look at the corner of the room, where Gwaering was now stood up.

“I can do it quicker than any other Bosmer, and you know it, Indaenir.”

The Silvenar thought for a moment.

“I must meditate on this.” – He whispered

“With all due respect, m’lord, we do not have the time.”

“Gwaering, are you sure you want to do this?” – Indaenir looked at Gwaering, his face showing concern, yet he was still determined.

“I have never been so sure, love. I want to do anything to protect my people.”

Indaenir went up to her and whispered something in her ear.

“Very well then, you will depart in one hour.” – He announced.
