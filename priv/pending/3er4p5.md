Crystal-like-law stood tall one day,

And walked among us - into our fray.

All were caught by the yoke of a trance,

The stone spoke softly and began a dance.

"Beware the rain, the skies, the seas,

Look not into the mirrored eyes of bees.

Muddy the mirrored tower's base,

For if you look in you'll see more than your face.

Greater the power of the simulacrum therein,

Than the race of Mer that make up its skin.

For if you look through to Auri-el's fault,

The land around will shake with a jolt.

Imposed upon you the Numidium's foot,

And all thatâ€™s left a pile of soot."

*This poem was one seen to have been circulated for some time in the Summerset Isles during the early third era. Whether the event depicted actually took place is up for debate, however the general view is that this is certainly a very fanciful depiction of anything that did. Regardless the poem's important message would seem to be a warning that all we see in our world is inextricably tied to that which exists in others.*
