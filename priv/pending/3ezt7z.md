*Gwaering came across a clearing in the forest. At first, she didn’t recognize the village in from of her. It was torn up, the roots thrown around everywhere, and no people in sight. She tried to concentrate, but she had a massive headache. She walked towards a tree and lay under its shade. As she lay there, she head the distant sound of screams. She tried to get up, but couldn’t. Her head was throbbing with pain, and she could hardly breathe. As she crawled towards a house, she looked over to the left, and saw a body. It looked vaguely familiar, however she could not discern the details. She thought for a moment, looking towards the forest, then towards the body. After a moment, she started crawling again.*

**Palace of the Mane, Torval, Elsweyr**

The bodies of Khajiiti elite guard lay on the floor, their blood giving it a much needed recoloring. Gwaering stood in front of the door to the Mane’s quarters, attempting to break it down.

“Mane, you have to listen! The Bosmer have always been kind to your people while the rest of the world treated you like animals!” – Gwaering shouted

“The world does not matter anymore!”

“Mane, do not make me break down this door! MANE!"

As Gwaering pushed, she heard a near-silent whispering from the room.

“MANE, open this door RIGHT NOW!”

With one final push, the door cracked open and Gwaering ran inside. As soon as she did, she was knocked back into the doorway. Inside, the Mane was standing in the center of the room, and Gwaering realized that the whispering had turned into a loud bass. The Mane was speaking in Ta’agra.

“AHZIRR HE NIRNI NABA JAJO” 

The words echoed through Gwaering’s head over and over as she fell into a trance. She felt herself getting weaker and soon realized that she could not move. With her head ringing and unable to move, she fainted.
