The fourth volume continues telling of Pelinal’s war exploits, and also hints to his later demise.
***
&gt;Pelinal drove the sorcerer armies past the Niben, claiming all the eastern lands for the rebellion of the Paravania, and Kyne had to send her rain to wash the blood from the villages and forts that no longer flew Ayleid banners, for the armies of Men needed to make camps of them as they went forward.

As is probably clear by now, the use of magic is linked to kingship in Ayleid culture. All their kings are described as powerful mages. This is probably also to create a sense of difference with the Nedes, who valued magic less, and even into later Imperial culture, magic was often not associated with the kingship.  
The Rebellion is gaining traction, and many Ayleid city-states are being crushed by the advancing armies. Even Kyne aids the Rebellion, by conveniently cleaning the ruins in order for the Nedes to make camp.

&gt;...and he broke the doors open for the prisoners of the Vahtache with the Slave-Queen flying on Morihaus above them, and Men called her Al-Esh for the first time.

Many of the Nedes were not yet liberated at this time, and it is likely the Rebellion only grew after each captured city.  
This is also the first time the name Al-Esh appears, from which Alessia is probably derived. The name Alessia appears in the first Volume, as “Perrif, anon Alessia”. It is very likely that this is a title indicating something divine or glorious, but I couldn’t find the exact meaning of the elements. “El” appears relatively often in Ayleidoon, indicating something holy or great, but it does not need to be related to “Al-“. Whatever Esh means is anyone’s guess.  
It is clear that Morihaus and Perrif liked each other a lot, and were even lovers. Morihaus also functioned as Alessia’s steed multiple times (in more than one way).

&gt;He entered the Gate at ... to win back the hands of the Thousand-Strong of Sedor (a tribe now unknown but famous in those days), which the Ayleids had stolen in the night, two thousand hands that he brought back in a wagon made of demon-bone, whose wheels trailed the sound of women when ill at heart... Text lost...

Apparently this is more of a symbolic victory. From what I gather, the Ayleids imprisoned a large part of the Nedic armies, and cut of their hands. Pelinal returned them as a form of symbolic victory. The return of the hands is pretty grim. Pelinal returned with a terrifying wagon (possibly Daedra made, judging by “demon-bone”), with a following of weeping wifes and mothers.  
This shows the relation Pelinal had with the Nedes. He was their champion, and almost single handedly  brought them victory, but they were also scared of him, mostly due to his unpredictable and extremely violent character.

&gt;And after the first Pogrom, which consolidated the northern holdings for the men-of-'kreath, he stood with white hair gone brown with elfblood at the Bridge of Heldon, where Perrif's falconers had sent for the Nords, and they, looking at him, said that Shor had returned, but he spat at their feet for profaning that name.

The men-of-‘kreath are listed in the “Adabal-a” as one of the human tribes living in Ayleid-held territories.  
From the Adabal-a:  
&gt;Ayleids herded in men from across all the Niben: kothri, nede, al-gemha, **men-of-'kreath (though these were later known to be imported from the North)**, keptu, men-of-ge (who were eventually destroyed when the Flower King Nilichi made great sacrifice to an insect god named [lost]), al-hared, men-of-ket, others;  

(bold for emphasis)

‘kreath is probably Falkreath, which was historically part of Colovia. The Adabal-a says they were “imported from the North”, so it is possible these men weren’t Nede but Nord/Atmoran.  
The location of Heldon is lost, but it is likely to be somewhere in northern Cyrodiil or southern Skyrim. Alessia called for support from the Nords, which she receives. Historically, all the Cyrodiilic Empires lasted as long as their Nordic support.  
Pelinal is also named a Shezzarine here. As usual, the text doesn’t state hard facts on the subject, and leaves the truth somewhere in the middle. In this case, the Nords are convinced they are looking at Shor, while Pelinal seems to disagree. It is interesting that he feels unfit for the title. He gets insulted when called that, not because he doesn’t want anything to do with Shor/Shezzar/Lorkhan, but because he feels unworthy of being called it, insinuating that naming him thus is an insult to Shor.

&gt;He led them anyway into the heart of the hinterland west, to drive the Ayleids inward, towards the Tower of White-Gold, a slow retreating circle that could not understand the power of Man’s sudden liberty, and what fury-idea that brought.

Pelinal still follows through with what he (probably) promised to Alessia. The Rebellion is coming to an end, and the Ayleids are screwed. They are having difficulty understanding the sudden outburst and the tactics of the Nedes. It is also interesting to note that the freedom of the Nedes was prophesised as the first Vision to Alessia, and it is possible this form of freedom was a new concept, unknown to the Ayleids.

&gt;His mace crushed the Thundernachs that Umaril sent as harriers on the rebellion's long march back south and east, and carried Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne to Zuathas the Clever-Cutting Man (a nede with a keptu name) for healing when the bull had fallen to a volley of bird beaks.

I haven’t found mentioning of Thundernachs outside of the Song, but the final part of the name seems consistent with Atronach, so possibly Storm Atronachs (or at least a Daedric life form). Umaril was in a pact with a Daedric Prince, so it is not unlikely.  
Again, Pelinal shows compassion by saving Morihaus, and the love he felt for him has its own volume. He carries him to a doctor. The Keptu were another tribe living in Cyrodiil alongside the Nedes, and it is likely there already was a cultural symbiosis between the races of man living in Cyrodiil. The Nedes were probably the most present or developed group, and their culture was the one that survived the longest (compare the Imperialisation of the provinces towards the end of the Third Era).  
Again, bird symbolism with the Ayleids. I think at this point it is relatively clear.

&gt;And, of course, at the Council of Skiffs, where all of the Paravania's armies and all of the Nords shook with fear at the storming of White-Gold, so much so that the Al-Esh herself counseled delay,

The White-Gold Tower was an important religious centre for the Ayleids, conveniently placed in the middle of Cyrodiil (and, with that, the centre of Tamriel, Nirn, Mundus, and basically the entire Aurbis). Being on an island in the middle of a lake, it is very well defendable, and now filled with Ayleid troops. Storming the centre of the universe isn’t a simple task, and even Alessia seems hesitant to attack. Judging by the name “Council of Skiffs”, the Nedes were planning on attacking the city by boat.

&gt;Pelinal grew furious, and made names of Umaril, and made names of what cowards he thought he saw around him, and then made for the Tower by himself, for Pelinal often acted without thought.

Starting at from the first volume, it is clear that Pelinal does whatever he wants to do, even against the counsel of those around him. He was also known to immediately start calling others names when he got angry. Again, he is a one-man wrecking ball, and later volumes mention how he stormed the Tower. This line also hints at his untimely demise in the Tower, a common narrative technique in epics.

This ends the fourth volume: On His Deeds.
