The final volume of the Song is by far the shortest, and deals with Pelinal speaking at the deathbed of Alessia. It does hold some interesting things, though.

***
Just like the seventh volume, the eighth has its own introduction.

&gt;[Editor's Note: This is the oldest and most fragmentary of all the extant Pelinal texts. It is, however, likely closest to the original spoken or sung form of the Song, and therefore has great value despite its brevity. Strangely, it appears that Pelinal is present at Alessia's deathbed, although he was killed by Umaril earlier in the saga (years before Alessia's death). Some scholars believe that this fragment is not actually a part of the Song of Pelinal, but most accept its authenticity although there is still much debate as to its significance.]

Since the seventh volume was already dated to mid sixth century 1E, which is about 300 years after the events, this is a REALLY old version of the Song, and might even be recorded within one lifetime of the events. It is interesting that, if the text is truly authentic, the tone of the epic used to be very different. Pelinal does not seem to be the one-minded wrecking ball, but more of a divine advisor to Alessia. It should be noted that all events between his dismemberment and Alessia’s death aren’t described, and there should be more than enough time there for him to have a change of heart.  
While the editor seemed to be surprised at Pelinal’s presence, it should be noted that he appeared to be able to converse with Morihaus after his dismemberment in the seventh volume, as well as in the Adabal-a. He also later appeared in ghost form to the Champion of Cyrodiil in the Knights of the Nine expansion, so it is possible that, if he did die, he appears in that form here.  
Like I already stated, the tone of this fragment is completely different from the first seven volumes, which is probably the cause of the debate regarding its authenticity, as well as the fact that the text is so fragmented that it is hard to place it within the rest of the tale.  
While there is no indication of who is exactly talking in this fragment, the introduction leads me to believe that Pelinal is the one speaking.

&gt;... and left you to gather sinew with my other half, who will bring light thereby to that mortal idea that brings [the Gods] great joy, that is, freedom, which even the Heavens do not truly know,

The mention of other half is interesting. Vivec often mentions his two halves in the Lessons, often attributing his actions and deeds to his mortal or divine self. In this case, it is more likely Pelinal talks about one of his divine counterparts, so either Lorkhan or Akatosh. In this case, I would put my money on Lorkhan, based on the fact that sinews are mentioned, as well as freedom, and him being the god of mortals and flesh.  
Lorkhan is also related to the idea of Freedom as illustrated in the second volume, where the concept is named Shezzar Who Goes Missing. As Vehk points out in “Vehk’s Teachings”:

&gt;And this is the most-reached destination of all that embark upon this road. Why would Lorkhan and his (unwitting?) agents sabotage their experiments with the Tower? Why would he crumble that which he esteems?  
Perhaps he failed so you might know how not to.

Just like in the Second Volume, it is mentioned that this drive for freedom, and the ambition required for it, is something the gods love in mortals, and maybe even admire. The Gods seem to have a problem with understanding Freedom, further enforcing the idea that enlightenment is only truly achievable for mortals (even though those ideas are often given by gods).

&gt;[which is] why our Father, the... [Text lost]... in those first [days/spirits/swirls] before Convention... that which we echoed in our earthly madness. [Let us] now take you Up.

The text is very fragmented here, and it is hard to pinpoint what is actually said. It seems to deal with Tamriel as the Arena. Akatosh is involved, and the text mentions the conflicts during the Dawn. I believe the text is implying that all conflicts on Tamriel can be explained as myth-echoes of divine conflicts, often dealing with Anuic and Padomaic principles. This is also the moment that the gods take up Alessia as one of them.

&gt;We will [show] our true faces... [which eat] one another in amnesia each Age.

Of course, all imagery regarding the gods is simply mortal fashion. Being infinite beings, it is likely that their true form is incomprehensible for mortals.  
This last line also mentions the kalpic cycle (if we can interpret Age as meaning kalpa). The gods are eaten by Alduin (or eat each other, as the text implies). They destroy each other, and forget everything that happened, resetting the world to Convention, and have the whole charade happen over and over again.

This ends the eigth volume: On His Revelation at the Death of the Al-Esh, and the Song of Pelinal.
