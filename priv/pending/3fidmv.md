**Admonition on sanctioned murder and Merethic hubris**

*Lord Councilor Raxellius IV Perrifinalba, Mothprince Seyd, Magocrator of   C I S V A L U S I A*





All may be aware of the piety and orthodoxy of  those Cisvalusians who stand by St. Hegestion, whose silk is interminably woven from the days he stood with the reed phalanxes of Alessia herself,  as clear mythography follows; even after freedom the star-angels of Merid spoke to him in migraines, pushing him to the mountains, first to  Paravantium-Tor, then to the Lonesome Vale and finally High Seyd;  where he wrestled and slayed the gryphon Morilatta under the twin crescents of Shezzar, the blood of the monster under the moonlight was transmuted in the silver veins, whose trickle granted the prosperity of his descendants through the ages within the Citadel of Seyd cut below by terraces carved like emeralds in the mist, granting  not only subsistence but abundance for peace and isolation.

 Our silk, in its totality or decked in panoplies is therefore of silver pearlescence, immaculate as the wings of Kynareth, a monophonic theme of elegance favorable to pragmatism and clearance of mind.
Some call us intolerant, which is unfair, some will refuse to understand, and others are just passive to the gathering clouds of Mereth upon our very borders and provincial territories.

Seyd still the most formidable fortress East of the Niben, its silver walls resisted the invasions of Akavir, it resisted incessant barrages of ophiology from Potentates, plagues and interregnal tyrants, only to be infiltrated under the open border conditions supported by Imperial decree.

Despite the best efforts of Census &amp; excise offices to document every dunmer, the recent tragedy was that of a murdered imperial official investigating the slave trade, a crime admitted as sanctioned murder by exiles of Morovinda Galo, who remain free and visible in the Imperial court, under the robes of the Duke of Vardentombo,  the popular response was accordingly, with the resulting flaying of 17 innocent aliens and several others being thrown from the walls of Seyd citadel, of which my hands remain washed.
With this incident the “line in the ash” was drawn by the Princes and Doges of Nibenay, despite “Queen in Morovinda ” Ly. Barentia Symmachus being properly warned of the fact that disaster will befall to her tribe if any official beyond the rank of Legate is victimized by sanctioned murder.  

Since the days of the old empire and Chancellor Guis it was warned that the ideology of sanctioned murder leaking from Province Morovinda far from avoiding full scale conflicts would inflame them to the point of revolution and secession, it would decapitate entire realms from their rulers for the benefit of invaders, and that emperors would be their fixed target.

While the officials of the emperor are being murdered, the Nibennium is in slumber with bribed censors allowing the free circulation of  “The Love of Nerevaldo and Almalest” which is an abominable set of panel-stories in daedric typography, being sold in broad Magnus at Remanel Square, themed by the tales of the people who cannot face extinction and defeat with the exact pride veil covering their jealousy, they prefer anything but dignity, clinging to parasitism and stagnation in the cultivation of treachery and murder and revolting proselytism when none care about Neravaldos &amp; lessons! Their heroes are even being sung in the stages of the Serious Opera! The great Nibenean art! All which is the hopeless topic of decadent Azurian Congregations of Strident harbors, sugar dandies and worse rascals, I’ve seen enough this kind of frivolous devotion and mad fashion in the present youth.

That the House of Talos, granted the Rhombus of God that the Paravant herself wielded against the barbary of Mereth, allows slavery under its provinces is a matter of shame and indignity and equal in face of the sanctioned murder ideology patronized by the fairy gods in Morovinda Templi, who lies uncharted by our own indulgence.



The increasing cost of protecting the borders beyond that of base legionary occupation lies on the number of 28 Remandors in Ebony bouillon yearly -- a squander of divine resources-- for frequent incursions of ash savages on trade routes, and the helplessness of cat and lizard civilians from untreatable Drex slave drivers, whose abductions by air are nightmares for those who will know no peace as long such horror occurs under our very eyes, as no proper colonization was ever pursued on the Fertile Descan, therefore no correction inflicted.

With the Empire muted, the path of personal intervention is tempting, when after all that passed it should lay flat and salted beyond help, with their rulers tried by court-martial, after a punitive expedition, and only then honored as the resting place of Shezzar’s Heart,  as such warning is issued not only by me, but by many investors in the Zenithar Bourse &amp; Transmutation Exchange (an institution plagued by accountancy sabotages of Selvane speculators), the creation of the New East Empire Company is long overdue, as Imperial Padomaic lanes are in neglect, favoring the near monopoly of the Solitudean Sea of Ghosts Lane. 
There are council votes for such, but there is still time for our Colovian partners to consider involvement, it is unlikely that they will not want to pile the heads of Indorilos and Hedorantes in the altars of Sancre-Tor like the hosts of the Second Cyrodiil and that the blade of Reman-El must slice through the audacious red-eyed ash and diabolical mist to reach the third of their unattested fairy Gods, Messer Volveck, the hubristic levitating seer responsible for the sanction of legal murder, of no less than two Cyrodilic rulers, and for the foreign chapters, the cult of sociopathy emanating from the ideologies of sanctioned murder that hides in Cyrod, which in every realm should be take to justice, judgment and appropriate vindication.

While Seyd has self-defense standing armies of no more than tens of thousands, it is able to raise several thousands more by combining the forces of the Merchant Republic of Cheydinhal, countless more offered by lease of the Forebear Party of Taneth, as sand levies, as many Nords as money can buy and more importantly, Cisvalusia by itself can offer enough of the manufacturing infrastructure and agricultural surplus to maintain supply lines as far as Necron. The independent effort of the armies of Cisvalusia, Poppadom, Cannulia, Tarnapolitana, Pantenegro, Remania and Transnibennaica may very well be staging a triumph on Talos Bridge in response against vassal aggression and anarchy. It is beyond immoral to allow the Dark elf people to benefit from a free Empire, without first being adequate to its rules, by whatever force necessary.

May the Empire be aware, may the ash people respect the line in the ash, for they remain by the Grace of Aleshut Paravant Magna! By Shezzar and his blood! By Akatosh perennial!
