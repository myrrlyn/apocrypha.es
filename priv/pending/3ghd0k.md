Witness account of Cyrodiilic scholar :

The ice thawed and he was free again. Through the thick cloud of frost, he was just a vague shape, a dash of colour on a canvas, nothing more. Several heavy thuds were heard and he was before me. Bigger than any Troll I've seen, and twice as menacing. Its skin like dirty ice, and its eyes like shimmering blue crystals. Its perfect stature was almost unbelievable, the way its big muscles and abs looked as if they were masterfully chiseled. It let out a hoarse snarl and that one noise parted the skies and shook the ground. It dashed forward, despite its heavy weight leaving no trace on the snow, and crashed into the hut, sending debris flying everywhere as he savaged the belongings of the occupants and tore everything apart.

The words of a Nord :

Ye Gods! What them scholars write about them Kemal-- or Kenal, is it? Anyway, what they say about them's a fib, nay Siree, it is not true, it is foolery! Afore the ages when Altmer did as they pleased, me pa and his pa before him were told by my great grand pa who had relatives that fought in the war that them Snow Demons were not an easy catch. Nay, even them scholars say it took three armies to take them down, but hearken now! My pa says, and he did look me right in the eye and promise me this was true for what he knew, aye, that these Demons were only a hundred in number, and eight foot tall, weathered from what he said could only be guessed to be wars and age, and they fought with every bit of venom and vile in  their bodies to bring down whoever they could, and it took thousands of mer, beast and men to take them all down!

Biological analytical work by Altmer medic :

Anatomy - Kamal do not actually rely on oxygen as many of the races of Nirn do, in fact, they (like daedra) rely on the natural magic they harbor inside themselves to keep them alive instead of oxygen and blood, therefore they do not have a need of lungs or heart, but what is strange is that we have found that Kamal actually do not have **any** of the internal organs that most men, mer and beasts on Nirn contain. They are their own species, with every organ of their own, which works entirely differently to any organ we've ever worked on. The Kamal contain a very complex digestive system, nerve system and skeletal system. That is all of the bodily functions we've actually found to be existent in Kamal.

Mating - We have found that Kamal actually find mates like most species do : by impressing them. The way Kamal impress mates is by participating in fights with fellow males. These fights go on until one of the males refuses to fight anymore or cannot get up after being knocked down. The fights are usually between two friends and those friends, even after the fight, do not harbor hate between each other, instead they have respect for the winner. Once the Kamal reel in a mate, they have to take the mate for life, but there is no ceremony whatsoever, as marriage is an oath only, which binds the two Kamal for life. Kamal procreate the way all races do, but we cannot determine where their testes or ovaries are, all we know is that they do have genitals as all other races.

Diets and Hunting - Kamal are omnivores, though they usually use herbs to lure in prey, and use spears and bows to kill their prey, as they think swords, maces and axes are impractical for hunting and put you at a disadvantage for some reason.

Social ranks - A respected citizen is given priority over most major events over commoners, and a citizen can be stepped up to this rank if they are known for doing good things that improve the community or are wealthy. A ranger is known to be so if they hunt and feed more than only their own family and act as a guard of their community, they are given special food and accommodation for their trouble. A hero is known to be so if they : 

A) Protect the leader during a moment of great danger for the leader.

B) Embark on a dangerous and important quest given to them by the leader.

A hero will be given a big home of their own, along with a great sum of money, and will be branded a Hero publicly, with the ability to opt out a couple of times if they get in trouble with the law.

To acquire a greater rank you will have to be part of the Leader's close family or part of the royal family.
