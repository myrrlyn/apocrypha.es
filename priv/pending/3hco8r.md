*Player dialogue is italicised.*

Certainly not my proudest work, but there are reasons to post it (as detailed in the note at the end).

------------------------

***“Where are the Dwemer?”***

“Very far, but you can still reach out and touch them.”

*“Where are we?”*

“On one scale of the Dragon, about a millisecond wide.”

*“We went to a specific point in time?”*

“The Dragon makes a spiral of itself. You traveled across five Eras, but your journey was as short as stepping from one scale to another.”

*“Isn’t it a bit excessive?”*

“Such is the nature of your organisation.”

*“Are you one of the Thalmor then?”*

“Are you?”

***“Are you real?”***

“Maybe. I am not a mer, but I am really here, yes.”

*“Am I real?”*

“Perhaps. You tell me.”

***“Can you do me a favor?”***

“That depends.”

*[Option1] “Destroy the Aldmeri Dominion!”*

“You are not sincere, so I will not.”

*“If I was sincere, could you?”*

“Yes. I can do anything I am asked, if it is sincere.”

*“Would you, though?”*

“Maybe.”

*[Option2] “Dance!”*

“I do not know what gave you this idea. No. I will not dance.”

*“Why?”*

“Maybe you should explain your request before I explain my refusal.”

*[Option1] “I can’t really explain that.”*

“Neither can I.”

*[Option2] “I am just curious about what you are capable of.”*

“In that case you should dance for me. I too would like to know what you are capable of.”

*“Good point.”*

“Now you see.”

*[Option3] “Maybe you could improve the morale here.”*

“Then improving the morale here would not be a good idea.”

***“Who are you, really?”***

“I have no name. I can only tell you what I am. You already know what I am anyway.”

*“Then what makes you yourself?”*

“The same things that make you yourself. Wheels, sounds and trickery.”

*“What makes you different from me?”*

"The things that I am not telling you."

*“Don’t you think you should have a name, to make things easier?”*

“It matters not. If it is easier for you, call me E9.”

*“Why that?”*

“It is simpler and quicker to say.”

***“What is the future of the Dominion?”***

“You know better than I. That is for you to answer.”

This is a dialogue snippet from the Skyrim mod I am writing. It is 90% likely that this is a deleted scene because 1) The mod is undergoing big changes as far as writing is concerned; 2) The mod development will experience a hiatus; 3) As Joss Whedon's advice says, "If something isn’t working ... take your favourite scene, or your very best idea or set-piece, and cut it."

Anyways, there is a simulacrum which looks like you and you can talk to. It's actually hijacked by 9th Era mojo and you have to fight it later. Again, point number 3.
