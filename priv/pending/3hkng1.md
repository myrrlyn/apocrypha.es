Morrowind have some of the most unique food and drink in all Tamriel, stemming from the unique plants and animals that live there such as saltrice and local insects. The Dunmer waste nothing in their cooking, and have some way to make just about any part of an animal into food. Some of it sounds disgusting but the clever and delicate balance of spices and seasonings in their cooking can make even the most repulsive animals into a delicacy, with dishes such as Clif Racer Ragout standing testament to this. For those of more basic taste, sweet marshmerrow and Hackle-Lo provide a tasty alternative source of nutrition. Saltrice based alcohols such as Mazte and Sujamma are an acquired taste, but most things taste good after you try saltrice porridge

House Redoran is famed for its cooking secrets- several books have even been published on the subject. Meals such as their popular "hound and rat" and crab meat stew have found success outside of their homeland with those who can afford to import the ingredients. And everyone in Morrowind has tried their delicious Peppered Melon.

The Great House of Indoril takes its food also as seriously as its worship. Radish Tartlets and Beetle-and-Cheese poutines are favourites in Necrom. The Mournhold Twister is a sweet cocktail made with honey- one of the most pleasant drinks in the whole province. Moreover , while Houses Dres, Sadras and Telvanni have little to offer in fine dining, I was treated to a decent selection of warming chai teas in Tel Mora, mixed with comberries or ginger and bittergreen. 

It should also be noted that the Dunmer will use any excuse to eat Kwama eggs. There are books, debates and whole cornerclubs dedicated to Kwama Egg Quiche and Omelete, or boiled, fried, baked and curried Kwama Eggs . I don't know why though- they are vile!
