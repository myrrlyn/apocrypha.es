Religion in this province has been through some dramatic changes in recent history. The fall of the Tribunal and the rise of the New Temple has meant that many old practices have changed or disappeared completely, with new ones taking their place. The Great Houses have all dealt with these changes with varying degrees of success.

 
Redoran welcomed the reclamations with open arms. Many temples previously dedicated to ALMSIVI were swiftly transformed to worship the gods of the New Temple. Whether this was because the House truly changed their allegiance to the new gods so quickly, or that it was an attempt to buy the support of the Temple is up for debates, though most do worship the Reclamations at this point. 

House Indoril suffered greatly during the transition. ALMSIVI were reduced to the status of Saints in place of the Mephala, Azura and Boethiah and the most devout Great House almost fell into utter chaos. Many of those in House Indoril venerate the three new Saints almost as much as the Reclamations themselves, while the New Temple absorbed Indoril. The clash of old worshippers stuck to their past ways and those devoted to the Reclamations has created a palpable sense of unease among this Great House's membership.


Houses Dres and Sadras have made relatively peaceful transitions into the new ways, although not as quickly or easily as Redoran. Older practices still stick with some members though, with many Dres households still using outdated customs. These are becoming more and more rare with time, however.

 
As always, House Telvanni has remained largely impartial to the changes. Sadrith Mora lacked proper a temple two-hundred years ago, and it lacks one now.


Sadly, most Imperial forts have been abandoned since the Red Year, and most of their Imperial Cult shrines have been long forgotten alongside them. Other than a small chapel in Blacklight (which even then only a small house  with a makeshift altar) I struggled to find many places to pay my respects to the Nine.
