They tell me he stormed the battlements and rendered them sanguinary, they told me he became a great leader and even a religious figure. And for him, I'm overjoyed. They tell me he sounded his horn and shouted the worst of scum out of this world. And for him I'm glad. 

And they called me a felled king, that worst of scum. Of that I'm saddened. And they called me a backstabber, and the worst of things. Of that I'm angered. 

All of that I did not do, all of that I did the opposite of, I was accused of, and now I slumber in the bowels of hell. 

And all of that I did do, all of that that made a safer place of Tamriel, it is forgotten, and now I slumber in the bowels of hell. 

I pray the skies provide him the best of asylum. I pray he's satisfied with what he is rewarded with, and may that be only the best.

I only pray the depths show me mercy. I only pray I am well in my afterlife. 

For all I did not want I got, and now how can I rest in peace?

For all I loved now thinks I hated them, and now how can I rest in peace?

I had once a soul, and now it no more resides within me. And now I return to my slumber, and now I return to that endless melancholy.
