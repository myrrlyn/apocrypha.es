Mcalzad Zel is a legendary ruin, lost to time, located somewhere between the Druadach and Dragontail Mountains, in a valley as the ‘Dragon’s Tooth.’  The valley is colossal, forty miles wide, and two-hundred miles long.  To the north and east lie the Druadach, to the west lie the Dragontail, and to the south lie the ridges and canyons of Alik’r.

The Valley itself is well known, but it’s been scoured up and down, yet the land is still devoid of any ruins.  The city of Elinhir lies in the eastern end of the valley, but even this picturesque town has its problems.

Elinhir lies under the shadow of Mount Crorn, a mountain that makes up the thinnest part of the Skyrim-Hammerfell border.  Mount Crorn is thought to be home to Anlemnthand, a Dwemer Ruin supposedly connected to Mcalzad Zel.

Another name for Mcalzad Zel is ‘Fang Lair,’ as it was supposedly where Alduin destroyed the Dwemeri people of the Dragon's Teeth.

So, I decided to travel to Elinhir, and took a four day trek into the mountains, through the valley, and into the Flacecian Vale, where the great Sulphur Pits boil and spit, and high above the steam clouds lay Mcalzad Zel, impossible to reach amongst the red peaks.

So, I’ve travelled to Rihad, to gather what I can, as well as an expedition crew to help ascend the mountain, so as to finally make it to the ruin of legend.
