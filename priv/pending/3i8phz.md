[ooc - I have characters who might be interested in this dialogue.  Can we establish when this journal article is/was published]

&gt;Another example is how dreams have no clear composition outside the story they are trying to tell. The desk in my dreams is not made of wood. It merely appears wooden for whatever purpose my mind has established. In contrast, the desk I wrote this paper on can be broken down and examined. The immensely small daedrons and aedrons can be witnessed interacting with a Micro-Perception spell. If this were a dream, surely the desk would exist merely as a conceptual construct. Why on Nirn would it break down into measurable and examinable pieces?

Khajiit  reads this interesting article in the 'Philosophia Metaphysica' journal and feels he must comment.

The great difficulty facing Droven is the difficulty of mortal epistemology.  The hypnogogic nature of the Dream requires that the unconscious manifestations of Deitic archetypes ("Creation") are necessarily bound to the Godhead's unconscious; transcendence of the Dream is impossible without the miracle of metaphysics known as CHIM (from the origial Ehlnofic, "royalty").  Only through the objectivity granted by ontological transcendence (in essence, the re-writing of the being's protonymic) can one WITHIN the Dream see themselves as part of, and outside of, the Dream.  This one knows that Droven knows only a few such individuals exist in the history of Nirn.

This one suspects you see the problem:  unable, but for a few, to go beyond the unconscious boundaries of the Godhead, its individual hypnogogic emanations (Khajiit, Altmer, the fly buzzing by this one's head) cannot obtain objective insight.  Any magic used in the Dream will be a projection of the Dream, any logic will be the logic of the Dream.  The use of the Micro-Perception spell does not reveal the objective reality of the Dream itself (being a part of the Dream) but only what the Dream itself allows.  Something within a system can only reflect the system.

Perhaps this one has spoken too deeply?  Droven objects that the desk in his dream is not made of wood.  S'thajj points out that there is no such thing as 'wood'.  Wood is a concept from within the Dream.  Whatever word you use to describe what it is made of (aedrons, daedrons, cranial emissions) does not change that it is what it is:  a thought in the mind of God.

Only if one were able to transcend the mind of God could one truly see the Dream for what it is.
