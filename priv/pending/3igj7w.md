A student of Skyrim's bardic arts must be familiar with the musical traditions of Skyrim. Skyrim's history has been sculpted and told by great bards throughout the ages, and songs are the most important part of this process. 

The art of the bard has its roots in the earliest days of man. Much of the early history is lost to time, as it was passed down orally rather than written. These songs died alongside their performers. What little music was written down has mostly been ruined over the ages. Despite this, the known history stretches back thousands of years into the past.

Ancient Nordic skalds are some of the earliest known musicians on Tamriel. With them were born the ancient traditions still taught today. These skalds wove epic tales into songs alongside lute, flute and drum; giving birth to the stories of Olaf One-Eye and his great foe Numinex or of the legendary Dragonborn. These early bards shaped the events and made history with their verses. This is the power of words, and those who know this power can themselves decide how history is percieved.

Later, as the art of the bard became refined, institutions such as the Bard's College in Solitude developed to preserve and pass on the ancient traditions. New, formalised forms of musical notation were introduced from the Cyrodiilic symphonic composers into the bardic practices in order to share music, and to prevent the loss of yet more music. Learning a basic level of notation is a fundamental component of the Bard's College of Solitude's syllabus. Its importance in preserving the tradition cannot be understated (even if many nords will tell you they don't need to read music). The works of great bards of the time, such as Azzadal, kept bardic music popular among many citizens of Skyrim, and increasingly so over the rest of the Empire.

In recent years, travelling bards have flourished throughout the various lands of Tamriel; performing both old and new songs, bringing ancient stories of valour as well as news from the other provinces. The traditional instruments of lute, flute and drum are still popular, but others such as fiddles are becoming more popular among troupes of bards. 

The art of the bard has evolved over the years, but is still fundamental to Nordic life. To be a student of the bardic arts is to hold one of the most valued professions in Skyrim.
