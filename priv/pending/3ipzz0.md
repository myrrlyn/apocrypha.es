Magic, it means a longer life.
Author: Archon Elantri

As every young Man and Mer is taught from the start of their education, is that our world is filled with a energy called Magica. They are thought that this energy is all over Nirn, in the air, in the earth, in the water. Even in our blood. What is not mentioned is how this energy is capable of prolonging lifeâ€¦

People often hear about Mages and other Spellcasters living centuries longer than their race do. But why is this? Is it a spell? Is it an enchantment? Or is it something different?

In my other book ["Magica, How to store and recover it"](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/39hi8m/magica_how_to_store_and_recover_it/) i mentioned Blood magic. Blood magic is when a Spellcaster uses the Magica that is stored in blood. Is there a difference in how mutch Magica, blood can store? Yes it is. Young people often have more Magica in their blood than older people. Mer have more Magica in their blood than Men. 
The result of Mer having more Magica in their blood than Men, is that Mer live generaly longer lifes than men. The reason for this is simple, The more Magica one have in ones blood, the longer one will live.

Mages and other Spellcasters have dedicated their lifes to increase their ability to Store and recover Magica. 
Respectable Bloodmages, that was hired by The Septim Empire and the old Mages guild was tasked with recording the Magical potensial in races and how working as a spellcaster could affect the body. Not suprisingly they found out that Mer are born with more Magica in them than Men. The Bloodmages also found out that as a Spellcaster trains his Magica to recover faster and is able to store more of it. His blood also starts to contain more Magica in it.

Strong Mages and Spellcasters will not age as they would do had they not been a Mage or a Spellcaster, because of the simple reason that they have more Magica in their blood. This dont mean that Spellcasters become imortal and dont age, they just ages slower.  To truly become imortal, more drastic solutions are required.
