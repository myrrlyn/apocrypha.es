**The Crate, or an Account of Modern Dunmer Politics: Part 3**

*by Aso Indaren*

*Day 5*

Crossed Lake Boethiah today. The advice I got in Mothrivra worked, and the crate is still dry. I am finding it incredibly hard to stop my instincts getting the better of me and opening it, but I still remember Rathra's warning about relative curiosity. No sign of Helnim. To be frank, not much happened today. I managed to pick up enough food in Mothrivra to not have to hunt, and I couldn't see any fish in Lake Boethiah. I did manage to get some alchemy practice in, though – you don't need much for basic alchemy, just a pestle and mortar, and sources of water, ice and fire. The subsequent potion did alleviate my fatigue somewhat, so it looks like my test was successful.

Hopefully, I should reach the edge of the Helnim Fields by tomorrow, and Helnim proper the day after.


*Day 6*

Ground that doesn't drop away in front of me! Am I glad to see the back of those hills. I know I shouldn't really be writing that, seeing as it's only day six and I estimate it will take about a month to reach Narsis at this rate. I am grateful that this is Rain's Hand. I dread to think how hard it would be to make this journey were it Evening Star that this task has to be completed in. It is said that magicka is more powerful during Rain's Hand; I am not sure whether or not this is an old wives' tale, but if it made the crate wait for snowmelt, then so be it.

No sign of life today. The Boethian Mountains are treacherous. I am writing this, however, from the Helnim Fields, in the shadow of a small hillock southeast of Helnim itself. I have heard nothing but horror stories about the Imperial quarter of Helnim since their overlords lost control. Best not to leave the crate for more than half a second. The Telvanni quarter isn't impoverished, but it is full of sympathisers to the lord of Narrusa, so it's best avoided.

Back to my mental debate – try and find something to hunt, or steal from a recently bankrupted plantation?
