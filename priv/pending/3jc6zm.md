Part 1:  https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/3j9svg/the_secret_history_of_the_dragon_cult_part_1/

-------------

Seeming as part 1 was fairly well received, I'll type up some of the more general thoughts on basically record keeping, giving us all a more equal playing field too. Here's a collection of various sources and I've sorted them. Texts I think are useful are ones, which I would use to make arguments, as they're either verifiable or have no reason to be biased. 

Texts I think are useful:

Skorm Snow-Strider's Journal

Dragon Language: Myth no More

Atlas of Dragons, 2E 373

Annals of the Dragonguard

http://www.uesp.net/wiki/File:SR-misc-Harald_Plaque.png

Texts I think are interesting, though not necessarily true:

Amongst the Draugr (this one is annoying because I want it to be undoubtedly correct)

Ahzidal's Descent

Children of the All-Maker

Aevar Stone-Singer

The Guardian and the Traitor

Gratian's Journal

Varieties of Faith in the Empire

Children of the Sky

There Be Dragons by Torhal Bjorik 

Texts I think aren't useful:

The Dragon War by Torhal Bjorik

Etched Tablets (leading up to High Hrothgar)

Texts which exist, relating to barrows:
The Journals of Ralis Sedarys (tl;dr Ahzidal slowly sends the dude crazy)

The useful books are all fairly self-explanatory. The interesting books are just that, interesting but they lead to many larger ideas later. 

Now, the Dragon War is not a useful text. Note that the author is Torhal Bjorik. Read "There be Dragons" by the same author. He references Tiber Septim and so he is writing at least three eras after the Dragons ruled! Without the "The Dragon War" book, which essentially is speculation without evidence, I know of nothing suggesting that DaPanp were cruel masters. I'll go on about this in another post but I'll leave it open so that you all can dispute it.

The Etched Tablets (written after Tiber Septim) aren't useful because they're written by the Greybeards (again verifiably not contemporaries to the Dragon War) who were led by Paarthurnax. So did Kyne convince Paarthurnax to teach humans to shout? How convenient that Paarthunax is now a good guy because he's favoured by the gods! Yeah... right. You might be able to tell that I think that Paarthurnax influences events to make himself seem like a good guy. Who is there to argue against him? But that is for a later time as well, if at all. 

Based on the fact that King Harald is 13 generations after Ysgramor, if you call a generation 30 years and add a bit of speculation from Skorm Snow-Strider's journal (the Dragon cult was thought long extinct; c. 2-3 generations imo), you find out that DaPanp ruled from c. 300 years before the first Era to pretty much 0 1E. Yup, the Dragon civilisation did all they did in about 300 years. This timelining leads us to Alduin's Wall, which was finished in 1E 2812. I know it depicts accurately the events from (in lore) Elder Scrolls, as in the future events. My note of caution is that everything on the far left is still 2800 years out of date essentially.

That'll wrap things up for this one; not as exciting as the last one but it paves the way for the future. Feedback, questions et cetera. Until next time.
