**The Siege of City Hall, or the Rise of the Thalmor: Third day, Finale**

-

*As Magnus reaches its apex, so does the rage of the Council.*

-

**OGALMO:** Hecednil, you yourself called attention to the frailty of the City Hall parliament.

-

**HECEDNIL:** That I did, but defects can be fixed through sincerity and open discussion. The motives of the New Thalmor and its sympathisers can only be imposed, like a Thrassian plague.

-

**OGALMO:** Look then, look at how far open discussion has taken us in the past three days.

-

**OGALMO:** Relenya, perhaps you can help the Aldmeri-Tamrielic see reason through his degenerate morals.

-

**RELENYA:** Ogalmo, I shan’t pretend otherwise, and you know as well as anyone – I have no approval for you or your Cabal. Make no mistake.

-

**RELENYA:** But I have no love of the City Hall government either.

-

**RELENYA:** Hecednil, I regret having to tell you that you are the only mer in this room who still has faith in the Council. Whatever the outcome, Alinor will undergo enormous transition.

-

**RELENYA:** Still, we are of the same kind. I will stand by you in your steadfast effort to end this coup without giving into Lord General Naarifin.


-

**HECEDNIL:** Have we forgotten that the Ald-Altadon stands right here?

-

**EHKI:** You promote sincerity and open discussion, representative, and so do I.

-

**EHKI:** The Council must keep its integrity. It must go on.

-

*A guard slams her fist on the table, visibly shaken.*

-

**SECOND GUARD:** Who cares? We need to leave this place! We’re all going to die!

-

**OGALMO:** Calm yourself. I demand it. What’s happened to you all of a sudden?

-

**SECOND GUARD:** Death. I see Death. In the empty chair. And everywhere else. Death, over City Hall! Watch out!

-

**OGALMO:** Of course there is death; the street must be filled with riots by now! It’s no secret.

-

**HECEDNIL:** What did she say just then, though? Death, in the empty chair. That was…

-

*Shohil’s second representative runs from the basement into the main hall, stabs Ehki with a dagger and teleports outside the premise. The Ald-Altadon falls mortally wounded.*

-

**HECEDNIL:** Shohil, it’s his doing! Seize him! Guards. Why don’t you…

-

**FIRST GUARD:** At this point, I would rather not. And my fellow guard here seems to have fallen unconscious.

-

**RELENYA:** Stars above. Now, my friends, we have seen the real coup.

-

**HECEDNIL:** You speak as if you’ve seen a play. How can you care so little, Relenya?

-

**OGALMO:** Ignore him. Relenya. I heard rumours, in the past week, but I knew nothing. I swear that I took no part.

-

**RELENYA:** It matters not either way. What do you have to say for yourself, Shohil, you snake?

-

**SHOHIL:** I would rather let actions speak.

-

**OGALMO:** So they have. And look at our current state. The City Hall is shattered; we lost our only mediator, who kept order in a way that we had taken for granted.

-

**RELENYA:** When an Ald-Altadon is killed, even the heavens shall know. We cannot reconcile what just happened. Even if we still have the means to teleport, which we probably do not, there is no aid for us.

-

**HECEDNIL:** Have you all gone mad? Where is the fire? Shohil is the one responsible, tooth of the serpent.

-

**RELENYA:** I still stand with you. I have not gone mad. He and his secondary must pay; order calls for it.

-

**HECEDNIL:** He needs to die! Kill the snake!

-

*Hecednil picks up the dagger used to kill Ehki and rushes at Shohil with it. The first guard stops Hecednil, disarms him and kills him.*

-

**OGALMO:** Do you still take the side of a dead mer, Lady Relenya?

-

*Relenya remains silent, face in hands.*

-

**SHOHIL:** It seems that we are free. Come exile or reward, let the siege be over.

-

**SHOHIL:** Lord General Naarifin! Leader of the New Cabal of the Thalmor!

-

**SHOHIL:** The Council surrenders. Lower your ward; all is at your mercy.

-

*The ward vanishes. Naarifin enters through the main door with several City Guard behind him.*

-

**NAARIFIN:** My dear friends, you made the right decision.

-

**NAARIFIN:** Follow us to the ruins of Crystal-Like-Law. There we will ensure that your executions are swift, and that you all find salvation in the Imperishable Spirit.

-

**THE END**
