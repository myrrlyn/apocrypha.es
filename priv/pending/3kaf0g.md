A very brief timeline of the development of Bs'rii society.
***
##Dawn era

The Bs’r exist as simple insects, though nearly large as men, similar to the modern shalk. Their society is not yet formed, and their intelligence is minimal, animalistic.

##First Era

Within the planes of outer Oblivion, war rages endlessly, and amongst the squabbles Malacath is enraged by the theft of his glorious Savior’s Hide by his daedric cousin Hircine. For what passed as millenia within Ashpit, but mere moments in the Mundus, Malacath plotted to stick a thorn in Hircine’s side for his treachery when it hit him: The Hunt. And so Malacath who is and was *M’k’ts* took up the earth from beneath the insects of Wrothgar, and from his pre-written brethren the goblin-ken sewed the seeds of a new people (for, weak, he could not form a wholly new race without the aid of a pre-existing one). And so the *Bs’r* came to be, related more to the goblins than the elves they take their names from. Imbued with the same magics as his treasured *Scourge*, this new people, the Bs’r, were protected, and a bane to other daedric influences. They served Malacath as Hircine’s greatest nightmare: An unhuntable, unobtainable trophy he would never cherish as his own.

Some hundred or so years later, the first Wrothgarian societies of the Bs’r are formed, tribal and quick to anger when it came to outsiders. They were simple but just, and unwilling to compromise when it came to their Gods. Passively serving their purpose as Hircine’s bane, the Bs’r were mostly left alone by their creator, watched over only subtly and intermittently. Still, they cherished his memory and that of their betrayer-god, *H’r’as*.

It was during the first era that the Bs’r first had contact with the Iron Orcs of Craglorn and Southern Wrothgar, where they learnt the ways of the worship of the stones. Though they felt it odd, and unfitting to abandon their Gods for stones, they did take from the Iron Orcs the symbology of the earth, and their proclivity for vegetarianism. The *K’kshpa* Clan of the Bs’rii peoples were the first to form their pact with the Orcs of Wrothgar, to be left alone and share only material trade. The bonds formed there last to today, where Bs’r silk is often traded for *echiterre* milk. This meeting was also the mark of the end of their own personal era, which does not line up with that of the rest of Tamriel. The first era of the Bs’r ended in Tamrielic year 1E 780.

##Second Era

After centuries of disjointed tribal rule, the region of Wrothgar eventually came under dual control of High Rock and the emergent proto-Orsinium. The Orcs were sympathetic with the Bs’r and continued to leave them alone for the most part, though trade routes expanded and became more militaristically controlled. The most prominent leader who dealt with the Orcs was Bs’rii *Ts’r*, a diplomat and alchemist who had become the head of the largest tribe of Bs’r in the region. He’d spent some time within Orsinium and had planned trips to High Rock, though they were deemed too dangerous. The caution displayed would prove well-warranted after the 2E massacre of the K’kshpa clan by the Bretons occurred in the year 354 and continued on until 360. High Rock’s massacre drastically reduced their existence, leaving them a shell of what they were. Ts’r wrote, in his native tongue, that the K’kshpa were, in his own words, “laid to rest.” The region was later controlled once again by larger Orsinium, with assistance from the Iron Orcs, where the few remaining Bs’r were able to prosper and regain some of their lost territory, though not nearly enough to restore their old holds.


Unfortunately for the Bs’r war was once again on the horizon, when in 2E 2300, or Tamrielic 2E 350, the beginnings of religious schism would plague Orsinium. When the Orcish church began to devote itself to the once-thought-lost Trinimac, there was uncertainty amongst the population as to whether this new sect would vie for the Bs’rii’s continued existence. A new leader of the now-titled *K’shr*, Ts’pa would travel to Orsinium to beg for continued trade and peace. Successful, Ts’pa and the greater K’shr clan were granted sovereignty within Wrothgar, and the title of *Patriarch of the Native Species*. This ended the second Bs’rii era.

##Third Era

The Third Era was the start of the largest population of diaspora since the orcs. The Bs’rii population began to shift its position starting at the end of the first era, but it wasn’t until 3E 100 that they began to move in larger numbers. The colonized areas included Hammerfell, Valenwood and parts of western Elsweyr. Far-southern Blackmarsh also housed smaller nomadic clans, who would stop there during the winter months. The Bs’rii third era has continued into the modern Tamrielic fourth era, up until 4E year 15.
