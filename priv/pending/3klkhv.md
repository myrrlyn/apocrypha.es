"My belly is full of the souls of your fellows, Dovahkiin."

"Dovahkiin! Use Dragonrend, if you know it!"

"JOOR ZAH FRUL!" The Thu'um slammed into Alduin's torso, and the World-Eater collapsed onto the snow. His head reared up, eyes scarlet and unblinking.

"Paarthurnax. Has it come to this? We were allies once, you know."

Hunter's mentor sighed. "Yes, I served you, Alduin. What of it?"

The Devourer's gaze narrowed. "Ah, I see. You don't remember, then."

Hunter Shouted again. Fire breath. Alduin recoiled, but stood his ground. "We were all such good friends. Back when I was you and you were dov and the end was me. It didn't last, though, did it? I was just...so hungry. YOL!"

The Last Dragonborn rolled to the side on his tail as a flaming stream passed through the air beside him. "I'm going to end you, Alduin. This kalpa will last forever."

The dragon roared, knocking Hunter back with his jaw. Alduin seemed nearly morose. "...yes. That's what I thought, too. But the gods have a way of differing with the likes of you."

Hunter gasped for breath, raising his shield just in time for a shard of ice to bounce off it. "Paarthurnax! I could use some help here!"

The aging Tsaesci raised a hand, sending a firebolt into Alduin's side. "I will do what I can, Dovahkiin. But I am not the fighter I once was."

The massive black dragon laughed bitterly. "Oh, how true that is. It pains me to see you both like this, you know. Wingless, crawling. A mortal mockery of the dov. But I have none to blame but myself."

Hunter cried out, dashing forward and burying his blade in the grounded dragon's neck. Alduin snapped at him, but pulled back, taking to the air as Dragonrend's effects wore off.

"Your Thu'um is strong. The time of your victory is near, my old servant. I don't know how you'll find me -- you have no dov to use as I did. But you will. The cycle will continue.

"Farewell, Winged-Snow-Hunter."
