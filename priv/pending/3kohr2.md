###TEM Designate Nu_Aldmeris [M4553R] 
 
###Solaris Aurbical Starfleet Command 
 
###6E700, ALDMER [IS] Ward-Soul Frequency 46 
 
There have been multiple reports of Aurbic-Temporal Ruptures on one of the remaining Chunks of the Old Word. 
 
The first signs of a temporal shift began not a few hours ago. Some of the readings have already been terminated due to lack of credibility. However early reports were able to pinpoint the starting time of the temporal anomaly. It seems to be from an Erased Era. I request that you inquire into that date that I have provided below, to attempt to pinpoint the source of the anomaly. 
 
###TEM Designate Solaris Aurbical Starfleet Command 
 
###Nu_Aldmeris House of Akagrog 
 
###6E700, ALDMER [IS] Ward-Soul Frequency 55 
 
The House of Akagrog orders the Solaris Aurbical Starfleet to stand down and vacate their current location and remain within at least 20 Arcs away from Nirn. The House has decided to share some information with you, but be mindful as it is intended for your eyes only. 
 
The Temporal Anomalies from the Erased Era are Dwemeri in origin. In the year 1E700 the Dwemeri disappeared. No one that the House is aware of has found any remains of them, until now. It would seem that their disappearance was nothing but a basic temporal shift. This is peculiar as temporal shifts have only now become a commercially used source and the Dwemeri were apparently thousands of years ahead of their time. 
 
As history states that they never returned, we must keep the Dwemeri in this time period. However this would, as you very well know, anger the Akagrog, so we must at the very least rename them. The House has decided that once the Dwemeri are organized, they will be officially titled the Atmer. You will refer to them in any text as the Atmer. After reading this text, The House kindly requests that you dispose of this document permanently.
