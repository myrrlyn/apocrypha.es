The Temporal Warp has occurred. It would seem that the House is in need of ships to transfer the Atmer to a safe location. The House would like to make a request to the AS_Solaris to shift to a distance of 2 Arcs away from Nirn, and our Carriers will escort all of the Atmer to your starships. You would then proceed to shift to Masser, where you will locate yourselves within 2 Arcs of the coordinates below. If you decline, the House strictly prohibits you from disclosing any of this information. If you accept, however, we urge need you to reply or shift to the location provided above within 3 cycles.

I have agreed to your terms, and am currently preparing to shift to the specified location. As promised, everyone is prepared to sign the Act. There is room for approximately 20,091,301 persons on board the 30,000 ships. Boarding will likely take about two days. As this letter arrives, we are expecting to shift within the next couple of hours. The House would also like to know that the Queens are interested in seeing what has caused the temporal shift, but I have delayed their agents for now. However later it might come into the Houseâ€™s hands to decide whether the Atmer are to be made public or kept in secret.
