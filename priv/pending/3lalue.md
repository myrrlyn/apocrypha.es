&amp;nbsp;

Below are listed the details and conversations had at the first conference with the newly-established “Atmeri Tribe-Clans”, which will now be occupying an area of 3 Arcs on the surface of Secunda. The Atmer are to be treated with great care for the next 3 over-cycles, and will be cared for by the House of Akagrog. They will also be provided the needed transportation to and from Secunda, and for that the services of the Solaris Starfleet K1 have been acquired. 

&amp;nbsp;

These records are presented by Kanarthis Jo’darro, archiver of the New Aldmeris Library of Lore.

&amp;nbsp;

*The conference hall contains the leader of New Aldmeris: Voladil Anaedor, two representatives of the House of Akagrog: Arquel Laemour and Angoldil Saelinaire. The Atmeri leaders are as follows: Klamac, Karg, and Blavnak*

&amp;nbsp;

*The present individuals sit down*

&amp;nbsp;

Voladil: Welcome, Atmeri peoples, to the Conference Hall. Here we will discuss your current position—

&amp;nbsp;

Blavnak: Silence you damn Altmer, before we proceed with this, me and my colleagues would like to know, what is the meaning of these markings?

&amp;nbsp;

Voladil: I don’t quite understand… markings?

&amp;nbsp;

Karg: Oh, don’t pretend to be blind, you sack, the markings on our bodies, the markings on the walls and the floors and the ceilings and the ground? 

&amp;nbsp;

Voladil: I don’t see any markings.

&amp;nbsp;

*There are whispers among the Altmeri.*

&amp;nbsp;

Arquel: None of us see any markings.

&amp;nbsp;

Klamac: That is most peculiar.

&amp;nbsp;

Angoldil: Please, can you describe the markings to us?

&amp;nbsp;

Karg: They are very hard to describe. They are so close together that you can barely see. They glow of a sweet orange color.

&amp;nbsp;

*Karg brings his arm close to his head*

&amp;nbsp;

Karg: It seems like… Some kind of… Dragon? No, two dragons… Facing each other and breathing fire onto some kind of figure between them.

&amp;nbsp;

*There is silence from the Altmer. Their faces are frozen in horror.*

&amp;nbsp;

Arquel: It… It cannot be… I though it impossible, but now it seems like…

&amp;nbsp;

Klamac: Well?! What is it?

&amp;nbsp;

Voladil: It’s… Akatosh.

&amp;nbsp;

Angoldil: But… two of them?

&amp;nbsp;

Voladil: We must ponder on this… The conference is suspended for until next morning.
