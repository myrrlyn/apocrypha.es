"The unarmed, unarmored martial arts traditions of the Marshmerrow, Salt Rice, and Golden Reed societies of the Dissident Priest, patterned on the 'Rain-of-Sand' fighting styles of Elsweyr, are slow to be adopted in the Empire, associated as they are with the ascetic renunciation of worldly wealth and material goods, and the rigid disciplines and mystical philosophies so alien to the Imperial West." - Morrowind Dialogue

According to this, the Dissident Priests have various martial arts styles, with similarities to those of the Khajiit. These are not featured in-game, so I've been thinking about what they would be like.

I'd imagine that the Akaviri martial arts are more like Karate, Judo and other Japanese fighting styles, as their influences are often from that area (Samurai, Kiai, the architectural style etc.). Therefore, Khajiit ones are probably not the same. They could be more of an equivalent to Kung Fu, with their many different sub-styles. I think the Khajiit martial arts are likely a bit more original than a straight Kung Fu rip-off though. More claw based attacks and probay tail based things as well. 

The Dunmer clearly can't do claw and tail attacks as they don't have either feature. However, there is a Morrowind-era Dunmer concept art (I think it is on the morrowind dunmer uesp page) that shows a Dark Elf in a martial arts-esque stance with hands in a claw like shape. The attacks could still resemble the Khajiit claw attacks without utilizing real claws. 

Another parallel between Dissident Priest fighting styles and those of Kung Fu is the spiritual nature of the two. Many forms of Kung Fu, such as those practiced by Shaolin Monks involve meditation and are intertwined with their lifestyle. Something similar likely happens with the Dissident Priests whose martial arts and religion seem to be linked. 

I like to think that something that distinguishes them would be the use of magic in the dunmer styles. Spells that affect speed, agility, jumping etc. would all be useful in hand-to-hand combat. There could even be a magic version of the one-inch punch involving a short but powerful fortify strength spell when punching to make it more powerful. 

I doubt that it would be just like Kung Fu, but I think these martial arts are based on it, from what the evidence suggests. There isn't much on them though as far as I'm aware, so if I missed anything, let me know. Do any of you have another idea on what these fighting styles are like?
