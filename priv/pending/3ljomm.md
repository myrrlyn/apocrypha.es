*Everyone reenters the conference room. This time there is another Dwemeri leader with them. He is sitting in a wheelchair and is held with straps. There are two black soul gems on either side of his wheelchair.*

&amp;nbsp;

Voladil: Who is this? Why did you bring him into the conference?

&amp;nbsp;

Klamac: He could be the only person that could help us solve this problem with the markings.

&amp;nbsp;

Arquel: I take it that you know that we were unsuccessful?

&amp;nbsp;

Angoldil: Then tell us, who is this, and why is he strapped in?

&amp;nbsp;

Klamac: You have not guessed? This is the founder of the Numidium Project, Kagrenac.

&amp;nbsp;

*The Aldmer jolt and look over at Kagrenac. His body is covered in the markings that Karg described. Angoldil later explained that he looked into Kagrenac’s eyes, and found that they had no iris. “I could not look away, as disturbing as it was. His eyes seemed to be dragging me inside, and I felt like something was whispering into my ear. Suddenly I felt a jolt, and looked away from the eyes. It was Arquel shaking me.”*

&amp;nbsp;

Angoldil: His eyes...

&amp;nbsp;

Karg: I do not suggest looking into his eyes again.

&amp;nbsp;

Voladil: Why can we see the markings on him, but not on anything else?

&amp;nbsp;

Blavnak: We are unsure; however we feel that we could find out why.

&amp;nbsp;

Blavnak: We have been told that you have a machine that can translate anything into any language?

&amp;nbsp;

Voladil: Yes, why?

&amp;nbsp;

Blavnak: They I suggest you turn it on.

&amp;nbsp;

*Voladil waves an arm to one of the people sitting at the control board. The man activates the Translator*

&amp;nbsp;

Blavnak: Good, now, my colleagues?

&amp;nbsp;

*The Dwemeri stand up. Karg and Klamac ready their hands near the soul gems. Blavnak undoes the strap that is preventing Kagrenac from standing up. Immediately Klamac and Karg grab the soul gems, and pull them out of their stands in the wheelchair.  All of the markings on Kagrenac start glowing, and his eyes produce a bright red light. He screams and then proceeds to shout something in an unknown language. Afterwards the glow in his eyes spreads and the others cannot help but avert their eyes. When the light has died down, everyone looks at the wheelchair and finds that Kagrenac is gone.*
