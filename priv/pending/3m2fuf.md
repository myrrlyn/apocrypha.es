Voladil: What have you done? Where is Kagrenac?!

&amp;nbsp;

*The Atmer are already walking towards the Translator. Seeing this, the Altmer start walking in the same direction*

&amp;nbsp;

Karg: Is it translated?

&amp;nbsp;

Translator: Yes, should I play it now?

&amp;nbsp;

Voladil: Go ahead.

&amp;nbsp;

*Everyone crowds around the Translator to listen to the recording.*

&amp;nbsp;

RECORDING: *scream* YOU HAVE COLLAPSED THE AKATUSK. YOU HAVE DESTROYED US ALL. BEWARE THE HOUSE OF MOVE-LIKE-THIS.

&amp;nbsp;

*The Altmer suddenly jump away from the Atmer.*

&amp;nbsp;

Karg: What does this mean? *Looking at the Altmer* what are you doing?

&amp;nbsp;

Angoldil: This… We’re sorry…

&amp;nbsp;

Arquel: Before we tell you this… We really are sorry…

&amp;nbsp;

Blavnak: *shouting* what is the meaning of this?! I demand an explanation at once!

&amp;nbsp;

Arquel: Well… it’s hard to explain without using proper terms, but it would seem that Kagrenac was an anomaly. He… or it, somehow leaked through into this world from another… Kalpa? I forget the term used in the Erased Eras. Basically, because he leaked in from another Kalpa, none of these things were meant to happen. You see, every time a temporal shift is created nowadays, it punches a tiny hole through the Akatusk. These punctures can easily mend. However, because your temporal shift contained Kagrenac, you punched a hole the size of another world through the Akatusk. This means that the Akatusk is trying to mend itself in the only way that is possible, by removing you. I think that you have only a couple of hours, if not minutes to live.

&amp;nbsp;

Karg: I…

&amp;nbsp;

Blavnak: We shall see about this.

&amp;nbsp;

*The Atmer walk out of the room*
