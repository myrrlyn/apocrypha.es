Heroes. They appear in the world of Nirn at times of immense need. Sent in with a destiny to battle the great, but varied evils of the times. But are they different? All seem to have an immense amount of power, and have similar origins, as prisoners, nobodies. Without family, without history, and most importantly, without skills.

Every single profession or lifestyle requires skill to some degree. Even farmers would need strength and stamina to work out in the fields all day. And yet, these heroes enter the world with nothing, nothing but the skills their races are known to have a natural affinity with. The heroes of the elder scrolls are brought into the world by the divines, there and then. With one purpose. One destiny.

This is an aspect they all share. Their stories all start the same way. They also end in the same way. These heroes of immense power don't become Leaders. They don't become living Gods, like the Tribunal. They merely vanish, with nothing known of them but the effect of their good deeds.

These similarities all seem to point in the direction my theory. But we have to ask: Why? 

To answer that question, you have to look at the bigger picture. The Gods of Aetherius have existed and observed the mortal plane long enough to witness threats of all kinds. Invasions from Oblivion, and even the return of the dragons. By this point, the Divines know that one day they will face a foe even these champions cannot defeat. Unless, they're all the same. Unless these heroes that have saved Tamriel in its times of greatest need are all reincarnations of the same, incredibly powerful soul. This is not known to each incarnation of the hero or anyone else, for it is the secret weapon of the Divines. A weapon to be used only in the time of greatest need for Aetherius or Mundus. Landfall, a theory believed by many, involves the Nerevarine returning to hold back the Numidium to save the lives of those trying to leave for the moons. This is just one example of how a figure of immense power might be exactly what the Divines need to save Mundus. A single, united soul consisting of all these heroes would be as powerful as, or more powerful than the Gods themselves. Indeed, the hero might actually be an avatar of one of the Gods! (linking back to my LDB = Akatosh idea).

But, unfortunately, there is one detail, one aspect of a certain hero's story that allegedly disproves such a theory. The Champion of Cyrodiil mantles Sheogorath. And indeed, this is true. It is shown in the Shivering Isles during TES IV, and dialogue from Sheogorath in TES V does indeed imply that he can recall the CoC's ventures in Tamriel). But, what if something, or someone else, then went on to take the CoC's place? He'd still be able to remember the actions of the Hero of Kvatch, but it doesn't have to be him. Following my theory, this is the only time that the Divines are halted in taking back the hero. And it just so happens to also be the largest gap in between two of these heroes. 200 years, enough time for another to take the CoC's place and have him returned to the grasp of the Divines.

Perhaps this theory is plausible, perhaps it breaks a million rules of the lore I did not consider. I, however, believe it to be a considerable possibility, and hope to hear the thoughts of my fellow scholars here at Teslore. :)
