I feel like the Aurorans from KOTN weren't expanded upon enough. Here's my ~~C0DA~~ headcanon about them.

Origins

The Aurorans are, perhaps, the most unusual variety of Daedra, in that they were once, like Meridia, Magna-Ge (i.e. Aedra that fled with Magnus). Meridia convinced these Magna-Ge to join her in making a deal with the Daedra. Meridia was the strongest, so the rest of them became lesser Daedra, a fact that they resent.

Personality

Aurorans are impulsive, emotional creatures. They are very high strung. They will stubbornly pursue a goal so much that it has the opposite effect. If it fails to achieve its goal, it will often times first blame everyone else involved, then blame only itself. They are naturally curious, and will go to any ends to find out what others are hiding. It has been said that controlling Aurorans is like herding cats.


Society

Like Dremora society, there are castes in Auroran society. Unlike Dremora society, there are only two, the Merid-Ara (Meridiaâ€™s Aurorans) and the Mund-Ara (Normal Auroran). The Merid-Ara are viewed by the Mund-Ara as pompous and subservient, and the Merid-Ara view the Mund-Ara as misguided and irreverent.
