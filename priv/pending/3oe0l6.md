[The original](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/3o9osb/on_the_aurorans/)

Physiology

The Auroran's armor is its skin. Underneath, they are a mixture of machine and organism, like the fabricants of Sotha Sil, or (ironically) Pelinal Whitestrake.

Colored Rooms

A map of the Colored Rooms would resemble a [Color Chart](http://imgur.com/iI07nuT), with each of the "rooms" being a region, much like Sheogorath's Mania and Dementia. Meridia resides in the white area.
