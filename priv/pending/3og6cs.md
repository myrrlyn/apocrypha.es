The Colored Rooms are islands, separated by rivers, forming the shape of a threefold Venn Diagram.

Red Room

The red room is a vast [red rock desert](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8291/7657146528_138797a0a6_z.jpg). Some Aurorans live here.

Blue Room

The blue room is where many of the Ayleids, including Umaril the Unfeathered (who the Mund-Ara viewed as "the boss's kid that we have to treat nicely or we'll get fired") who worshiped Meridia went when they died.

Yellow Room

Ara-Se, the center of Mund-Ara culture, is located here. Many of the denizens follow Nahmay (their version of Magnus). As such, Nahmay has become a common Auroran name. (Aurorans, like Argonians, change their name every once and a while.) 

Green Room

The green room is a vast sprawling plain, mainly used as ranch area. (The Aurorans eat jufor, a large land owl.)

Orange Room

The orange room, an eternally autumnal region, is a popular area for vacations among Mund-Ara.

Purple Room

The purple room is where many of Meridia's favored Merid-Ara live in luxury.

White Room

The white room contains Merid-Se, Meridia's capital. Meridia resides in the Tower of Light, a tower in the center of Merid-Se.
