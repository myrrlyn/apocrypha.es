[from “Theo-social Ramifications of Diasporic Faith with Regards to the Miracle of Union”]
[by Fuscius Sacronius, Imperial Seminary, Imperial City; 6E 131]

“…and thus did the Diaspora come to Masser and find their gods waiting for them. 

“It cannot be overstated the effect this had upon religious practice.  As Brother Kuxor observed millennia ago, the gods are affected by the Belief placed in them – or more specifically, the Faith.  Faith and Certainty are antithetical to one another and sitting next to an inebriated Talos opining his lot in the universe did not, you may imagine, aid in the fostering of Belief.  Despite continuing faithfulness among the Khajiit, it was not long after the Blessed Amaranth that the gods withdrew from public life.

“But it was not until the Miracle of Union – the unlooked-for healing of Nirn – that the gods truly disappeared.  Theologians have attempted to explain this in the ensuing centuries but no ready explanation satisfies.  The return of verifiable miracles suggests that – in ways difficult to understand – the loosing of Memory (and the Return of Men) has led to a kind of renaissance among the gods.  As one Khajiit philosopher put it, ‘They have become, again, what we needed them to be – and that through their absence.’

“We turn now to the Cult of Mnem and its spurious connections with the Zero Temple…”
