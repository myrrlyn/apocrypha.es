Atmora is a strange land. And yet, so little is now known about it. This ancient home of both man and mer in different points of history is now a great mystery, even to the Nordic people. There are some who would claim that Atmora is frozen in time, that nothing moves, nothing changes. I think otherwise, I think that that is an illusion, and masks an incredible truth.

All the Continents of Nirn are actually different Kalpas, different realities. Akivir is the future, Yokuda is the past, Tamriel is the present. So what about Aldmeris (if it even exists) and Atmora? Well, to start off with, we need to look at the Dragons.

The Dragons are all individual shards of Aka, of time. The largest of these Shards, Auriel, Akatosh, and Alduin, are all embodiments of the creation, the sustainment, and the destruction of reality. The dragons, shards of time left over when Aka was smashed like the glass of a window. These tiny shards, however, can come together, and form a bigger piece, a more significant piece, even if they're not repaired.

And that is how Atmora works. The Dragons of Tamriel and Akivir have faced persecution on a mass scale. Who's to say many did not escape to the frozen north? To Atmora? Where the Dovah could exist without fear of being killed by the evil mortals who once worshipped them. Atmora is a safe haven, out of the reach of men, mer, and beast. The return of Dragons to Tamriel was more than just resurrection at the hands of Alduin. Some were literally returning from the North, from their exile. It is reasonable to believe that there are hundreds, if not thousands of dragons still in Atmora. So, what effect would that have? 

If dragons are literally shards of time, and all these shards of time were together, what events would unfold? Millions of possibilities and interpretations and ideas, all linked together through time, would come together, and all happen at once. So many things that were, will be, and could be are all happening at the same time. It's a Dragon Break. Should the Dragons come together in such concentration, it would be a Dragon Break beyond mortal comprehension! Perhaps beyond even that of the Gods! So, how could any of these lowly beings, in comparison to time itself, look at it and make sense? Even the smallest dragon breaks amass such confusion that *sense of time itself is lost*

And that's what's happening to Atmora. It is in another Kalpa, beyond our own, yet to venture there, you would see nothing. Nothing would change. Nothing would move. The land would be without time. Because, paradoxically, there was so much time there. So many ideas and possibilities, all existing at once, the very concept is so extremely unbelievable that it cannot be seen. Atmora being frozen in time is an illusion, an illusion because, as far as even the original spirits can see, they cannot even begin to imagine so much of time at once. Maybe they used to, but their power has diminished, and as the dragons flee to Atmora in fear of death, and the Great Dragon Break of Atmora becomes increasingly impossible, they cannot see. It is an illusion. An illusion hiding a mst devastatingly impossible event. Atmora is all-time, Atmora is no time.

So what about Aldmeris? If this land even exists, where does it stand on this spectrum of time? It's lost, as they all say. But it goes far deeper than that. The land is lost in time, for they are looking at Atmora. Atmora and Aldmeris, order and chaos, change and no change, stillness and eternal movement. Geographically, to look at one from the other, is to look through the centre of the Aurbis itself. I believe Aldmeris sees Atmora for what it is. And merely viewing the truth of Atmora has lost the land. Even its physical existence, lost, as they look grudgingly at their polar (pardon the pun) opposite, that by all laws of reality should not exist.

Yokuda is past-time. Tamriel is present-time. Akivir is Future-time. Aldmeris is lost-time. And Atmora is found-time. Atmora is lost-time. Aldmeris is found=time.
