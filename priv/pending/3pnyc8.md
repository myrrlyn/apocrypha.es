The Divines of this Aetherius are directly responsible for the creation of Mundus, and lost a great deal of their power in order to create the magnificent world known as Nirn. And indeed, the Daedra, who were barely, or not at all, involved in the creation of this world, lost absolutely nothing that they did not gain back, and have themselves gone on to benefit from this world.

And yet, the Aedra benefitted more. The Divines are subject to the force of Mythopoeia, and enjoy widespread popularity across all of Tamriel, and possibly beyond. They are worshipped far more than the Daedra could even hope for. Mortal belief is powerful, and I personally think that this will have a great effect on the power of the Divines.


We've also got to consider whether Nirn and its inhabitants' very essence influences Aedric power. After all, the Divines gave a great deal of their power to create the world, but what if it's far more complicated than that, and Nirn is still based directly off their energies? The Aedra, I believe, still have an active role in sustaining the world. This describes my views very well: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/3i8pzf/how_conscioussentient_are_the_aedra/cuejmh9

I also began to think about the stars. They are holes between Aetherius and Mundus, and yet, we only seem to think that Magicka goes into Mundus from these gaps. What if it goes the other way round? What if magical and soul power goes through from Mundus back to Aetherius. This would explain how souls get to the Dreamsleeve and their afterlives, but I admit also begins to question whether the population of Nirn is increasing or decreasing. The Older wars seem to be far more important and grand, so, for me, this may suggest that the population has gradually decreased and soul energies have returned to Aetherius. The Divines are in charge of these immortal planes absolutely, is the power in these lands not at their disposal, and so, for all extensive purposes, theirs to use?

A primary argument against all of this is that the Aedra are sleeping, dead, and do not involve themselves with mortal affairs because they cannot. In no way is this true. The comment I used above is applicable to this argument, but I'd also like to mention the Daedra, who are primarily compared with them in this particular aspect. So, why do the daedra intervene? Well, most of the time, it's for ambition, entertainment. They meddle in mortal affairs because mortals are far more interesting than their Daedric followers. They seek to pursue their own ambitions and have fun, usually twisted. If not, they do it for the good of the world (Azura, Meridia)

But the Divines created this world so that there may be an existence free from the anarchy of Anu and Padomay, and their constant arguing. To save themselves and others from the chaos and madness of ANU. That is why Mundus was created. So, if the world was created to be different from the lands under the control of the Aedra, whom are far closer to these original forces than mortals, then why would they 
interfere and seek to make the land of Nirn their own? Divine intervention, apart from extreme cases, would be foolish.

And Divine intervention is an important topic, because that's how we gain a proper judgement on how powerful the Gods really are. There are 3 Divines that have been known to play a massive part on the World of Nirn's existence. First off, we have Kyne, or Kynareth, who used her powers to allow humans to learn the voice, through Paarthurnax. To turn such an evil dragon from domination to teaching is an incredible feat, not one that should be overlooked. Akatosh is known for pacts with mortals of many occasions. It was he who made the pact of the Amulet of Kings. It was he who battled (and won against, bear that in mind) Mehrunes Dagon, and won. It was he who produced a Dragonborn capable of defeating Alduin himself. Akatosh is far more powerful than many would imagine.

And lastly, there is Talos. As a man, he united the lands under the Imperial Empire, achieved CHIM, used Numidium, and mantled Lorkhan. Even today, he holds Mundus together in place of the towers. He is one of the, if not the most, powerful being that has ever existed on Nirn, Aetherius, and Oblivion.

3 examples of Gods and Goddesses who are Divines, using immeasurable power to save the world from Tyrannt and Oppression, including that of one of the most powerful Daedra. There is one more point I'd like to address.

Nirn

This planet is the creation of the Gods, and in its time, many apocalyptic events have been prevented, and the bringers of destruction defeated, often without Divine Intervention. But that's the exact point. The Aedra were capable of creating a world, that, in itself, and in its people, possess and produces such vast amounts of power one can barely comprehend. This incredible work of ingenuity was the work of the Divines. It is through Nirn that aspects of time itself have failed to defeat them, it is through Nirn that the divided Princes of Oblivion have failed to truly take over this land, and it is through Nirn that for years to come, many more victories over the Gods and Goddesses, Divine and Daedric, will take place. This was the creation of the Aedra. And it always will be.
