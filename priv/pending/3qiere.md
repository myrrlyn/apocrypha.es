*Author’s preface: … Special thanks to Marcius Carvain, for allowing me to update and prepare a second edition of his guide, which was greatly helpful to me in navigating Skyrim…*


...


The great trade city of Whiterun sits on a large hill in the centre of Skyrim. Due to its central location, it is an extremely wealthy city. Most, if not all, of the trade in Skyrim passes through Whiterun at least once.


The first thing that strikes a traveller to Whiterun is how large and sprawling it is. Due to enduring years of peacetime trade, the city has spilled past its own walls and into the countryside. The city of Whiterun does not start from the city gates. Instead, the city begins in the farms, tradehouses, shophouses and stables that surround its outer walls. Out here, a curious traveller can find all manner of trinkets, baubles, foodstuffs and services for the right coin. These outposts feed off the main trade of Whiterun, like a minnow trails a shark for a leaving or two. It is also out here, in the little towns and hamlets dotting the countryside, that one can find Khajiti caravaneers, calling out their wares with a wink and a nod.


It is often a long wait to enter the city of Whiterun. A traveller is advised to be early, or have no urgent plans. A long queue often snakes from the city gates down to the base of the hill. The guardsmen are methodical and careful in their searches, and one cannot enter the city without paying the proper taxes and fees.


Whiterun itself is split into three districts. The Plains District is the largest, and sits at the base of the hill just past the city gates. It is Whiterun’s poorest district, but it is poor only in relative terms, as even Whiterun’s humblest is still richer than some other hold cities! The one defining trait of the Plains District is how noisy and full of people it is. The din is inescapable – the calls of traders in the wide marketplace, the heated exchanges between merchants haggling over prices, the striking of metal from the forges – and the city never truly rests as many stores still stay open or vendors continue to ply their trade even after the sun has set.


The Wind District is Whiterun’s more affluent neighbourhood, and is accessible through a wide stone stairway by the main marketplace. The richer citizens of Whiterun live in the Wind District, and their wealth is quietly displayed in their houses’ intricately carved wooden posters and doors, or by their flourishing gardens and flower beds. The Wind District is also notable for the large mead hall of the Companions, a brave and legendary company of fighting men and women who trace their histories to Ysgramor himself.


Sitting above the rest of Whiterun, both literally and metaphorically, is the Cloud District. The Cloud District is home to the nobles and great men and women of Whiterun. The fortress of Dragonsreach, the seat of the Jarl, is also located in the Cloud District. I had the advantage of being invited to a banquet hosted by the Jarl, and I must admit that it was a wonderful palace. While not as ostentatious or openly rich as the Blue Palace in Solitude, or as solemn and grand as the Dwemer-ruins of Markath, Dragonsreach’s high roofs and open perches are awe-inspiring in their own way.



Notable locations in Whiterun:


**In the Plains District:**


* **Warmaiden**, a new but well-regarded smithy that sells quality metal goods. Despite its name, this shop sells more than implements of war. The husband and wife who run the smithy are taciturn but helpful. An interesting tidbit I learnt was that the wife may be related to the Jarl’s steward.


* **The Drunken Huntsman**, a hunting needs specialty shop. The proprietor, Elrindir, and his brother Anoriath also hunt, and give away a small bag of elk jerky with every purchase from their store.  


* **Arcadia’s Cauldron**, an apothecary and pharmacy near the main marketplace. A special thank you to the proprietor, Arcadia, for diagnosing an early case of Ataxia for me and recommending an effective (if pricey) remedy.


* **Belethor’s General Goods**, the largest provisions shop in Whiterun. The owner, Belethor, may be a smarmy rat-faced Breton, but the collection of goods in his warehouse is the most well-stocked in the Plains District.


* Just off the main marketplace, the **Bannered Mare**. According to the locals, this is an institution in the city. It is a large, two-storey inn and restaurant. The owner, Hulda, is friendly and warm, and she cooks a mean lamp chop (which she says is sourced locally by Anoriath). She brings in ales and meads from around the region, and the Honningbrew Mead from the nearby meadery is a particular favourite. The Bannered Mare has a local bard who takes requests. Hulda also organises a bar quiz night every Fredas.

**In the Wind District**


* **The ~~Eldergleam~~ Gildegreen**, a large sacred tree in the middle of the district. 


* **The Temple of Kynareth**, a grand temple dedicated to the goddess. It has an impressive worship hall, and services on Loredas and Sundas are often packed with people. Of interest are the little pools in the worship hall, which are filled with discarded coins. Apparently pilgrims have a habit of dropping septims into the pools as an offering to the goddess for good luck.


* **Jorrvaskr**, the mead-hall of the Companions. The building looks like an overturned ship, and I am told that this is exactly what it was. Past the courtyard of Jorrvaskr is the amazing **Skyforge**, which according to the smith, Eorlund Gray-mane, was an ancient forge that was purportedly here even before the Companions arrive. The quality of Skyforged steel is clearly superior, but a price-conscious traveller may wish to shop at Warmaiden's instead. 


**In the Cloud District**

* **Dragonsreach**, the seat of the Jarl himself. Only the great hall in Dragonsreach is open to the public, as this is where the Jarl receives petitioners, dispenses justice, and hosts feasts for honoured guests. The dragon skull above the Jarl's throne is particularly impressive.


* Security is tighter in the Cloud District than in the other districts. However, one can find various perches from which to look out into the rest of hold.
