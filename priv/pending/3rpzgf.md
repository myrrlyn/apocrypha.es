Werebears are Lycanthropes, people that can turn into humanoid beasts. Lycanthropy was originally created by the Daedric Prince Hircine, and these man-beasts populate his realm known as the Hunting Grounds. The condition (Sanies Lupinis) is contagious and  being bitten or scratched by a Lycanthrope causes one to contract it.  

The condition has no well known cures if not treated immediately. As well as it causing the infected to transform, often uncontrollably for the first few times, it also causes physical changes to the person in their normal form. They assume some of the traits of the animal they become. For example, Werebears and Werewolves will grow hair more aggressively than normal. Therefore, it is possible for a knowledgeable person to identify someone who is a Lycanthrope in their normal form.  

The first transformation is often uncontrollable, and most people end up giving in to their beastly instincts in that form. They also gain much more endurance and resistance to pain in their beast form, making it very hard to kill them. In the book *On Lycanthropy*, it is said that Lycanthropes have been found to occasionally eat roots and berries instead of meat, so it is possible that they attack people or animals out of instinct instead of for survival reasons. This might be to spread the condition.  

Werebears are found in cold regions in Tamriel, including Solstheim, northern Cyrodiil, northern High Rock, northern Morrowind, and most commonly in Skyrim. They are, in essence, people who transform into bipedal humanoid bears. In their beast form, they have large paws with five very sharp claws on each one, and also have a mouth full of sharp teeth with two large canines on the top row. They have brown fur covering their entire body. Their human form also lots of hair which grows in the typical places, such as the face, neck, chest, and arms. Werebears often travel in packs of three or more, ready to transform when there is danger. They have a predilection to honey in both normal and beast form, and honeycomb or stolen honey pots are often found on them. Venison is also a part of their appetite, and naturally, feral ones will attack and eat people. Nordic tradition holds, though, that Canis Root rubbed on the trees around an area will ward off Werebears. The reasons for this are unknown.
