Dear Tar-Meena

I had come across a god by the name of [Seth](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Gods_S) after browsing the Imperial Library and discovered the Brotherhood of Seth is rather popular, particularly in the Iliac Bay region. I find it strange that upon all my years as a Scholar, I'd not heard this name. At first I had assumed that Seth was a typo for Seht, the wizard lord of Morrowind, but I continued to come across it and became rather curious. I then found out there was a Brotherhood of Seth in the town of [REDACTED] in the province of [REDACTED]. I went inside and asked if I may have an interview with the High Priest and he agreed.

**Q. Who is Seth?**

Seth is the guardian who assures safe passage for the dreamers and the dead alike to the Obelisk of Dreams as we cross the Thorned River

**Q. The Obelisk of Dreams?**

A tower where the dead are cleansed of their misdeeds in life so they may live again

**Q. So you are regarding Necromancy?**

NO! Necromancy is the defiance of Seth. Necromancy takes the children of Seth and binds them to the bodies of the dead

**Q. Then what do you mean by "live again"?**

Research the Chimeri King of Resdayne and you shall know

**Q. What does Seth look like?**

He has no form. He is energy, much like your Imperial pantheon. We depict him as both alive and dead. His right is shining life used to traverse the Thorned River, his left to hold the head and dreaming.

**Q. How do you worship Seth?**

We make his job easier by spreading light from darkness. We keep people alive and spread the knowledge of Seth.

**Q. How can one communicate with Seth?**

Do you plan to join the Brotherhood of Seth?

Uh, no I do not.

Than I will take my leave.

I will need to look more into this god Seth, as he piques my curiosity, and is a rather strange and unique god compared to the others I've read about.

Your Student,

~Spits-Fire

I decided that since noone talks about Seth, that I shall try to incite more discussion about him. Seth is a god that appeared only in Arena and hasn't been talked about since. I managed to find a theory regarding Seth, that he is just another name for Sithis, but I found this theory rather boring and decided upon my own instead. I decided to base him on [Charon](http://tinyurl.com/6n8pujb) who carries the souls of the damned across the River Styx and Archeon, which I referenced as the Thorned River. In the myth of Charon, you need to pay him to get across the river with either an Obolus of Danake. Obolus is another word for Obelisk, which I referenced as the Obelisk of Dreams, which in turn is referenced as the Dream Sleeve. Hope you enjoyed
