It's my Cake Day today :D

NOTE: Yes I know it says Vaklok at the title and not Vahlok, my bad :D

The Dragon Mask "Konahrik" was never made for a particular dragon priest. The very possession of the mask depends entirely upon having the "support" of all the other Dragon Priests. For such a significant figure, it makes no sense that there is no specific history of this "Konahrik". No tomb or historical mention. The Missing Dragon Priest.

Except, of course, Konahrik is not missing. Konahrik is a title. The Warlord. A title and mask given to a figure of immense power in times of great need for the Dragon cult. And what was one of the greatest threats to the Dragon Cult? Miraak.

The first Dragonborn, allegedly. Regardless, he held significant power, perhaps even capable of defeating Alduin himself. Miraak took an area of Skyrim, with the help of several other Dragon priests, land now known as Solstheim. His dealings with Herma-Mora, combined with a great quantity of power from being Dragonborn and a Dragon Priest, made Miraak the biggest **individual** threat to the Dragon Cult. He needed to be stopped.

Enter Vahlok. One of the few Dragon Priests considered "Benevolent", Vahlok was also one of the most powerful figures in the history of Skyrim. His famous battle with Miraak was directly responsible for Solstheim becoming an island. Following this, Vahlok was made the ruler of Solstheim, and was sworn to **watch over the land for Miraak's return**. Remember that. Now, Vahlok was an incredibly good leader, inspiring both Dragons and Men. 

But how? How could a mere Dragon Priest be able to kill the First Dragonborn using knowledge gifted from the God of Knowledge himself? It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Vahlok had something(s) special about him. First off, he is the Konahrik. That explains the noticeable absence of a mask from Vahlok. It makes little to no sense that he would not have a mask. Konahrik was his mask. He was selected as the Warlord, and as well as that standing testament to his power, the mask itself could have an influence. Also, Vahlok was a good leader of dragons and men. He bridged the gap between the two, as was the primary function of the Dragon Priests. Vahlok was the perfect dragon priest, powerful and a good leader. Who else is better to make Konahrik?

But that's not enough, is it? Because after all, Miraak was more than just a servant of Herma-Mora, he was a Dragonborn too. To defeat Miraak in battle, Vahlok would require a similar amount of power. Vahlok was a Dragonborn. And back to being the perfect dragon priest, who better to bridge the gap but a powerful *Dragon Man*? 

Logically speaking, the way I see it anyway, Vahlok had to be a Dragonborn. It makes perfect sense and cleared up all these loose ends. 

But there are two issues. 

Issue number 1: Vahlok tries to attack the player in Solstheim, despite being "benevolent".

Issue Number 2: How come no soul was absorbed?

Both of these issues can be answered with the same point. Vahlok's soul wasn't there. What was left as an empty shell, a zombie. Everything that made up the soul was gone. So, we in place have a mindless dragon priest, without a soul. 

So where is the soul? Well, the soul is in the body of the Last Dragonborn. The Last Dragonborn is Vahlok reincarnate. But why? Why would Vahlok return now? Well, because Miraak is returning. And this undead body of Vahlok is nowhere near as powerful as it should be. Miraak has had thousands of years to gain more strength, whilst Vahlok has been asleep. In his current form, an undead lich form of a Dragon Priest is not enough to defeat the returning Miraak. But Vahlok swore an oath, potentially bound by ancient magics, to watch over Solstheim for the return of Miraak. He needs to fulfil his duty to the Dragon Gods of old. And so, he is returned, and reincarnated. And as fate goes, a Dragonborn returning at this point in time is directly tied to another prophecy, to the return of Alduin. Not only does this give the new Vahlok an opportunity to regain much strength, but it also makes sense, for a Konahrik, leader of the Dragon Priests, to return to the world just as the Leader of the Dragons does as well. 

But of course, we have the issue of the mask, hidden away. To get to it, one essentially requires the "support" of the Dragon Priests, all of them in fact, to unlock the mask. Would the Dragon priests not willingly give their masks to the Second Coming of Vahlok? Well, no. They don't know it's him, they're in no fit state of mind to even try and remember who he is or was. And also, to defeat the Dragon Priests for their masks is to assert ones power over the priests. And in the Dragon cult, **Power is Righteousness**.
