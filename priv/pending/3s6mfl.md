___

The first letter of each name of each saint (except 3) correlate to each letter of the daedric alphabet (except x and y because those are not supposed to exist). For example, Almalexia is Ayem, Sotha Sil is Seht, Vivec is Vehk, etc. I managed to fit in all the [entire pantheon](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Gods#Pantheons), the 4 bad daedra, all pilgrims, the 3 mortal gods, and the 3 ancestor gods.

I chose Ekem for Dagoth because Doht and Ekem so they should be near eachother, and Doht and Hefhed both drive foreigners out of the land

I chose Geth for Molag Bal, Hekem for Dagon, and Iya for Sheo because I could find nowhere else to put them

I chose Payem for Lorkhan cause there was nowhere else left to place him

I chose Seryn for Quam because she and Rilms' teachings are similar and should be near eachother

I chose Koht for Roris because he and Lothis' teachings are similar and should be near eachother

I chose Tayem for Azura as I think she should be near Sotha Sil.

I chose Yoodt for Malacath because Tayem reminds us of who we are, but Malacath does not, and is also associated with battle like Vehk.

I chose Web for Mephala because...well its called "web".

I chose Zyr for Veloth because I knew not where to put him
