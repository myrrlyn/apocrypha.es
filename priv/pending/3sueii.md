**History**

___
 
Alteration was created by the Ayleids in the 2nd century of the 1st Era in Southern Cyrodiil. Ayleids were the best known casters of Alteration and not a single race has matched their talent since their extinction. Alteration was created in order to resist Alessia's military strength. In the story of the Trickery of Vivec, Imperial forces tricked Vivec by sending their army under Lake Coronati and giving them water breathing, and successfully captured the city of Ald Marak. Berevar Bero once suggested that Alteration and Illusion schools should be merged together, but the request was denied. In 3E 431, Cheydinhal had become the best source of knowledge on Alteration magic.
 
Alteration is the art of changing things around you, and releases the shackles of mortal limitations, typically enhancing ones self. Alteration is limited only by your imagination.

**Spells**
 
___
 
[Jump/Jumping](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Jump) allows you to jump at great heights! To cast this spell, concentrate your magic into your feet, and form a soft cushion of magic underneath your feet as well, this will help you when you arrive back on the ground to avoid breaking your legs. The feet are difficult to concentrate magic to, so this spell will require much practice. You know you're ready when your feet begin to tingle, almost like they're asleep
 
[Levitation](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Levitate) is a difficult and dangerous spell in the school of alteration. It allows you, obviously, to levitate above the ground. Like Jump, concentrate your magic into your feet. However, unlike jump, you need to connect a strand of magic to the ground to keep you tethered. Imagine it like a piece of gum being pulled off the ground. It creates a long stretch connecting the ball of gum and the ground. Your spell is ready when you feel weightless. This spell was outlawed in 3E 421 by the empire in whats known as [The Levitation Act](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Levitation_Act).
 
[Lock](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Lock) allows you to lock doors, and is an easy spell to cast. Concentrate your magic to the tips of your fingers. You will feel your very inner bones start to vibrate slightly. The spell is now ready, and you may touch what you wish to lock
 
[Open Lock](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Open) allows you to unlock doors. It is slightly more difficult than the lock spell. Like the lock spell, concentrate your magic to your fingertips. HOWEVER, unlike Lock, you need to concentrate your magic through your fingertips first, and then around your very hand. When your hand tingles, you know the spell is ready.
 
[Paralyze](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Paralyze) allows you to force your opponent to be still and not move. This is particularly difficult because your own hands might become numb as you cast it. Concentrate your magic to your palms only and when your palms tingle, the spell is ready. Every human has their own unique magical essense, much like each human's fingerprint is unique. Match your energies with your opponents and force your magic to surround them like a blanket.
 
[Shield](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Shield) shields you from damage and is a difficult spell to cast. You must allow your magic to flow through every pore in your skin and allow the magic to coat your skin. The more pours you open, the better the shield. You'll know if you succeeded if your skin feels slippery and slidy.
 
[Slowfall](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Slowfall) allows you to fall slowly from great heights when you fall. Similar to Levitate, bind your magic from your feet to the ground. This is more difficult though because if you fall unexpectedly, you might not have enough time to cast the spell. However, if you cast it before falling, it's difficulty is lessened. You'll know the spell is successful when your feet feel heavy
 
[Swift Swim](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Swift_Swim) allows you to swim fast through water. To cast this spell, you must allow magic to exit your pours on your arms, and then you must stretch them like the fins of a fish. You may do the same on your back as well.
 
[Water Breathing](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Water_Breathing) allows you to breath underwater. To cast this spell, allow your magical energies to exit your lungs, go up your throat, and force it into the air, much like breathing a straw underwater. The larger your pool of magic, the farther you can dive.
 
[Water Walking](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Water_Walking) is by far the most difficult spell to cast in the school of alteration, if not the most difficult spell of all time. Imagine the water is a keyhole. Now since water is unstable, the keyhole continues to change. To cast your spell, you must force your magic to the soles of your feel, and let them act as the key that fits the lock. Water is ever flowing, so the shape of your magic must change with the water.
 
[Cure Paralyzation](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Cure_Paralyzation) is only to be used onto other people, not yourself. Every human has their own unique magical essense, much like each human's fingerprint is unique. To cure paralyzation, you must match your magical essense with the person who is paralyzed, and the pull it off like a blanket sheet. The spell is ready when your palms tingle.
 
[Resist Paralysis](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Resist_Paralysis) is rather difficult. You need to change the pattern of your magical aura so that your opponent cannot match it.
 
[Damage Fatique](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Damage_Fatigue) forces your opponent's stamina to lessen. To cast this spell, touch your opponent and force your magic through their body. Grip their lungs and squeeze as hard as you can. Then sever your magic and allow the hand to stick around his lungs. This will keep his air supply shorter than normal until he cures it
 
[Damage Magicka](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Damage_Magicka) forces your opponents magicka pool to be lower than normal. You must match your opponents magical energies and push your magical into their pool. The amount of magic put into the spell will be equal to the amount of magic your opponent's pool will be lessened.
 
[Resist Fire](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Resist_Fire) allows you to....resist fire spells. To cast this spell, surround your body with your magical essense, however, you'll need to make it colder than ice. So cold that no fire spell could melt it. The more cold your body can handle, the more fire the spell can resist. Nords are particularly good at this spell.
 
[Resist Frost](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Resist_Frost) allows you to resist frost spells. To cast this spell, surround your body with your magical essence, however, youll need to make it hotter than the hottest hot. So hot that no frost spell can freeze it. The more heat your body can handle, the more frost the spell can resist. Dunmer are particularly good at this spell.
 
[Resist Poison](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Resist_Poison) is VERY difficult to cast. You must imbue your magical energies into every cell of your body, and coat every blood cell with your magic. The more you of your innards you can cover, the more effective the spell.
 
[Resist Shock](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Resist_Shock) keeps your body from being electrified. To cast this spell, you must lock the static electricity in your brain to 100 Watts. You must anticipate your opponent who will attempt to add more watts to your body. You must deduce the number of watts he has cast on you until it arrives at 100 once again.
 
[Resist Magicka](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Resist_Magicka) is an mid level spell to cast. you simply surround your body with negative magicka, if you know how to cast it. Imagine adding -20 magic around your body. If your opponent brings that number to 0, your body will be affected by the spell.
 
[Feather/Fortify Carry Weight](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Feather) makes you feel lighter. Push as much of your inner gasses from your body out as much as you can to make yourself lighter.
 
[Burden](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Burden) makes your opponent heavier. Force your magic into their body and make sure it STAYS there. This will force them to be heavier.
 
[Fire Shield](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Fire_Shield), [Frost Shield](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Frost_Shield), [and Lightning Shield](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Lightning_Shield) creates a shield of fire, frost, and lightning that will damage your opponent if they touch it. Simply allow your magic to flow from your pours and make a shield around your body. For fire shield, force the magic's heat to increase, and lower for frost. For lightning, simply increase the number of watts within your magic.
 
[Telekinesis](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Telekinesis) is sometimes put into the Mysticism school, tho it fits more into Alteration. This is because Mysticism is the manipulation of magic itself, whilst alteration induces changes on the known world. Telekinesis will allow you to grab things from far away, pull, push, open, lock, etc. To cast this spell, simply link your magic to the item you wish to use (see slowfall and levitation).
 
[Detect Life](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Detect_Life) allows you to see living creatures, even through walls. Simply pour all of your magic into the cells of your eyes and then link it to your soul. You will know the spell is working when blue shapes appear.
 
[Detect Dead](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Detect_Undead) will allow you to see undead creatures, even through walls. Simply pour all of your magic into the cells of your eyes, but them quickly force 99% of the magic out of your eye. You'll know the spell is working when you see red shapes appear.
 
[Light](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Light) casts a ball of light. Simply form a ball of magic above your hand. Then heat it up, but not too hot, and then throw it into the air. It will stick to whatever surface it touches.
 
[Transmute Mineral Ore](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Transmute_Mineral_Ore) allows you to force bronze into silver, silver into gold, etc. The secret of this spell is kept secret and there is no known information on how to cast the spell.
