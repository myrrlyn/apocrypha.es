I was bored on the bus last weekend and figured you guys might get a kick or at least get a quick giggle out of something I wrote on my phone.

A good Khajiit would do well to not be curious about the goings-on of the subsurface of reality.

When a neighbour begins babbling turning the wheel on its side to get a proper look at the tower, a good Khajiit ignores him, and does not become surprised when he wakes up the next morning to find that neighbour never existed.

When Khajiit’s brother begins mumbling about the polyrhythm of celestial time, a good Khajiit weeps yet does not spend too much time thinking about his brother’s words when he wakes up the next morning to find he whispered himself to pieces in his screaming sleep.

But when Khajiit’s mother begins stabbing him with pointed spheres, a good Khajiit must ignore his caution. Good Khajiit will realize the pointed spheres do not exist and put them in the same box as the rounded cubes. Then he will close his eyes and rest for a bit while his mother tries to ignore the fact that her child never existed.
