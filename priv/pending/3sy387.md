The Dwemer were Primarily not Atheist

by Sedave Mora

Ah, the Dwemer. The most scientifically advanced race to ever walk Nirn. There are many mystery's of the Dwemer, such as their disappearance. But unfortunately there are many misconceptions as well. One of which is that they are "short". This, and the name "Dwarf" is thought to have come from the Giants, who would have perceived them as being quite small in comparison to themselves. There is another misconception about the Dwemer however, and that is that they are atheists.

Now while I will admit that atheism was present in Dwemer society probably far more than any other race, the majority of them however were not atheists. Vivec's ["The Battle of Red Mountain, and the Rise and Fall of the Tribunal"](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Battle_of_Red_Mountain) states the following:

&gt;our brethren, the Dwemer, scorned the Daedra, and mocked our foolish rituals, and preferred instead their gods of Reason and Logic.

It can be taken from this that the Dwemer indeed had some sort of pantheon consisting of gods unknown to us. Perhaps Xarxes was one of them, tho noone can say for sure. But this proves another problem. Why would an emotionless race of thinkers and logicians worship any gods? Looking at it from the Dwemeri point of view, the Aedra simply sit and watch as our world is wrought with chaos and destruction. Never do they attempt to silence wars and heal the sick, only with their most asteemed followers. None is more true than Stendarr, the god of Mercy, Charity, and Well-Earned Luck. He allows his "Vigilants of Stendarr" to go around banishing daedra and killing all who summon and/or worship them. How is it that the god of mercy's followers show no mercy? It seems even hypocrisy is among the Aedra.

And what of the Daedra? Well as most of my fellow scholars agree, Daedra are evil by our mortal standards, and none are to be trusted. Some may say "What of Azura &amp; Meridia? They seem good." This however is incorrect. Azura cursed every single Chimer in response to the actions of a few individuals, whilst Meridia's champion, Umaril the Unfeathered, was a wizard god-king who enslaved much of the Nedic people and killed thousands of people. 

So just what the Dwemer believe? Well if we infer from the notes above, we can say that they are something akin to an agnostic, but dont quite fit that definition. They knew the gods existed, Daedra and Aedra, but did not worship them, instead scorning them for their [abuse](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aedra) of the people of Nirn, for their [ego](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Azura), [deceitfulness](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Boethiah), [trickery](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Clavicus_Vile), [greed](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hermaeus_Mora), [thirst for blood](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hircine), [hypocrisy](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Jyggalag), [tainted nature](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Malacath), [destruction](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mehrunes_Dagon), [secrecy](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mephala), [slavery](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Molag_Bal), [disgust](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Namira), [thievery](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nocturnal), [sickful](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Peryite), [revelious](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sanguine), [crazy](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sheogorath), [torturous](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vaermina), and [traiterous nature](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Meridia)
