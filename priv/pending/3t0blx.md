**History**

___

Conjuration has been around for as long as men and mer have walked Nirn, however, Clan Direnni is known to be one of the first.. Conjuration allows you to summon creatures and items typically to yourself. Most creatures summoned by this school are daedra, and therefore the school of Conjuration has been shunned throughout history. Minor conjuration spells require only your magic and knowledge, but higher conjuration spells may require sigils and symbols written in strange ways (typically in a circle or pentagram) on the ground or wall, chants, incantations, and hand movements. In 3E 431, Chorrol had become the best source of knowledge on Conjuration magic.

Then, imagine yourself being in a plane of oblivion. any plane. Some prefer to imagine being in the Deadlands, as its a common realm to visit. Imagine the smells, the hot weather, the chatter of daedra, the screaming of souls. The daedra will then be banished to that realm.
