Please bare in mind borders may've been very different, and Falkreath was still part of Cyrodiil then. I've made these predictions based on the hold each priest is based in, their apparent significance in dragon history and lore (Example: Nahkriin having the most influence being the right hand man of Alduin, whilst Krosis having the least considering the apparent disregard for him, possibly for some crime or lack of recognition).

For those who cannot understand what each label is:

Vols = Volsung
 
Otar = Otar the Mad

Moro = Morokei

Hevn = Hevnoraak

Vok = Vokun

Kros = Krosis

Rahg = Rahgot

Nahk = Nahkriin

Nahkriin would have control over Modern Eastmarch and Winterhold, including the Yngol Barrow, which has the Coral Dragon Claw illustrating Snake (Snake being Shor, the Second Most Important Ancient Nordic Deity, representative of his power) Wolf (the idea of compassion (a "compassionate" leader, by dragon's accounts? Or of course, a warning that Nahkriin must stay with the pack or he will get into trouble - an attempt at control), and Moth (a confusing aspect, but plausible to believe "power is beauty" and that power is that of Nahkriin's). 

Rahgot has control of all of the Rift, which is no surprise given he managed to survive well into the 1st era against all odds, being for certain more than 139 Year's old when he was killed. This unusual aging for a Nord suggests a great amount of Magical Power. The claw in Forelhost, his monastery, presents the Fox (potential hero of man, could be argued to hero the cause of the dragon cult considering he helped them to survive after the War), Owl (no surprise for a powerful mage), and Snake (Testament to his Power as well).

He also controls the territory of Shroud Hearth Barrow. I'm sceptical of linking more than one claw to a dragon priest so I'd like to assume this what protected and kept by a minor dragon priest under his rule.

Now, with regards to the Pale, I believe it was likely a rather even split, with Vokun controlling High Gate and other Nordic cities in the North of the Pale whilst Krosis controlled Korvanjund. However, it was the action of Krosis that lead to his mask of "thievery" and losing a great deal of territory, which is why I believe he lost Korvanjund to Vokun, who stayed in his seat of power up North where he was comfortable. This explains why Krosis was buried at Shearpoint rather than Korvanjund, which incidentally was later used for King Borgas.

The Ebony Claw I will not attribute to either, for I do not know which one it truly is related to, if at all. I'd wager Vokun however, as the symbol of the Dragon is an important one, befitting a Guardian of the North and his magnificent temple.

Hevnoraak and Otar were both capable of appealing to the masses. Ragnvald is in possession of a massive city, whilst Hevnoraak possesses more spread out temples, leading me to believe he controlled more, but smaller territories stretching into Whiterun. Hevnoraak's claw, of Dragon, Hawk, and Wolf, represents this theorised power, the brutality (his name) of nature in the Hawk, and once again the humbling Wolf for earlier discussed reasons, and the savage nature of his brutality.

Otar's potential claw is the Emerald, of Bear, Whale, and Snake. Being known as a benevolent leader in the past justifies the bear (precursor to the God of justice Stendarr), the Whale representing Stuhn connotating guarding (guarding  from the Reach?), and the Snake, once again, of his power.

The Claw in Bleak Fall's has no easily known order, it could be any of the provinces, given that they all border Whiterun one way or another. Also possible that Whiterun was one or both of the Dragon Priests that went to Solstheim. My best guess is Morokei or Nahkriin. 

The only Dragon Priest in Hjaalmarch is Morokei, so I would presume, given that he was buried in the Capital, Bromjunaar, the capital and a lot of the surrounding areas would be under the power of Glorious Morokei. I would attribute him to the Wolf, Hawk, and Wolf. Wolf twice to illustrate Morokei controlling the united grounds of the Dragon Cult, and Hawk representing the unstoppable powers of nature.

Despite my drawings, I believe Folgunthur would fall to the rule of Volsung in Haafingar. The Ivory Dragon, thus, belongs to him. Hawk, Hawk, Dragon. A lot of Haafingar is wild and mountainous, suggesting Nature and the Dragon's influence over the world (Dragons and Mountains, they get along well).

Thus concludes my rough theorising of the territories of each Main Dragon Priest of the Cult. Any feedback? :)
