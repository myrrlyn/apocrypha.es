**History**
 
___
 
Destruction is possibly the oldest school of magick. As the name implies, spells in this school are meant to damage, injure, kill, and all matters of harm. There are many spells in this school, and the greatest of destruction masters are said to be able to raze a single city within a single hour. It should also be known that there are spells that inflict sun damage upon opponents, tho some place such spells in the school of restoration. Berevar Bero once proposed moving all destruction spells into the school of alteration, but his request was denied. In 3E 431, Skingrad had become the best source of knowledge on Destruction magic. Dunmer are particularly talented in Destruction magic.
