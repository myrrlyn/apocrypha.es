**History**
 
___
 
It is unknown when illusion magic was created nor who created it, but the most famous user of illusion was Jagar Tharn when he tricked the world into thinking he was Uriel Septim VII until he was killed by an unknown hero. Illusion is similar to alteration, in that they both cause change, but alteration is bound to the laws of nature. Illusion is not. Illusion also typically affects the mind, and is popular among thieves. In 3E 431, Bravil had become the best source of knowledge on Illusion magic.
