**History**

___

Restoration has been around for as long as war has existed, and so we may trace it back to the War of the Ehlnofey. However, restoration did not find an increase of usage until sometime after the late 2nd Era. The most famous healers include Saint Meris the Peaceful, and Saint Seryn the Merciful. Restoration is used to repair wounds, heal disease, increase skills and attributes, and repel undead. In 3E 431, Anvil had become the best source of knowledge on Restoration magic.

**Spells**

___

[Fortify Attack](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Fortify_Attack), [Restore Attribute](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Restore_Attribute), [Restore Skill](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Restore_Skill), [Fortify Skill](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Fortify_Skill), and [Fortify Attribute](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Fortify_Attribute) both require enhancing various chemicals in the brain to increase your knowledge on said subjects. Please refer to "Fortification for Dummies" by Grolah Gro-Rolag.

[Fortify Fatigue](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Fortify_Fatigue) increases your fatigue so you get tired out not as quickly. Simply pour your magic into your lunks to increase the amount of oxygen they can inhale.

[Fortify Health](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Fortify_Health) expands your life span. It is unknown how to cast this spell as few have mastered it.

[Fortify Magicka](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Fortify_Magicka) increases your magicka pool. Simply remain calm. This may require meditation outside, and you must allow as much magick from Aetherius from the Stars and Sun to absorb into you as possible.

[Resist Common Disease](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Cure_Common_Disease) does as it sounds. Imbue your magic into every cell and replace all dead cells or old cells with new ones.

[Cure Poison](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Cure_Poison) removes all toxins from the body. Imbue your magic into every cell, grab hold of the poison, and pull it out of your pours, OR, if you master it enough, you may be able to transform the poison into harmless proteins.

[Turn Undead](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Turn_Undead) is controversial, as it makes undead unwilling to fight. Some have suggested it be placed in the school of conjuration, others say illusion. Either way, the casting method is the same. Force your magick into the opponent and force the amygdala to fire off non stop.

[Ward](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ward) creates a shield that blocks all incoming magical and physical attacks. Simply let magic pour out of your palms and fingertips, and let it take the form of a shield. The thicker the magic, the better.
