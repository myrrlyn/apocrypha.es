[Calcelmo and Gandil:Dwemer Research]

 5th of Sun's Dawn 4E 203

Dear Calcelmo,

It has come to my attention that you are studying the lost race of Mer called Dwemer.Various travellers who have passed by my laboratory have noted that you have samples of Dwemer metals you would like tested and researched.I would like the opportunity to work with such crafts in my laboratory,but things have been hectic with the Thalmor constantly ordering fine made equipment for war preparations.That blasted Elenwen,so cursed be her name, nearly ran us to ruin with the useless ordering of weaponry only to be wasted in that nightmare called Skyrim.I will send you a letter of acknowledgement when the shipment arrives.Please send your samples by ship to:

3198 Sunbird St.
Firsthold
Summerset Isle

Sincerely,
High Aldmeri Crafter Gandil

Dear Calcelmo,

Today your samples arrived and I could not be more thrilled!You managed to get a load this large to here and I thank you.If I may recall it was a load of:10 Dwemer cogs,5 gears,20 small levers,and 3 large solid pieces.[Note:I have noticed that the motifs on the samples have a slightly different design than specimens from Vvardenfell.Will look at this later.]For now I shall begin my research with a machine called a Aetherium Fusion Refractor.Tis' a wondrous little tool that should cut my cost and time in half.Well I will let you know what I find in my next letter.

Sincerely,
High Aldmeri Crafter Gandil

Dear Calcelmo,

It is will great pleasure to tell you that last few months have been impressive.I took your samples and started with a large solid piece for less materiel losses in the procedure.I started by using a spell to pull out the properties from the metal itself,which wasn't hard.Even Dwemer crafts can't stand the might of Aldmeri spell weaving.Although some think Dwemer metal to be actually brass,I beg to differ.The base metals seem to be Corundum with additives of Iron,Titanium,Chromium,and Vanadium.Corundum is extremely hard,but not as diamond or Dragonbone.The other base metal seems to be Ebony[You can see flecks of darker material on the ingots.] with additive of Silica[Note:Corundum and Silica have fairly high melting points.]which indicates that the Dwemer were reaching for a hard non-corrosive metal to withstand the wear of time and weather.Another thing about Corundum is it's less like a metal and more like a jewel,think Rubies or Emeralds.So you wouldn't have corrosive metal.The Ebony base metal is interesting because of the Lorkhan stories and how it is his blood perhaps.Why did the Dwemer choose god blood for metal?Well the Ebony has a high Silica content which you can find in sand,but also living beings.My test have shown that Silica is very conductive and may allow magicka to flow more easily through it.Well i'm off to do more tests.


Sincerely,
High Aldmeri Crafter Gandil

Dear Calcelmo,

I am in absolute shock.One day last month while doing test on the samples,I happened to drop my Magus Probe accidently and it struck the cog I was working on.When it struck the cog a faint warm glow enveloped the room.By Auri-el iv'e never seen such a thing.It was like a warm afternoon with children laughing,and lutes playing softly.Was this a Dwemer memory?It was wondrous.Reclaiming my Magus Probe I continued my work while enjoying the glow.I tapped the cog three more times to get the correct reading,but then all hell broke loose.The glow turned dark,I could hear people screaming and felt sorrow at this nightmare.But I still remember that SOUND!I was like a hammer hitting Nirn with a loud RINNNNNNNNG!!!

And then I realised that this metal was bound with souls.Souls of Dwemer.How horrible a thing to do to your fellow kin.

I think I shall retire a while until I make sense of this whole thing.

Sincerely,
High Aldmeri Crafter Gandil

5:00AM Gandil gets out of bed and makes himself tea.

6:00AM Gandil starts writing Calcelmo,but he crumbles the paper and leans back in his chair sighing.

7:00AM SLAM! SLAM! "open up Gandil,we know you're in there!"says a Thalmor Soldier.Silence...,SLAM! The soldier blasts the door away from it's hinges with a firebolt spell and they rush into the laboratory.

7:10AM "These metal samples now belong to the Thalmor High Research Ministry!"says a Thalmor Justiciar.

"No,don't touch them!"shouts Gandil as he leaps up from his seat.

As Gandil tried to protect the metal samples,an Aldmeri blade stabbed through his chest from behind,killing him there on the spot.

"Fool,you can keep nothing from us!"the soldier shouts.

"We now have what we were looking for all these years."said a justicar.
