Enchanting is the art of imbuing magic into an item, be it weapon, armor, or jewelry. To Enchant an item, first you must perform the spell you want to use (see all previous volumes of this series), however, you must also imbue a piece of your own magical essense into it. Do not worry, your life span will not decrease from this, as your essense does replenish itself. The best enchantment is a spell that increases your enchanting skills.

[Necromancy](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Necromancy) has always been highly speculative. The very thought of the art of tampering with the soul is enough to make an entire bar go quiet. But as we all know, Necromancy isn't always unpopular with people, and in certain places it has even been encouraged! The ancient Dragon Cult is known to have practiced necromancy, even going as far as to having a Dragon Priest's followers buried around him and using necromantic rituals to serve and protect his ancient undead body, and the climate of Skyrim makes it far easier for bodies to stay in tact, making it a popular location for necromancy. Today, Necromancy in skyrim is not illegal, but highly looked down upon, and those who practice it within the College of Winterhold are told to keep their necromantic practices out of the eye of the public. It is commonly thought that the Dunmer practice and encourage necromancy, but this could not be farther from the truth. The Dunmer find the art of necromancy to be sacriligious, and what they practice is not necromancy, but instead worship of their ancestors. However, necromancy is not particularly illegal. The Telvanni are known for being necromancers, but still even the reclusive Telvanni refuse to practice necromancy on the body or soul of a fellow Dunmer, instead perfering that of a Khajiit or Argonian.

And although every province of Tamriel views necromancy as abhorrent, there is one location where it is highly encouraged, practiced, and viewed as an everyday part of life. The Sload of Thras are the best known for their necromancy, having said that even a youngling can raise the body of a Dreugh. It is unknown if the Sload are willing to practice necromancy on their own kind however.

The most well known necromancers include: Mannimarco the King of Worms, Lorgren Benirus, and Vastarie. Due to the way necromancy is viewed, this writer will not write about how to raise the dead.

[Shadow Magic](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shadow_Magic) is the art of manipulating shadows, and was first discovered by Azra Nightwielder. Shadow Magic allows you to pull exact copies of yourself from an alternate world, as shadows are not the absense of light, but rather the reflection of other worlds. Using this form of magic, you can manipulate anything that casts a shadow.

Shadow Magic is, in essense, one of the most difficult forms of magic one can perform. Rumour has it that to perform shadow magic, you must perform hours of meditation to gain a calm mind, a mind that cannot be distracted. Let all known possibilities flow into your mind. Pull on the shadow, you will feel its presence when your body goes cold. The most well known wielders of Shadow Magic are Azra Nightwielder, Pergan Asuul, Skelos Undriel.

Tonal Architecture is an art created and used commonly by the Dwemer. Some say it is the manipulation of music, tunes, wavelengths, manipulation of vibrations, or even plucking the strings of Nirn itself. In order to use Tonal Architecture, you must have tools that can perform it. The only known tools are Keening and Sunder, whilst wearing a gauntlet named Wraithguard. Nothing is known of where these tools currently exist, save the rumour that Keening has found it's way in Skyrim. It is thought that the Thu'um is a minor form of the art of Tonal Architecture, though this would imply that the average dwemer could easily surpass the toughest of Thu'um wielders. Notable Tonal Architect's include Kagrenac, Yagrum Bagarn, and Bthuand Mzahnch.

[The Thu'um](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Thu%27um) is a form of magic that utilizes a person's voice to create various effects such as pushing enemies away, breathing fire, and other various effects. The only known practicers of Thu'um have been Nords and Atmorans, minus Tiber Septim possibly being a Breton. In order to use the Thu'um, you must know the words of power that are associated with various effects. For example, the word "Yol" can produce a minor spark, whilst "Yol Toor" can produce a descent flame, and finally "Yol Toor Shul" produces a massive flame. Performing the Thu'um, like performing shadow magic, requires intense meditation throughout a single lifetime, and most people may only be able to learn 2 or 3 shouts. Dragonborn however, one who is born with the soul of a dragon, are able to naturally learn the Thu'um quickly and learn many words of power within a single month. 

Notable wielders of the Thu'um include: Derek the Tall, Jorg Helmbolg, King Hoag Merkiller, Miraak the Traitor, Jurgen Windcaller, Arngeir, Tiber Septim, and Dragons.
