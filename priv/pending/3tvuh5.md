Dragonrend is the first shout created by man and it's the first that is *intrinsically human*. It's a shout that uses words which represent concepts entirely foreign to the dragons. The words of the dragon language, in a thu'um is not just speaking, but understanding, feeling, expressing that word's meaning. The dragons understand their own language because it is intrinsically part of who they are, their very souls. that's why their names are shouts which can call them, why they hold such power. because they are the verbal essence of what and who they are. 
     This is why Dragonrend is so damned important. That mortals first shout would be the words that Man understands better than any living thing before it. Words integral and at the very core of the very nature of mankind. The God of Man, is a reincarnation of the god of mortality. One who continues to come back, always tied to humanity over and over again. Shezzar, Lorkhan, Talos is the very pillar by which humanity is tethered to mundus,Talos IS the tower, Lorkhan IS the tower of humanity. And He is a god of Mortality, of being temporary, of dying. 

Dragons, being immortal cannot comprehend death, something being temporary, finite, not like humans can, and the very essence of human, the one thing every human has in common with each other and understands is that life is temporary, life is finite, The immutable truth of the universe is Man is Mortal.  

Of course, the weapon Man would use to destroy immortal time dragons would be the very essence, the personification of it's greatest weakness, the very crux of it's entire existence and the core of what defines humanity would be forcing it to suffer the psychological trauma of what every single human being feels from the moment they're born until the day they die. What it takes to destroy the destroyer of the universe, and the devourer of time itself is nothing less than pure, *Weaponized Existential Dread*
And every single human being, every man has that as a part of it's soul, to the point that it was the very first thing humans created from a language of expressing meaning upon reality, formed from complete understanding of it. 

And that, my friends, is why Humanity dominated tamriel. That is why the human's soul is black. Because at the heart of every human being, in every one of our souls, is the very essence of terror and when you show that to a being who's very essence is devouring and destruction, it breaks them.  But 'ol charlie? Well he just takes a drink and keeps right on back to work in the morning.
