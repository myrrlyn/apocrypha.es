Long long ago in northern Vvardenfell, there lived a Dwemer, Mzuleft. He was a kind and gentle soul, and had never harmed a single living being. One day, his brother came to greet him. 

"Hello" said said Mzuleft. "How is my dearest brother?"

Mzuleft's brother was excstatic, but was scared to speak, for he had discovered a great secret. 

"I have found something great" Nchardahrk said. "Knowledge beyond mortal comprehension" he smiled, sliding a book from under his robe.

It was worn, torn, and had dirt and smudges all over the remnants of the shining white cover with "Oht" sprawled upon the front.

Mzuleft gasped as he saw what his brother had found. "Where had you found this treacherous artifact?" he asked.

"T'was laying in the ocean to the north" he had said. "It is the book of the **Man of Ambition**, is it not?" he smiled harshly.

Mzuleft had not a moment to say a word before his brother opened the book. He looked at the pages and smiled as he found a particular sprawl of writing, written in the language of the Golden invaders. His brother chanted the words, strange and long, for Mzuleft did not understand them.

At that very moment, the foot of a god smashed through Mzuleft's little shack, and killed his brother. Mzuleft cried in fear and shame for his brother, for now he knew his brother's secret as a worshipper of the **Man of Ambition**.

Red flames dotted the land until a great sorcerer arrived. Sorkvild was his name, a man from the northern mountains far away to study his people. Sorkvild battled the flames of the **Man of Ambition** until the great Sorkvild struck the **Man of Ambition's** with the white book. The god fell to one knee and smiled down at the great wizard. As he kneeled, he crushed Mzuleft as well. "The kind Dwemer is dead, as is all those important to him, and the curse is lifted" the **Man of Ambition** said. "But now I must leave this battle, ashamed and beaten, as I have fallen to one knee." With those last words, the **Man of Ambition** disappeared into red ash and smoke, back to his land of treachery.

And that is the story of how Dagon Fel.

Edit: I remembered the Molag Bal's name means fire stone, not Dagon's, so I changed the name **Stone of Fire** to **Man of Ambition**
