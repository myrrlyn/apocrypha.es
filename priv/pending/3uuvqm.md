[**First recorded entry**](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/3um3ef/diaries_of_the_royal_bard_1st_recorded_entry/)

*Pelin-El, we call him, and he was sent by the gods*

*The Star-Made Knight we call him, and his surcoat was bloody with the blood of our foes*

*Pelinal the Bloody we call him, and on his first night here,*

*He killed thirty*

Where he came from, what his true name is, why he is wearing clothes made of strange stone, these are all questions that I, nor anyone I know, can answer. What I *do* know, is that my doubts have been removed. I doubted our queen’s visions. I have always been a man of doubt. But, when I saw him ascending the Golden Hill, covered in Ayleid blood, I knew. I knew our queen was right. I knew our cause was right, for why else would the gods help us. 

I stupidly wrote that I was unsure how one man could make a difference, but already this Pelin-El has captured five strongholds for our cause, slaying hundreds in the process. Morihaus must be jealous, for the people are calling him the champion of our queen. Or maybe I am stupid, and expect a man as godly as him to fall for such emotions as mere men do. What I know for sure, is that he greeted the knight with excited stomping and bellowing, and the two have had many conversations already.

I stand amongst these heroes; Al-Esh, Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne, and Pelin-El. All stand taller than me, and all behave like et’Ada, where I behave as the mere man I am. They all are warriors, great inspirations and great leaders, and I am just a singer who was lucky enough to befriend a queen.

*My glory is bestowed upon another*

*Worthier being, and I feel good*

*I am no hero, only a bard*

*And what are gods, when none worships them?*
