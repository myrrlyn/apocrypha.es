Dear Sir. Divayth Fyr,

It has come to my mind many times why those of the Tribunal Temple would worship Daedra, as they have caused nothing but harm among our people. But then I remember there are so many who continue to preach the word of Azura, that she is truly the most "good" daedra among them, that she cares about her followers, that she wants nothing more than to keep her followers safe and happy. 

Based on my rather limited knowledge of Azura, I would ask that you observe my thoughts and report back to me regarding this subject.

Azura is one of the most dangerous daedra you could possibly involve yourself in. Whilst princes such as Mehrunes Dagon or Molag Bal, they are undoubtedly evil, and yet they are so predictable. You know if they what they want, and they are rather up front and honest about it. 

Azura however is a snake. We know not what she desire, what she wishes for, or what her goals are. She is a snake, the serpent in the sky who grins over our foolishness. It has come to my attention from an associate of mine that [The people of the Iliac Bay region believe that Azura bewitches some of her followers to become her "lovers" and "virtual slaves".](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Azura). If this proves to be true, then it would indicate that not only does Azura trick people into becoming her follower, but if she doesnt bewitch them, then her followers have some sort of Stockholm Syndrome.

Who was it that changed our beautiful golden skin dark and our wonderous eyes red just for the actions of a few individuals? Who was it that sat and watched as our people suffered during The Red Year? Who was it that sat and waited for literally thousands of years before sending an incarnate of Nerevar to kill Voryn Dagoth? Azura, that is who. 

Knowledge, Dreams, Destruction, Slavery, there are many princes dedicated to many aspects of our world. But what exactly does Dusk and Dawn indicate? That she rules over everything from 4am-6am and 4pm-6pm??? No, her sphere resembles that of Azura herself. Lies and trickery. Dusk and Dawn are two polar opposites of eachother, and when one exists, the other does not. This shows Azura's true nature, a god of polar opposites, she is what seems to represent Multiple Personality Disorder, or perhaps even Bipolar Disorder. She acts as if she is a kind and gentle soul, but has shown she is full of nothing but ego and vanity.

What are your thoughts Sir. Divayth Fyr? You were the only one I could write to, as the other Masters of House Telvanni tend to be at least slightly religious, and would perhaps have me slain, but you and I are not particularly religious.

Your Student,

Sedave Mora
