*(Author’s note: the following is a Cyrodiilic variation of the creation myth dating back to at least the mid-First Era, with oral origins speculated to be much older. The tale is unique for giving the Divine Julianos a central role, as well as being the only known creation myth in which the Lorkhan-figure chooses to separate from his heart, yet does not do so on his own. The tale is a fairly common one in Nibenay, where Julianos is especially revered among the magocratic ruling elite.)*    


 ...for Shezzar’s song had captivated the Gods, filling them with the wonder and joy of creation. But Shezzar’s song had been a half-truth, for though he had sung of the pain of world-bearing, he had not sung of the sacrifices. Children take everything from their parents, and no matter how much of themselves they poured into it, Nirn screamed and screamed for more. Swathes of spirits had given themselves completely to it, and though the plane(t) grew, it remained unsubstantial. Magnus, thinking his designs failures, fled from creation, and many of the Gods followed him.
    
Akatosh Himself was stretching his wings to flee when Julianos, Apprentice to the Architect, chastised him and all who would follow for their doubts (this is why the ancient tales of the Aldmer never mention him). For Julianos was wise, wisest of all the Gods who had remained, and he could already see growings signs of the majesty Shezzar had described. His many siblings who had given themselves entirely to the world were changing; some fading into stone infused with life-giving energies, others transforming into trees and grasses and flowers that would recreate themselves a million times over. Of these things and others he spoke, not with song, but with rhetoric, addressing each of them in turn. Finally all were persuaded to remain, and each in turn gave themselves unto the new world they sought to build together.    

When all that they had given was still not enough to crystallize creation, Julianos took up Magnus’ designs and determined to find a way to complete their world. As he studied the geometry of existence, he determined that in order for a world to eventuate, ossify, and propagate souls, a powerful spiritual nexus was required; in other words, Nirn needed a Heart. He called his findings the Damned Equation, which he shared with his Siblings sorrowfully. All now looked to Shezzar, for he was their leader, and had been the most adamant of them from the start.  
  
Swayed by Julianos’ logic, he agreed to the exsanguination. But he could not perform the surgery himself, so Julianos instructed Akatosh on how to remove the Heart and transplant it safely into the stone of the world. So precise was the surgery that Shezzar lived on, despite being slightly diminished, as a powerful spirit, even without his Heart. When this was done the world was finally made whole, and the remaining gods, now diminished themselves, went their separate ways for the first time since long before time began. Most were devastated at their loss of majesty and might, and traveled southward to build a civilization based on the aetherial splendor of their past. But Julianos was wise, and foresight told him that this was a world made for new things. And so he traveled north, with the followers of Shezzar, to build a new kind of civilization for his chosen people.
