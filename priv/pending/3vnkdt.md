Most have heard of the legerdary *Oghma Infinium*, or the Black Books of  Apocrypha. Less well known is the [Fragmentae Abyssum Hermaeus Morus](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Fragmentae_Abyssum_Hermaeus_Morus), a book of equal importance to the texts mentioned above, yet far less known. The reason for this is that this book is not Daedric in origin, but was instead written by multiple different peoples during different times in history.

**The Fox and the Hare**
The first story is written in some form of Nedic and was written by the early Atmoran settlers in Tamriel. It details how the Fox Shor saves the great Ysgramor from being turned into Elvenkind by the Hare, Herma-Mora. This shows us that even the early humans of Tamriel had both a deep respect and fear for the schemes of the Woodland Man. This story is almost certainly false, but the Forest God does not care if knowlege is correct.

**Treaty of Apocrypha**
The second story is one of Apocrypha itself and is written in a mix of Ayleidoon and Ehlnofex, but uses Ehlnofex grammatical rules. This was likely written by the early Ayleid "Hyrma Mora" cults of High Rock. It tells us How Hyrma Mora struck a treaty with with the Void before time itself to create a realm to hoard all knowledge and keep it forever hidden and cused there. This realm was Apocrypha.

**Hermaeus Mora, Abyssal Cephaliarch**
This text is written in common Cyrodiilic. The chant is common among the Primeval Seekers of Northeastern High Rock. The text itself is fairly literal and is spoken whenever one wants to summon the Gardener of Men.

**AE HERMA MORA**
The Scarab, Scarab AE, Hyrma Mora! AE AH PADHOME LKHAN PADO AI. PADO AH PSJJJJ AE LKHAN.

*The rest of the book is covered in scribblings that appear to represent  Eyes and Tentacles.*
