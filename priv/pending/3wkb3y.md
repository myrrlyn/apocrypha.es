Titus, my beloved cousin, I'm writing this letter to let you know about my latest work. Ispired by the brave deeds of Uriel V, it's about Akavir and the -sadly- failed expedition of this emperor of old. As I'm predicting, you would ask how did I represent the Akavir, well I did some research; books, fighter guild's arquives, I even tried to find some veterans (which I couldn't). But anyway, their armour was inspired by some of the Blades desings (I took myself to cloud Ruler temple!) and I tried to use, symbolically, snakes, to represent their vile nature. So, as you know, I'm trying to get my new masterpiece to the emperor's atention, And I hope you could help me in this task with your position in the court. You see, my fame runs just locally here in daggerfall, but I'm aiming at the imperial city, the court, you know... I'm already tired of those local lords, which richness, taste and glamour one cannot compare to the IC. So, I'm sending you a copy of the painting, wich, by the way, is an offence to the original. You see, I paid this "master" mage of my local mages guild, which "has the best alteration and conjuration skills" of the chapter and he made this. Whatever, the original with the gourgeos colours and  incredible oils -magical I would say- that this argonian alquemist supplied me, you'll have to imagine, but you'll get the idea anyway. Hope you can help me.

ps: And sorry for my bad writing (growing up in that countryside full of orcs didn't help).
