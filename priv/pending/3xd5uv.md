The most noble Imperial race prides itself on multiculturalism and foreign implementation into their glorious Cyrodiilic Society. As such, it is no surprise that Imperial families all over the great province based in the very heart of Tamriel.

It is in the Colovian settlements to the west and North that one can see great pride for Nordic ancestry. Indeed, most if not all families originating from that region initially sprung from Nordic settlers. However, for whose who can claim several or recent generations of Nordic and Imperial ancestry, it is looked upon as a sign of honour and prestige in their society. The aristocracies of the land often aim to highlight such an important aspect of their ancestries. After all, which race could be argued to hold honour and glory in such high regard against all others, but the Nords? Important though they may be in Colovia, Nibenese families would look down on interbreeding with hardier, but less civilised and intelligent clans of the Northern lands. 

Despite cultural differences, the Redguards of Hammerfell did appear to hold similar values in their society, resulting in a respectful viewpoint by the Colovian peoples, but by no means in any regard that one could compare to the Nordic peoples. However, recent political perspectives on the Empire have threatened this relationship of respect in the Western Lands.

The Colovian people, do not hold in Elven races in any high esteem whatsoever. Generally speaking, opposition to the magic of Mer and millennia of conflicts over the Years. Understandably so, this is particularly prevalent in the treatment of the Dunmeri people, of whom descendence is both an extremely rare occurrence and frowned upon in society. Similar but lesser distain is held for the other Elven Races. Views of Bretons vary considerably - often depending upon individual towns and cities in the lands. They do generally receive a neutral-positive reception from the people.

Nibenese culture is primarily focused on maintaining certain elven ideologies, styles, and traditions. Elven ancestry is, though common, something which many would hold in extremely high regard. An appreciation for Long, Healthy, Luxurious lives and the magic elves possess have lead such families to be the envies of all others. In the aristocracy of Nibenese Lands, most if not all of the families are from Elven origins, and one or two even claim to be completely pure Merish people. To stem from mer is status unrivalled. 

And yet, in recent years, the political situations of the times have had a profound effect on the Region. Escaping members of Great Houses have re-established old connections to the more influential families of the region, integrating perfectly into these bloodlines. Indeed, the cities and towns bordering the Morrowind have very often been cared for by Dunmeri-Imperial families. It is no shame, but a position of interest and respect. Dunmeri blood flowed through septim veins, who would argue against its purity?

Profound too is the effect of the conflict of the Great War. It was following and shortly preceding this conflict that supporters of the Aldmeri Dominion, both Bosmer and Altmer, married and bred into their Imperial elven descended sympathisers. As such, Altmer and Bosmer asserting themselves into these families have gained much influence and power in the Imperial System. For the few who have accepted them, to be from Altmer is still a sign of purity and power as it once was viewed before the conflicts of the time emerged. For the others, those who would once bost of Altmeri lineage or envy those of such ancestry have adapted to the current situations, refusing to disrespect or join with their "Allies" from Alinor. However, Elven blood is still representative of power, magic, intelligence, and a long life. To forget these qualities in the face of politics would be to kill long standing ideologies lasting throughout the history of Cyrodiil, ideologies that would not die so easily.

Thus, it is the Bretons who are now seen so positively in Imperial Society. They are the last allies truly united with the Empire, connected not by land but by faith and similar philosophies. To be a Breton in Cyrodiil is twice what it once was, for now they are held in high regard for their loyalty. And of course, Bretons also maintain the connection of Elven Values in Civilisation, allowing the truly magnificent Nibenese Culture to survive through political turmoil threatening to destroy everything they are.

In summary, both Colovian and Nibenese regions are multicultural, preferring to connect themselves to those of similar ideologies in the West and maintaining old relationships of applicable power in the East respectively. Political situations of the recent years have provided a threat to the enduring societies both peoples possess. Despite this, it is evident that the civilisations both have worked together to create continue to function in harmony, and will do so as long as the Empire serves as their point of unity in our world.
