*[Captain’s Log]*   
*[Void Date: 3.353.9.7-21]*     
*[Dreamsleeve Frequency: WG-2 Collective Memospore]*    


This is the log of Captain Kathryn Janae, Commanding Battlemage of the Royal *N.V.N. Wayfinder*.    

Our mission: to chart a course through the Outer Mundus to the Plane(t) Arkay, with the goal of investigating the aetheric anomaly orbiting the Plane(t), known currently as the Black Moon.    

Lift-off from the Primundus via White-Gold was achieved at the 20th hour, and all systems continue to operate at peak efficiency. Manaknights are running continuous scans for fluctuating Daedron levels, and Belief Officers have been posted in meditation on all decks to maintain ship-wide nilgularity. Chief Belief Officer Motierre reports that it will take approximately 12 Mundays to reach the beginning of the Outer Mundus.     

Travel to the Outer Mundus is rarely attempted, and was banned under Imperial Law following the event known as the [Haunting of the *N.V.N. Voyager*](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/3v7hf7/is_it_possible_that_there_life_on_other_planets/). However, His Majesty Emperor Pelagius IV saw fit to lift this ban in 3E 352 following disturbing reports of Outer-Mundal activity from the mananauts of the Void-Yard Epsilon.     

Our mission is unique in the history of the New Void Navy. Fortress-class vessels are unfit for reconnaissance, which is why the Immaterial Harmonics Institute of Incongruitech and Extrinsic Travel was commissioned to genengineer a smaller, faster, and more magicka-efficient megalomoth. The result was the *Wayfinder*, the first galley-class void-vessel of its kind, equipped with triple-efficient welkynd mana-sails based on Ayleid kalaedomantics, advanced shrouding capabilities based on newly-invented darkling-mana-conversion, the latest in **ASSN** emergency warp-tek, and full arrays of multi-dimensional math-cannons.    
Our crew of 50 is the smallest in N.V.N. history, and includes squads of Belief Officers, Transliminists, Manaknights, and Genengineers, all selected personally by the Imperial Battlemage. Due to the extended nature of our mission, a new officer has been added to the ranks: the Chief Chroniculist. I’m not entirely versed in Chronocule-Collection theory, but his tek should enable accurate timekeeping while at-Void, which would be invaluable in avoiding planar displacement syndrome, especially on long-term missions.    

Tomorrow, all crew-members will begin standard regimens of advanced alteration algorithms, to ensure that everyone is prepared to maintain their own oxygen while at-Void. We have less than two weeks to prepare ourselves - for anything. Rumors regarding the Black Moon conflict wildly, and next to nothing is known for certain, except that something of aetheric proportions is out there. Something not recorded on any orrery known to man or mer. Until we know more, *Wayfinder* will only log one daily progress report, as we continue to prepare for planefall. Julianos walk with us all, councilors.    

Janae out.
