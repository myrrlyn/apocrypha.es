I am hesitant to write this letter to you, but I feel that it has become nessesary to write it now - for tomorrow it might be too late. As you know the Alik'r has fallen into Political turmoil after your father-, King Fahara'Jad, 's death. I have taken on the role as King, and I see no other  way to stop this madness other than the Alik'r resigning from the Daggerfall Covenant. My advisor Marelo at-Ryan has for a long time bothered me with this matter and I have found that it is time to listen to his advise.

I suggest a meeting between the Kings (and Queens) of Daggerfall, Shornhelm, Evermore, Wayrest, Orsinium and Sentinel to be arranged at an approprate location of your choosing. There the options for such a resignation could be discussed. I regret that we have come to this situation but I have hopes that you understand that I would not do this if I did not think it was the best option for the Redguard people. I also understand that you may see me, a Crown King, as an enemy but I assure you that that is one thing I am not.

I shall await your answer which I hope will be presented to me soon.

-King Haed√≠n at-Bergama, 2E 603
