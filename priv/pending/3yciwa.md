*This fragment of unpublished propaganda was recovered, along with many documents and other pieces of unpublished or unfinished propaganda containing information and rumours as preposterous as follows, from one of the Mythic Dawn hideouts spread across Cyrodiil, soon after the ending of the Oblivion Crisis, reader discretion is advised.*

Do not be fooled by the imposters! Those who sit upon the Ruby Throne are but masked usurpers, trying to bring Tamriel to ruin! Be warned! And know that the Mythic Dawn rises to save Tamriel from certain doom.

Many have seen how erratic the Emperor has become after the so-called “Simulacrum”, and many have expressed their concerns about the heirs, or, in better words, the doppelgangers put in their place by Jagar Tharn, although they do not realize the extent of the of these concerns, and the Imperial authorities claim lies, all of it. And I must say, they speak the truth. At least partially.

The heirs are indeed doppelgangers, but not put by the Battlemage, instead, by their own father, who is but another farce all the same. My dear reader, the truth, which I shall present you, may be hard to understand, or even to believe, but it is the truth nonetheless! Pay heed and know that the solution lies inside the reach of your fingertips.

Uriel VII, along with all his heirs and relatives, are Tiger-Folk of Akavir! Wearing the skins of our rulers, but under the thin cover lies a stripped skin. Jagar Tharn was but one of the many pawns of the Ka Po’ Tun plan, an agent set to make all preparations for the coming of the Tiger-Folk to take the place of the Emperor, and the famous Eternal Champion? Another of their pawns, for a rather very well-fabricated plan, I must say, for it managed to fool almost the entire population of the Empire! *Almost*!

The truth has been right under your noses for so long, and yet none of you ever noticed it! *Mysterious Akavir* laid it all before your eyes, and yet you did not see the truth! You thought the Tiger-Folk of Po’ Tun tried to become the Dragons of legend, those of ancient Nordic bedtime stories? No! The Dragons they eventually became were our Dragons! The Imperial Dragons! The Dragonborn Emperors! And they needed less than one hundred years to do so. They captured the Emperor and his soldiers, and made slaves of them, only to extract their essence, so they could take their skins and bodies and forms and thoughts and seize the Imperial rule of Tamriel without raising alarm, so they could become the rulers of the Empire.

As soon as they learned to be Dragonborn, they set their sights upon Tamriel. And with incredible cunning, they took the Ruby Throne and the center of all Tamrielic power. And soon our eastern shores will be daily harassed by the continuous invasion of the Tiger-Folk if the people of Tamriel don’t realize the truth, and those who have seen the truth gather and plan the day we will free Tamriel of this threat!

The Mythic Dawn sees the truth, and we will bring liberty and revolution to Tamriel, we will take down the imposters and prevent the Akaviri threat! If you have seen the lies of the so-called Emperor and also want to see Tamriel free of this eastern menace, then seek us, and if you are worthy, you shall find. Join our ranks and prepare to usher Tamriel into a new era of prosperity, truth and freedom!
