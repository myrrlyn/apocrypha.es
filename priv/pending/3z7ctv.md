*This is an old lullaby sung by Hyamir, an old refugee, when he herded his guars as a youngling in Eton Nir. I have done my best to translate as faithfully as can be done without breaking the meter.  - Aggapius Tucca, Sentinel 4E 178*


Blue-eye, Blue-eye, little Guar,

Please my Friend don’t go too far.


(The) Harpy with her ugly beak,

could, perhaps, upon you sneak.


Your old mother home came late,

I worry you’re with the Eight.


Blue-eye, Blue-eye, where are you?

If you die then I’ll die too.


Oh my star, you cry in need,

Soon you shall the Harpies feed.


Don’t yet to the Skies ascend,
please my Guar don’t leave your Friend.
