*Behold Tu’whacca, welcoming to the Far Shores a particularly stoic Ansei. One of the last to perish in the final maneuver of the lost performance known as the Pankratosword.* 

*It always took a bit of time to attune a new soul to the Shores' planar vibration, and so he would meet each one with the same story. Beginning, often, with what one witnessed beyond the waves on the golden horizon.* 



“There is something to be said of the skies above the Far Shores, which contain all that has been and is to be. It's the second thing you realize when you get here, and suddenly it all makes, well…slightly more sense.

Within the engorged object overhead sings/cries the entire Aurbis. And to its horror/wonder, so very much more.

Though this plane(t) has taken form by our will and way, our walk and wane, it is but a modicum of "in" within an expansive "out". A quantum of “yes”, though one of sorrow and refuge, in the abyss of an otherwise, all engulfing, “no”. Our vessel, far from what you called home, is alien to an endless and empty sea. Our shores, an intruder/child both within the domain of what could once be described as a Supernal Serpent. 

Composed of two separate beings, or perhaps, two distinct facets of one entity with neither beginning nor end, the shape of The Serpent is a single, brilliant eye, tethered to and by the pull of an invisible gaping Maw that lies at its opposite end. Together, they reigned as the only divines of this empyrean realm. Brothers, whose story is strewn about the firmament. 

The two revolve/fight around a common point, the Serpent's Center, and such is the equality of their influence/mass that this focal location was bent and curved by their push and pull, and given the form of Love. 

It's was only by fate, or perhaps fortune/misfortune that the sway of the swooning brothers brought the Serpents Eye closer to the celebrated Center first, as the Maw retreated away. It's radiance fell upon the beds of this anomalous plane(t), taking root. And such was its love for this land that it pulled its very skin around itself and then stood upright in an aberrant amalgam. 

The form of God.

The rejoice that followed was great, surviving even now as eternal, enantiomorphic echoes. But since it was only for a moment, and not one bit longer, this rejoice was incredibly short lived. The diabolical dance of the brothers-without-bound would see to its abrupt end, you see. For every step that Love took towards the Eye, it also had to take back toward the Maw in turn. The natural duality demanded it.

In fact if you listen very closely you can quite easily hear every note of fear that has forever been coupled with that of joy. Hope is pretending it isn't there, but just as loudly, rings despair. 

It was invented in the following moment, in which the Maw began its approach.

This endless hunger was everything the Eye was not; where the Eye only gave, the Maw only took. Perhaps it was in this reason that Love found its preference. Nevertheless, it was pulled into the Maw's tumultuous tides, and though it was not devoured, due only to the Eye's careful watch, Love was ruined beyond repair. 

Enraged, the Eye drifted towards the Maw, and get this, *moved at strange angles* to purge the hunger that was his brother, forcing him out of this violent void. Of course it is in repeating this dance that we were taught how to get to the Far Shores. And now you know.

Yet from the Maw's wake that made war upon Love's surface, its remains lied, crumbling, within the abyss. 

All that was left upon its wayward rocks was a single aspect/avatar of the Eye, perhaps the first made in the union of it with Love. As Love's final structures deteriorated though and the last aberration sat in sadness, alone in all reality, he used whatever will he had left to curse the Maw. 

But immediately after, he realized that without it, Love would not exist and could never again.

The mere contemplation of that notion eventually sent him spiraling/whirling into an insanity/enlightenment that existed as the simple truth that he was the singular result of all the forces in reality. 

And it was at this very moment that Love ultimately died, Creation was born/theorized/believed in, and he rose from the remains of this former world to leave it all behind. He soared into the center of the Eye, coated in the Love that was his form, to dream the pain forever away.” 


*By the story’s conclusion, what was once a mere whisper of a soul was made a fully realized Sailor of the Far Shores. And before him they always stood, ever baffled beyond words, maybe by their death, the universe in the sky, or perhaps the towering Yoku whose red robes could indeed blanket the entire Alik’r.*
 
*He always found solace in the stark silence of these daring diminutives as they stumbled somewhat aimlessly away; he regarded it as a sign of deep thought. But though Tu'Whacca still was not sure if anyone really cared, he was always happy to see yet another turn from the waves and head further inland, to join the others who have found the way, and await the coming of the New World.* 




Afterword: Hey guys, though I've been on these pages for a few years this is my first actual post here on teslore. Let me know what you think. Though there has been endless discussion on the nature of the Aurbis (as there should be), I've always been fascinated by the mystery surrounding the universe that came before. 

Thus, I've provided my interpretation of the realm of Anu The Dreamer from which the Aurbis was born. After reading many different sources about the actors and their forms, I present what I think may be a controversial/new way of looking at them, but one that I find quite fitting. 

[I give you my depiction of Anu, Padomay, and where they meet, the plane(t) Nir. A totality I've named the Supernal Serpent](http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/cygx1_ill.jpg). Gives a whole new meaning to the serpent eating its own tail, huh? 

This perspective is of course based upon the theory that the Far Shores are not in Aetherius but a place outside of the Aurbis, as the user [Samphire](https://www.reddit.com/user/Samphire) has perfectly illustrated [here](http://imgur.com/a/CtQ8p). My thanks.

Time being the funny, sometimes formless substance it is in this verse, I've imagined that those who make it to the Far Shores can quite literally retroactively witness the events of The Children's Anuad. The story is retold here by Tu'Whacca using his own terminologies, before the point I believe Anu begins The Dream, (just after he enters the Sun.)

Look out for a future post in which I intend to expand upon this model and explain the concepts of Satakal/the Aurbis, CHIM, Amaranth, the Walkabout, and all of those headaches we know and Love as sub gradient representations of this initial celestial interplay. In the mean time, please ask any questions you may have. I'd love some feedback on this!
