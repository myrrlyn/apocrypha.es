I am still new to TESLore, the Lore community, and discussions of such things, but here it goes.

NOTE: I would like to keep discussion on the topic I am talking about, not any other part of Mankarian Metaphysics.

One of the main arguments against Mankar Camoran's views is that Mundus, unlike the other planes of Oblivion, was created with the 8-gift limbs.

There is one major book one can look at that is independent of The Monomyth and Mankar's Commentaries, namely SITHIS.

The thing is, SITHIS only states that Lorkhan approached the Aedra as a friend and implies that they were essential in the creation of Mundus. This doesn't necessarily contradict Mankarian Metaphysics.

Let's look at what we know about the creation of Planes of Oblivion, namely from the game Oblivion. The Mysterium Xarxes helped Mankar Camoran create his own realm of Oblivion. When Martin Septim read from the Mysterium Xarxes to find out how to enter Paradise there were four required ingredients. I think it is safe to think that the ingredients that Martin read to create the portal are the same (or similar) to what Mankar used to create Paradise.

The main ingredient of focus on for the purpose of this discussion, the Great Welkynd Stone.

Welkynd Stones are cut from meteors, aka Aetherial Fragment. This means that the Great Welkynd Stone would contain a great amount of Aetherial energies.

With this we can know that Aetherial energy is required for the creation of Oblivion Planes.

The Planes of Oblivion that Daedric Princes made had an access to Aetherial energies that Lorkhan didn't. They had access to starlanes of the Ge, which only existed after the creation of Mundus. It also isn't hard to imagine that the Meteors in which Welkynd Stones are cut from come from the holes left behind by the Ge.

So, the question is where would one get the energies before the Ge fled to create an Oblivion Plane? The answer is obvious, the latent Aetherial energies that existed in the Aedra! We can even see this statement from Mankar Camoran (user):

&gt; As to the creation of the Mundus in respect to other planes of Oblivion, I see no difference. It is common parlance that the myriad realms of the Daedra Lords were created from surplus energies from the planes Aetherial. This is easily accomplished as the starlanes of the Ge pass through the very Void in which the Daedra make their home. The creation of the Mundus is no different. In absence of the Ge and their starlanes, Lorkhan drew surplus creatia from the only sources available; the Aedra you mortals so pedantically worship.

So, Mundus IS a Plane of Oblivion, just with a different source for its Aetherial Energies!
