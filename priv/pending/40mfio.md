From “Aurbic Myths:  A Treatise on the Mythopoesis of Politics” by Ko’heleth

…even a brief survey of Ahnissi’s writings refutes this fallacy.  But this one suggests a more subtle argument.

This one reminds you that there are two prominent narratives in Aurbic mythology.  The first, obviously, is the dichotomy of Man and Mer:  those who accept Creation and those who reject it.  Consider a moment that the core of this narrative is expressed in racial division.  One cannot disagree that this core Belief (to accept or reject) has mythopoetic importance – how one Believes will shape how one Becomes – but it is most often expressed racially, not in terms (say) of Anuic or Padomaic philosophy.  No, it is always Men and Mer and that should signify something to the astute.

For “Mer” is a derivation of “Aldmer”, those who participated in the Dream of Aldmeris.  This Dream was largely Anuic in its desire for what Was, and thus centered on the rejection of Creation.  All who embraced this Dream were dubbed “Aldmer”; it was this orthodoxy that defined their very Being.  And if Ko’heleth has his sugar (you know he does) it is disagreement with this orthodoxy that led to the shattering of Aldmeris.  

But Khajiit did not participate in the Dream of Aldmeris; nor did the Sload, Tsaesci, or Argonians.  [The Orcs did, yes, but theirs is perhaps the greatest tragedy of the Aurbis, seconded only by the sorrow of the Argonians.  But this one speaks of that another time.]

You see then that the labelling of “Betmer” (a disgusting and racist term) is not coherent with the true meaning of “Mer”:  it has another meaning, and Ko’heleth tells you it is both mythic and political.  That is because it is connected to the second great narrative of Aurbis:  the Enantiomorph, or Way of Three.

In its classical formation, the narrative of Enantiomorph centers on three approaches to a secret:  one who Guards it, one who Seeks it, and one who Observes the conflict of the other two.  Most modern theosophists suggest Men are the Guardians of the Secret (the acceptance of Creation) while the Mer are those who seek it, usually to destroy it.  The “Betmer” stand by and observe their war.  Why do the “Betmer” only Observe?  Because they are Mer and secretly on the side of those who Seek to Destroy.  Note the inherent racism against Men but also the relegation of “Beasts” to Observe – a kind of Othering.

Ah, but here is the rub.  In classic formulations the one who Seeks is the Thief and the one who Observes is the Mage.  But the Aldmer are not Thieves, they are Mages who use the very Creatia of Aurbis against Warrior Man.  Now you begin to see why Khajiit, especially, are relegated to Observe.  Because Khajiit are the ultimate Thieves – and while Warriors and Mages slaughter each other over the Secret…

…Khajiit enter the Tower and steal it for themselves.

That is why we are made to Observe, that is why we are called Beasts.  Because Khajiit are the secret defenders of Nirni, which is to say Creation.  And the Aldmer have never forgotten…or forgiven us.
