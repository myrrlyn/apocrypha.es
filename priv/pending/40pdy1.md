Dear King Torygg, please do not confuse us for those idiots in the east.

It has come to my attention that you fear we might war over the "Forsworn" rights to the city of Morkeard. This letter is to inform you that we have no intentions to do this. While those backwards fools in the east wish for a "United Reach" the civilized west does not want this. The druadach, or "Forsworn" are a hateful and xenophobic people and have no place among the gleannách. Our people and sína forsake them. We will not support them, or any endeavor of theirs. Every man and woman killed in their "crusade" is a shame upon our gods, and every monster made an abomination in our sight. Our views might only change when our cousins clothe themselves and act like the civilized people they pretend not to be. Until that day I wish you peace and long life.

Thus I spoke, Amiaóranach ánet de Jehenna -29th of Rain's Hand, 4E 201
