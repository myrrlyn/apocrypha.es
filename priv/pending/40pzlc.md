No one remembers now. No one remembers what crumbs are cast to the sea, lost to its floor as the above-feast is devoured. Lost in neglect they sit in the murky depths, never to see the table where they sat, for they can never truly Swim. So morose are they, as the silt and sand slowly inter them, obscuring them for good. A pity. Abandoned and misplaced in these crushing, muffled depths. Truly there is no hope for them. They will be forgotten in the silt and sand like countless cast-offs before. Oh how many we’ve seen. 

Great gold perches on white glass feathers reaching to the Sky-in-the-sky where the Birds would nestle to their sleeping mother’s breast and, in Her ear, coo their rousing songs. The great works of divine Man-gods who wrote their own Laws and, with Will and Voice, brought war upon the Merkin and their Kinwheel. The husk of a Merric world cast-off as all was returned to One, as it had always been before the Serpent’s heart was plunged to the depths to settle on its adamant plinth. The tales are myriad and the same. Save one.

It is a memory, as it always has been, deep, obscured and intrinsic, lurking within other sunken memories. Here for eternity is where we wait with tooth and claw, within the ruins of these fallen temporary worlds. We wait for that Dragon Day when Our-Ruddy-King-Twice-Felled will return to grant us legs and lead us to the shores of the above. There we will cast the Beast into the sea and claim our place eternal on the Forever New Land.

&gt; Here's my first proper story for anything TES related, I hope you guys enjoy it. It's a bit flowery and the ending's rushed, but it's a start, I guess. It was inspired by an idea brought up in one of the Lorecasts about the oceans being tied to memory. I decided to have a play around with that idea and tied to a certain race we don't really know a whole lot about. I'll leave you guys to figure out which one.
