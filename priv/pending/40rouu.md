Disclaimer: I only have a slight understanding of what the term "mananaut" implies, but in my eyes they are basically astronauts that traverse Mundus - and using the power of Elder Scrolls can visit other worlds.

Greetings, friends and scholars of the Imperial Scoiety of the Extraworldy Lands and Planets. It is today, 11th of Morning Star, the Two-Hundred and Ninety Eight year of the Fifth Era - welcome.

I am Moren Acraste, Imperial Mananaut and Dimensionrider from the Dragontail Extradimensional Portal Temple. Using technology derived from the Dwemer, we've been able to utilize Elder Scrolls to breach the very fabric of existence itself and visit worlds beyond our own. There are many intriguing stories to tell that many of my colleageus would love to share. But for today's presentation, I will focus on one specific world that I visisted several months back, and has since come to understand more.

Using the Elder Scrolls connected to my mothship, I was able to open a rift through Aetherius and into another dimension. The world I discovered was extraordinary, to say the least. Whereas most of the worlds we visit are desolate and void of life, this one was brimming with intelligent creatures and fascinating collectives. At first glance, the world would appear very similar to our own Nirn. It has verdant green plains, frosty mountains, arid deserts and deep blue oceans. It is similarly divided into provinces and regions as our own world - most fascinating.

These connections to our own have made me draw the conclusion that worlds are generally created through natural and divine process similarly. However, there are some key differences: This world appears to be more technologically advanced than our own, maybe even the Dwemer, but seem to be devoid of any form of magick. The inhabitants of this world all have their own sects, cultures, nations and leaders.

Our gods and demons all have their own morality and are neither benevolent or malevolent; their system of morality is incomprehensible to us. However, I can clearly understand the gods of this world are absolutely malevolent. You see, they have manipulated the inhabitants of this world to believe there are other worlds other than their own in their universe. While stuck on their planet, they tediously work to develop some form of transportation to take them to these worlds even though it is impossible. The gods have given them this belief to slowly drive them insane, stuck with the thought of forever being trapped on their planet.

Because of this gradual insanity, the inhabitants have taken to wage war on one another, and the world suffers. The people suffer, the plants suffer, the animals suffer. Yes, everything suffers, all because of these peoples' insistent belief that they one day will traverse space and time. I wager the inhabitants will be extinct within several decades, at most. I was able to extract some personal information about their world. What was their name again... oh yes, "Earth" or something.

Just a quick story I thought of and whipped up while eating. Thanks for reading!
