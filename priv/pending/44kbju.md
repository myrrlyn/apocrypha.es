I’ve just read your letter of the 17th to Aechia and she nearly laughed herself silly.  Little Faelee is becoming quite the firebrand, rather like her mother, no?

About the Dwemer – yes, it’s a shame we’ll never know more about them.  There’s certainly a good deal of scholarship – and theories endless – but the truth is even in the 6th Era we can barely understand their most rudimentary methods.  Everything seems to move in rebellion against their vaunted Logic; one dares to say they thought the impossibility of rolling squares or tetra-hexagonal matrices hilarious.  Imagine that – Dwemer with a sense of humor!  And yet the ruddy machines work.  Miracles – or something else.

Did I tell you about the Imperial from the Fighter’s Guild?  Wanted to know if I could put together a few Dwemeri Walkers to guard their hall.  I politely explained the situation – he got quite huffy.

I suppose the animunculi aren’t that difficult to discern; there are rumors of Mages Guild scholars constructing them as early as the Third.  I’m just not sure its wise.  The Last Men delved deeper than any into Dwemeri studies and you see where it got them.  I haven’t heard of any Remembered texts that touch on the matter, but they were likely spirited away by the Zero Temple.  You know how they feel about repeating the past.

Truth is, I’m a little nervous when people bring up Dwemer studies.  There something not quite…healthy…about the way they enacted their philosophy.  The physical artifices are fascinating, of course, but…it’s the deadness in their centurion’s eyes.  And the eyes of their likenesses.  Its as if they weren’t really there or never felt any connection to anything that wasn’t them.  Brilliant…but I wouldn’t want them living in the neighborhood.

Well, enough dark thoughts!  All our love to Eulan and Faelee.  Next time Jada and I are in the Imperial City we’ll have to try out Cornelius’ new restaurant in the Talos Plaza – I hear their comberry risotto is fantastic.
