The god Zenithar was first worshipped by the Nords and Aldmer under the names of Tsun and Xen. These two interpretations of Zenithar were radically different from the modern merchant god. The Nords saw Tsun as the god of trials, who tested men to see if they were worthy to enter Sovngarde. The Aldmer saw Xen as a god of morality, embodying the twin virtues of mutual aid and retributive justice. 

When the system of the Eight Divines was originally created by Saint Alessia, Zenithar was a god of strength, based primarily on the martial nature of Tsun and the vengeful nature of Xen. Although popular with warriors, he also had a sizable following amongst miners, who invoked him for the endurance to persist with their arduous work. In Nibenay, his role as a god of mineral wealth overshadowed his role as god of strength as trade became more important to the economy. Eventually, he became popular enough to assimilate Kynareth's role as patron of farmers and foresters. Two visions of Zenithar became dominant amongst the Nibenese cults: the working class worshipped Zenithar as a god of labor, and the merchants and nobles worshipped Zenithar as a god of good fortune. This has continued to the present day.

While the warrior Zenithar was still popular in Colovia, the laborer Zenithar became just as fashionable. Less accepted was the merchant's Zenithar, the Colovians viewing it as typical eastern decadence. Still, traits of the merchant Zenithar the Colovians respected were assimilated into the warrior Zenithar. He evolved from a god of endurance into a god of risk-taking, invoked not for the strength to withstand crisis but for the cunning to prosper from it. It was there that Zenithar first became known as the "god that always wins", as it was said he could find a way to profit from any possible disaster.  His martial aspects became less that of a soldier and more that of a mercenary or adventurer, and myths about his battles at the beginning of the world began to portray him as a trickster hero as opposed to a straight-forward warrior. Idols of Zenithar became popular in gambling venues, as a common superstition was that one could get good luck by kissing their feet.

The last major shift in the view of Zenithar came from Saint Adamus Cassius in the late Second Era. Combining elements of Xen and Julianosian natural law theory, he drastically reinterpreted Zenithar as an embodiment of universal principles of justice. While his doctrines were far too abstract to catch on in Colovia,  they were the origins of many Nibenese mystery cults, and the heretodox beliefs of the Cassians remain a major influence in the Church of Zenithar. Cassius himself ultimately committed suicide when threatened with life imprisonment by the Prince of Cheydinhal for sedition, yet his writings on ethics and economics are still seen as masterworks to this day.

With the ascension of Talos, Zenithar's martial aspects faded as a new warrior god became popular. Zenithar as laborer became the dominant view in Colovia, and his guileful traits were mostly merged back into Zenithar as merchant. Ironically, in the modern day worship of Zenithar as warrior is most popular amongst the Nibenese, being one of many outdated beliefs preserved by minor cults.
