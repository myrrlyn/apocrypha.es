The Xeril's Bane is a relatively obscure ship from the Second Era, often claimed to have arrived upon Tamriel's shores due to events happening centuries before during the Reman Dynasty. Though many restless sailors have made claims of their ancestors sighting such a ship, there has not been a single shred of evidence of its existence, even less of its home country. 

[It has been said that its captain, Captain Yori ut-Salumeht, was the fiercest pirate-queen of Lyg, clashing with legendary forces such as the All-Flags Navy and dueling Tiber Septim to a stalemate. The story with the most credence, judging strictly from multiple accounts, is the legend of the Crown Jewels of the Noormoqh Hegemony. The details of that legend are still being uncovered but the legend says that even Tiber Septim, blessed be his names, envied the jewels and coveted them for his own personal collection. An addendum to this addition to the library is forthcoming pending further vivisection of Hiaûŗochian myth-writs.](http://i.imgur.com/rlPl9uJ.jpg)
