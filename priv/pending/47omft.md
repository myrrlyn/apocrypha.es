*Translated from ancient Falmeris by Athellor the Enlightened*

&amp;nbsp;

From the great aperture of the architect flows the origin of the spirit,

Blessed is the arcane.

Radiance in the hour darkest, magicka stirred by the illimitable carcass,

Cursed is the deceiver.

Obscured is the dust, suppressed by frozen anamnesis.

Illuminated under the Dusk, reflected is the Dawn.

&amp;nbsp;

We look upon the void, suffused about it the vivid womb of creation,

Chosen are we in this rite to witness the act of our ancestors.

By convention made manifest, our purpose is elucidated,

Through faithful tribulation, we shall delineate the gait of Auri-El.

As recorded by Xarxes, representative of eternity, five and one mantra be our guide.

This covenant we do pledge, in the ushering of divine coalescence.

*Piece donated, or rather, forced upon the Imperial Archives by an Altmer known as Athellor. Legitimacy of the text is questionable, as the mer refused to divulge the location from which he discovered and translated it. Above this, he insisted on being referred to only as 'Athellor the Enlightened'.*

*Pretentious even for an Altmer...*
