The Maormer are so very interesting to me, as are the sea serpents they supposedly have tamed.

By applying metaphysical principles that apply to the better-known races, perhaps we can extrapolate characteristics of this mysterious people.

**Appearance**

This apparent colourlessness intrigues me to no end.  The only mer-folk that I can really compare them to are the Dunmer who have quite a different complexion than other elves, through Azura's curse.  Perhaps the Maormer have some convenant with or drawn the ire of some deity that changed their skin tone from the familiar to...whatever it is now. Just like the Dunmer are the colour of ash, like the stuff of their homeland around the Red Mountain, perhaps the Maormer have been changed similarly to reflect the qualities of the sea.

**The Seas they call Home**

Considering the discussions we have had this week on the Seas, Oblivion, Memory, the Soul Cairn and Oblivion, I wish to understand Pyandonea as well as can be done, absent any hard source documents from the games.  It appears that mortals can indeed carve out pockets of Oblivion to establish places to exist as immortals, such as the Soul Cairn and I suppose the world established by Mannimarco.  Could this be what Orgnum has accomplished?

This carries some interesting ramifications.  This would put the Maormer higher up on the Altmer Apostasy list than the Dunmer in terms of their Daedric leanings.  The Dunmer aligned themselves with Daedra which is bad enough, but the Maormer would have sought to become them.

**The Sea Serpents they have Tamed**

What, if any relationship, would these creatures have with the Dov?  If the seas are potentially the Waters of Oblivion (or at least connected to them), are they an inverse of the Dov?  The Dov without the blessing of Kyne?  Would they have any connection to the Aka-Tusk?

My personal impression is that yes, there is a connection with the Dovah, but they are not equal to them.  Perhaps the way the stars are reflected in the seas, the dragons have their reflections?  And the Maormer have tamed them in a way that Tamrielics could not (except the LDB, that is).  Perhaps these Aka-shards are more vulnerable in the seas, perhaps because of the reduced influence of Kyne.  Kyne could influence the surface only, unless she has a Sea-bound equivalent that affects the currents, but since this is not substantiated by lore, let's say she doesn't.

So the Maormer control the time-aspects of the Sea, which would explain their timelessness.  Which brings us to....

**Orgnum as Satakal (or at least an immortal being)**

If he has mantled or somehow assumed the identity of the ancient Yoku Worldskin, I would love to see a conversation between a Maormer and a Redguard.

Personally, no matter what the lore says, I find it unlikely anyone can mantle a being as all-encompassing as Satakal without becoming omnipotent, and if Orgnum cannot even conquer Summerset and was repelled by the Psijics of Artaeum, that is enough evidence that he is NOT literally Satakal for me.

I would believe that he has somehow subverted the mortal lifecycle through some kind of metaphysical means, the way that Tiber Septim, Vivec or Mannimarco did, although the mechanism is likely quite different.  Perhaps he has something in common with the Last Dragonborn or the Nerevarine in terms of becoming immortal.

Alternatively, perhaps Orgnum did not mantle Satakal, perhaps Satakal became Orgnum, as shaped by a new Aldmeri reality, and is super pissed at the ending of his Kalpa.  Maybe he's super confused and thinks that Tamriel is the Far Shores and is trying to claim it, and his former glory as the World Skin.  Perhaps this is his significance in ESO, alongside Molag Bal, who also ruled another Kalpa.

This would mean that Pyandonea is about as real as Yokuda, or maybe even is the remnant of Yokuda.

**Bonus crazy Saturday half-baked thought**

Consider this quote from [Sermon 1](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_1):

"For I have crushed a world with my left hand,' he will say, 'but in my right hand is how it could have won against me. Love is under my will only."

If there is a connection between the [Left-Handed Elves and the Maormer](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Lefthanded_Elves), perhaps the key is in this sermon, that the left-handed Elves did crush that world, destroying Yokuda and the ancient human civilisation with it.  Perhaps man is the right hand?

Also, Vivec, who do you think you are?

This is significant to me, because I learned recently that the 36 Lessons will appear in ESO, so there will be opportunities to connect the two, other than the mere appearance of a book.  Of those writings can be connected to the reality of this game...that would be beautiful...
