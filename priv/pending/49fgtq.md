Another take on this week's theme of cults.

---
The Order of the Black Worm, better known as the Worm Cult, is perhaps the most infamous cult in Tamrielic history. Founded by the Altmeri necromancer Mannimarco in the Second Era, the Worm Cult was dedicated to rising an army of the dead to conquer Tamriel by any means necessary. During the Three Banners War, Mannimarco used the Puppet Queen Clivia Tharn to stranglehold the Empire and summon his master, Molag Bal, and allow him to invade Tamriel. The invasion was thwarted by the efforts of the Vestige, and Mannimarco was presumed dead.

Hundreds of years later, he resurfaced in the Iliac Bay region, attempting to use the Totem of Tiber Septim and Numidium to conquer the land. While unsuccessful, Mannimarco was greatly strengthened thanks to possesing the Totem for nary a few minutes. With its strength, he was able to extend his life a few more years before attempting to destroy the Imperial Mages' Guild during the Oblivion Crisis. He was thwarted, again, and killed for good.

With their leader dead, the Worm Cult disbanded. However, following the return and subsequent defeat of Alduin the World-Eater at the hands of the Last Dragonborn, the Worm Cult rose to prominence again through conspiracy and subterfuge.

In 4E 203, an Imperial mage by the name of Romulin De Avolio garneded widespread attention in the Synod for his near-perfection of bringing a deceased person back to life. The person was barely functioning, but other magisters confirmed he was indeed alive after being dead - and it was not done using necromancy; no, De Avolio had made use of an advanced combination of Restoration and Conjuration spells to simultaneously restore the corpse's life force while reconstructing his dead cells. While not restored enough to function properly, he was indeed brought back to life, which made Romulin one of the most famous mages in the world.

Several years down the line, Romulin found himself as Archmagister of the Imperial Synod, head magister of the Cyrodiil Branch and lead magister of the overall organization. Through this time he made use of the Synod's widespread connections to further improve his unique magic. While attempted to be recreated by many other wizards, none of them succeeded, and it seemed Romulin was one-of-a-kind. Well, there was a very good reason for that.

What would not be publically revealed until years to come, Romulin had been communicating with the spirit of Mannimarco in secrecy. A devout believer in his teachings, Mannimarco taught Romulin many of his secrets he had learned over the years trapped in Oblivion. Only thanks to his immense magical proficiency and strength retained from the Totem of Tiber Septim was Mannimarco able to relay his knowledge to Romulin, who disguised the clever necromanctic arts as Restoration and Conjuration spells ombined.

As Archmagister of the Synod, Romulin gathered his most trusted compatriots - also followers of the long-dead Mannimarco - and instructed them to infiltrate not only the other branches of the Synod, but also every other magical institution on Tamriel; the College of Whispers, the College of Winterhold, House Telvanni, the Thalmor Justiciars, the Arcane University, and so on. While some had relative success, most failed to rise through the ranks fast enough before Romulin grew tiresome.

After planning for decades, Romulin was about ready to launch his master plan: An incredible spell reinforced by the Synod's, Mannimarco's and other institutions' artifacts, as well as an Elder Scroll which Romulin had spent years learning to read, would be cast atop the White-Gold Tower for all of Tamriel to see. Strengthened by his subordinates in magical societies across the continent, every dead corpse from High Rock to Black Marsh and everywhere in-between would rise from their graves, and Romulin would announce the resurrection of the Order of the Black Worm through thunder and song. He would turn the sky as dark as soot, letting it be known to all that Mannimarco had succeeded in death.

His plan would have succeeded to, if it weren't for that dreadful thing: Conscience. One of his subordinates, a Breton mage named Inira Ocroix, disrupted the incredible spell as it was about to connect to the Arcane University in Wayrest. Inira, through her time there, had come to the realization that Romulin had gone mad, and needed to be stopped. So she revealed her true intentions, and with the strength of their combined energies directed a powerful attack through Romulin's own stream of magicka. The blast struck his body with such force that he was thrown off the White-Gold Tower and right into the streets of the Arena District.

But Romulin was not completely defeated, however, as the Worm Cult declared itself alive and stronger than ever, ready to strike at a moment's notice, anywhere, anytime. To this day, many are searching far and wide for their hideouts, lead by Inira Ocroix, who is out to put the cult down once and for all.

Well, that was it. Not the most enticing story, I know, but I whipped it up in less than an hour - so there's that. Thanks for reading!
