*To Arcanist Dhanin at-Taneth*

I know that I gave you a foul look when you first gave me this assignement, but I swear to Morwha I take it all back now. We have made some fantastic discoveries here in No Shira, the catacombs below are far more extensive than we had ever hoped. Your friends in the Iron Wheel have also been far less brutish and uncivilized than I anticipated. Considering the various former "friends" of yours I dared not be optimistic. It is rare to see Ra Gada fortresses from the pre-Shinji period in such good condition, and the only one I have ever witnessed myself. Even with the close proximity to Abah's Landing I can impossibly figure out how enough water could have been delivered to the workers here. The ruins are many kilometres away from the nearest river, and that one dries out every summer. There are almost no records of the building of the citadel. It's construction appears to have been ordered by prince Hubalajad of Khefrem, or "prince Hew" as he is more known as, himself. It was supposedly built as a defensive location to be able stand against against an attack from the Alessian or Altmeri empires. I was also built to be a temporary home for the peoples of Abah's Landing in case of a crisis. Not much else has been known about the No Shira Citadel, untill now.

We have discovered several ancient reliefs and fresques who shed great light, not only on No Shira itself, but on Ra Gada culture as a whole. I will write further of the rest of these in a later message, but right now there is one specific relief that I simply must further discourse with you. It stands at a height of about three metres and a width of a little over one metre and doesn't seem all that important when you first look at it. It depicts two characters, facing towards eachother. The one on the right side of the relief has the head of a twisted man, with hair consisting of sixteen venomous serpents. He holds a sword in his left hand and holds his right arm up into the air, towards the Sun; wich is decorated with serpents. He wears the same regalia as all Yokudan Gods with depictions from this period. The other one, on the left side, has the head of an Ibis and the body of a man. He holds a Na Totambu Khopesh in his right hand, and holds his left arm up into the air, towards the sun; which is decorated with birds. "What is so special about that", you may ask, "Its classical Yokudan depictions of Satakal and Ruptga". Well, there is one further detail by the depiction of Ruptga. At first I did not recognise it, but one of the other excavators had once been a Cyrodiilic priest; who had visited the Temple of the Ancestor Moth. You'll never guess what he told me. He told me that it looked *exactly* like the Elder Scrolls he had seen there, *EXACTLY*.

To my knowledge the Elder Scrolls have not been mentioned by any name in any Yokudan scriptures, or before seen depicted like this. There is no known connection between Ruptga and the Elder Scrolls either, to my knowledge. However, as the origins of the Elder Scrolls are not known; might this mean that Ruptga is the author of these Scrolls? Would that mean that Ruptga can see both past, future and present? I have so many questions, and I was hoping that you perhaps could answer some them, and even if you can't; maybe your friends at the Taneth Mages Guild can help. This might be our one chance to make a name for ourselves.

This piece of Apocrypha is based on a relief I found in the No Shira Citadel catacombs while playing ESO's Thieves Guild DLC and that I found interesting. [I'll put a link to it here](http://i.imgur.com/8Yk8vnO.png).

Let me know what you think it means!
