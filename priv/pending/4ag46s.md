Librarian's Note:  Discovered in the wake of the Creatia Wars, this fragment hints at the existence of a futuristic animunculus in response to specific mytho-narrative difficulties.  Atti-Naram Hadal, an Echmer scholar at the University of the Imperial City, is the recognized expert on trans-Stream incongruities.
