&gt; Any doubts as to the Aldmeri influence on Yokuda are surely shed (pun intended) once one studies the [skin-archives](http://imgur.com/HkHdfqn) of the Satakals. Therein is the legend of Tall Papa's war with the Sleep Forest of Na-Hattu, and the roots of the long-standing hostilities that resulted when Dream-Sunder beat Boetius's son in a game of limb-riddles.
