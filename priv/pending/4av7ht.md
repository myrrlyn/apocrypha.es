*The following text is an excerpt from a series of incoherent scribblings found near the Maormeri settlement of Anganenhame in southern Hammerfell, 15th of First Seed the year 756.*

_____________________________________________________________

**To Orgnum, God of us All:**

**O** stands for *OIA*, for our Lord Orgnum is eternal - and so shall one day all true Aldmeri be.

**R** stands for *RACUVAR*, for cast down is what we were by the Altmeri traitors - and for that they shall pay.

**G** stands for *GORIA*, for in obscurity our Race thrives - but the day shall come when so is no more.

**N** stands for *NEN*, for are we not of water? - and in water lies the Memory of Aldmeris.

**U** stands for *UR*, for whe were the the Begining-Elves - and that we still are.

**M** stands for *MAGICKA*, for with Magic we shall conquer Nirn - and in time all of Mundus.

Grey is our skin, grey are our eyes, we neither ARE or ARE NOT. We are the MAYBE, and grey is its colour. So Orgnum teaches, so it IS.
