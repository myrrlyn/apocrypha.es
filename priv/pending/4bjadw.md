**Biography of the Mythic Dawn's Loremaster**

**Written in the 29th year of the 4th Era**

*While I was excavating the Lake Arrius Caverns a friend of mine in Skyrim made a surprising discovery, more fragments of the Loremaster's Journal! Using the confirmed fragments and sparingly using the fragments I think could be part of his journal, I have started to piece together a biography of this Mythic Dawn Loremaster.*

The life of the Loremaster was complicated. He was a Dunmer, a member of house Telvanni. He spent his entire time studying Ash magic as he was on the the Telvanni's Dust Adepts.

When the Empire and Morrownind came to an agreement to outlaw the magic and to have all the Telvanni mages who practiced it leave Vvardenfell, the Loremaster was unpleased.

Unlike the rest of the Telvanni mages, he wasn't too big on magic. He simply followed in his family's footsteps. Now, he was free to choose his own path.

Something lead him to the Temple, almost abandoned. He spent most of his time studying Ash Magic, but he did spend time as a Telvanni mage studying the Daedra. He was drawn to the temple and eventually joined it.

He expanded his knowledge of the Daedra, of the Gods. He became more and more focused on learning through the Temple and eventually discovered that they held an Elder Scroll.

Before he was able to get permission to read the Elder Scroll the Nerevarine came along and showed the people of Morrowind the truth about the Tribunal.

The Loremaster, once again, was alone. The Temple was collapsing, and so he stole the Elder Scroll and went to Cyrodiil.

Once there he traded the Elder Scroll for training as a Moth Priest. He decided to dedicate his lives to the scrolls, for he learned that only knowledge would not leave him to his suffering. It was something that could be embraced, but could not simply leave him, even if the scrolls could.

Not too long after becoming a moth priest he learned of a scroll that was hidden by his order, locked away. It was forbidden to read. It was designated *The Razor Scroll*.

Eventually the Loremaster came close to the scroll, with no one else around. He decided to put his training to use, he took the scroll and went to a secure location.

As soon as he opened the scroll images flooded his mind. He couldn't make sense of any of it, and within seconds he went blind.

He was expelled from the order of moth priests.

He didn't know what to do, but then a man came along, whispered a few words into his ear and he could see again. This man was Mankar Camoran.

The Loremaster and Camoran talked for a while, and it was surprising. Camoran was able to give such insights that the Loremaster had started to piece together from the scroll! This man had secret knowledge as well. But this was not all, the Loremaster was able to give some insights to Camoran as well, for while Camoran had access to a mysterious book only the Loremaster had seen the Elder Scroll.

The two started working together, the Loremaster became 2nd in the order of the Mythic Dawn. Camoran ordered the Loremaster to go to Skyrim and start building up the Mythic Dawn and to develop a backup plan, in case Camoran's plans failed.

*Not much more has been discovered yet. I still have yet to find out the name of the Loremaster, nor his fate. I have found out that he was once part of House Telvanni, the Temple, and was once a Moth Priest. I am planning to investigate further on these matters, as it seems like learning more about the Loremaster will give invaluable insights into the workings of the Mythic Dawn.*

Thank you for reading my second piece. I made this small biography about the figure in which most of my pieces will be about, as most will be records of his Journal. Maybe, eventually, I will write pieces from the perspective of the Loremaster himself.
