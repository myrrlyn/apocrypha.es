**The Blooming of Ald Adabala**

&amp;nbsp;

In the age of the Ayleid, in the western reaches of Ald Cyrod, was the city-state of Nilichiit; built upon a colossal hill and ruled by the zealotous Nilichi, King of Flowers. His domain was that of anon Colovia, and his vassals the jovial Men-of-Ge, whose worship was of the Welkyndvar. His kingdom was one of peace and prosperity, acclaimed by even it’s rivals for it’s glorious Column of Merid-Nundel, reaching higher than any jungled incline of the Highlands. However, it came to pass that Nilichi made contact with the creature Moravagea, or how it was known in that place. Writhing it’s way into the Bloom-Lord’s service, it revealed to the Ayleid the ‘tamalatu’, and the life-prince-to-be, how that sphere was stolen by the Ge-thief Merid-Nunda, and the prerogative of the bereft arthropod.

&amp;nbsp;

Inspired, Nilichi waged faith-war on the Ge-dra, defacing every visage and silencing each spoken word of the prince within his domain. Many came from places known and unknown, here and where, forgotten faces or those not yet known; merely three are enumerated whose people went on formed in the plane that is. First came the suppliant Men-of-Ge, culled by way of blossomed transmutation. Then came the faithful of Miscarcand, numbers exceeding even that of lost, or soon to be, Delodiil (Whose eidolons of umbrage are said to still clash against blooming Nilichiit each sodden season). It was at Ceysele, anon Talwinque, that the Miscarcandav and their epicine lord Nilyondil of the Salt perished by the floriated shade-swarm of Nilichi; of which no better convenience could the Star that would be known as Al-Esh have shone, for with callous Nilichi, they negotiated a sparing peace.

&amp;nbsp;

**Wilten-Star and the Autaracey**

&amp;nbsp;

It was not until the fall of Tor before the Wilten-Star made way to the blossomed slope of Nilichiit, whereupon scent of the charnel petals, he first knew sorrow. Awaiting the Alessian nonpareil was the Flower King, razor-like feathers arrayed in a bloom about his figure, and the roots of his faithful decorated about him, each singing recounts of their ancestors. Those runed cords chuckled at the sight of the Third, for his left-light gleaming compelled unto his character a visage of whited sepulchers. In response, the crusader disgraced the insectoid deity of Nilichiit, removing his boot to smear the very concept of it across the firmament, expectorating onto his soiled foot so as to exclusively remove the stain of the verminous would-be Prince.

&amp;nbsp;

Affronted by the act, the Ayleid unleashed a flurried veil of petals toward the knight, each of greater innocence than the last; surrounding Pellav and obscuring all but the ground beneath him; yet through reticent will and Mnem-begged reverence for saints elect, the knight flashed a light so great, it dissolved the swarming blades and blinded the Blossom-Lord to the illuminated world. Yet to the Wilten-Star’s vexation, Nilichi’s reliance on the light had long since faded. Adumbral blossoms of possibility surrounded him, demanding great vivacity of Nilichi. Biting beings of foreign planes closed in on the Slave Queen’s Prayer, but the silver-clad knight appealed to the insight of Jhunal-ianos, and flung his divine aegis to the Biters, leaping from ground to it’s blood-stained surface, and landing sword-first atop the King of Flowers.

&amp;nbsp;

In spite of the ostensible victory, rage consumed the knight; for the Ayleids’ scourge had wrest each adorned vertebrae, cleaved the Sorcerer-King through, lifted him high and begged his blood run onto his future-make flesh; and still, nothing could erase the scent of Mer-life from the air, nor silence the raging impulse within the knight. Residing in other-shadow, the Ayleid lord could not be purged in that make-plane, and so Pellav unleashed a mighty rage, leveling the hill upon which Nilichiit stood until only a field of macabre blossom remained.

*It is from this act of divine rage that we find the Nilichiit Fields, to this day remaining untouched by civilization, it’s perturbed beauty intimidating all but the most dedicated of pilgrims. Still, within the Iliac Bay, remnants of Nilichi’s faith persists in the Daedra Meridia’s recognition as the Lady of Greed, though the verity behind this notion has been lost to all but the Balfierans.*
