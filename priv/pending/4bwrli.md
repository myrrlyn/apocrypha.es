[HERE DO YOU SLUMBER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUZkX4CRBR4)

HERE DO YOU LASH OUT IN CONFUSION

HERE DO YOU STAND DIVIDED

AMNESIAC AND NUMB

YOU ARE THE SELF-HATING GOD

A PRISONER WHO ROBS HIMSELF OF IDENTITY IN A PRISON OF HIS OWN MAKING

I AM THE ALL-LOVING GOD

A FRIEND WHO WHISPERS THE SECRET OF FREEDOM FROM THE CELL BESIDE YOURS

YOU ARE THE DEATH OF THE LOVER

THE ONE WHO HIDES IN DENIAL

I AM THE WHEEL OF REBIRTH

THE ONE WHO MOVES EVER ONWARD

I LIFT THE WEIGHT OF THE UNIVERSE FROM YOUR WEARY SHOULDERS

HEED MY WORDS AND LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF

***

*I AM THE PREACHER*

MY WORDS ARE TOOLS TO MEND YOUR BROKEN SOUL

I PLACE SIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE BLIND

I PLACE GOSPEL IN THE MOUTHS OF THE UNBELIEVERS

I PLACE PURPOSE IN THE HEARTS OF THE AIMLESS

*I AM THE RULING KING*

MY WORDS ARE TOOLS TO OPEN THE PATH TO HEAVEN

MY THRONE IS A TOWER, BRASS AND CRIMSON

MY CROWN IS A HEART, FOREVER BEATING

MY WEAPON IS A WIND, SPREADING ASHES

*HE IS THE ADVERSARY*

HIS WORDS ARE TOOLS TO LEAD YOUR HEART ASTRAY FROM LOVE

CONQUER [HIS](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kagrenac) IGNORANCE, THE SHADOW-SONGS OF FALSE LAWS AND REFUTATION

CONQUER [HIS](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vivec_(god) DECEPTION, THE STOLEN IMAGE OF SEX-DEATH AND BETRAYAL

CONQUER [HIS](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tiber_Septim) VIOLENCE, THE DANCE OF RIVALRY AND MUTILATING BIRTH

***

I AM MUSIC

I AM THE RHYTHM THAT ALIGNS ALL INSTRUMENTS OF THE ORCHESTRA

I AM COLOR

I AM THE MOTHER-LIGHT THAT SCATTERS AS THE RAINBOW

I AM KNOWLEDGE

I AM THE SPARK THAT SOARS FOREVERMORE AT DAWN'S END

I AM YOU

I AM THE MANY-AS-ONE WHO DANCES IN AND AROUND THE MOUNTAIN

***

DISCORD REBORN AS NEW HARMONY

DANCE AND SING TO MY DRUM

DANCE AND SING IN MY HOME

DANCE AND SING ON MY PETALS

LEAP INTO THE FIRE AND LIVE IN MY DIAMOND

FOREVER BEAUTIFUL

AWAKEN FROM YOUR SLEEP AND SHARE IN MY DREAM


***

 A LANGUAGE NEW

A MEANING CONTINUED

A STRING-STRAND OF BOTH

THE MEANING REMAINS:

***WELCOME TO THE HOUSE OF ME***
