Some try to justify the blasphemous claim of Talos being a god by comparing him to the heroes Phynaster and Syrabane. They call us hypocrites for denying a mortal can become a god while worshipping ascended mortals of our own. We do not deny that a mortal can become a god. Was not Auri-El caught in Lorkhan's trap, and did he not escape and return to his kingdom in Aetherius? But worship alone does not guarantee godhood. The Tribunal of Morrowind had tens of thousands of worshippers, yet they proved to be little more than sorcerers with delusions of grandeur.

 Phynaster and Syrabane ascended through the sacred art of Dracochrysalis, lost since the falling of Crystal Tower. One can roughly translate the term as "time cocoon". As descendants of the gods, every mortal carries within himself the spark of the divine, although it has been heavily degraded over the generations. Through Dracochrysalis, this degradation is at first halted, and then reversed. Through this art, Phynaster and Syrabane reverted from Altmer to Aldmer, from Aldmer to Ehlnofey, and from Ehlnofey to Aedroth. 

Phynaster and Syrabane are no mere saints or demigods. They have become celestial spheres, like the Divines themselves. Astrologists can easily locate them through a telescope: Phynaster is in orbit of Auri-El, and Syrabane appears as the Warlock's Comet that crosses the sky every seventeen years. Now, how many star-charts list the planet Talos? None. There is no record of Tiber Septim pursuing the path of Dracochrysalis. He died a mortal, and his deification was little more but propaganda instituted by his heir Pelagius to grant legitimacy to the Third Empire.
