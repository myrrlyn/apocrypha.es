As Altmer, we have a responsibility to follow the duties of our caste. These castes are but reflections of the paths the Aedra took, for all children must follow in the footsteps of their fathers. Enlightenment comes only to those who embrace their role in Auri-El's great plan, and those who attempt to defy their fate bring only anguish to themselves.

Auri-El, as the soul of the Anui-El, embodies the divine law that is Anu. His children are the Wise, who discover this divine law through meditation, communion with the Aedra and philosophical inquiry, and advise the lower castes on how to follow it.

Xarxes was Auri-El's scribe, who recorded all of his triumphs in his beloved Oghma. His children are the artists, who continue his duty of preserving the accomplishments and genealogy of the Aldmeri through poetry, song, sculpture,  and tapestry. 

Mara was Auri-El's beloved wife, and queen of the Aldmer . Her children are the Princes, who care for their subjects as loving parents, and through practical wisdom derive ordained law from the divine law taught by the Wise. 

Trinimac was Auri-El's greatest champion, and though his soul may be lost to Oblivion, we remember the virtues he once embodied. His children are the Warriors, who enforce the law of the Princes and protect the Altmer from threats within and without.

Stendarr was Auri-El's envoy, who spoke the law to his people and who offered the ancestors of mankind mercy in exchange for surrender. His children are the Lesser Nobility, who convey the commands of the Princes to the Villeins, and act as ambassadors to the lesser civilizations.

Xen was Auri-El's great architect, who built the Tower of Ada-Mantia where he held court. His children are the Artisans, who through labor transform the base minerals of the earth into that which is needed by the Altmer.

Y'ffre was Auri-El's gardener, who sacrificed himself in becoming the first Earthbone. His children are the Villeins, who tend to the earth as farmers, foresters and miners, and likewise must share his fate of sacrificing themselves for the sake of the greater good.
