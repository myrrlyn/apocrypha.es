*29th Year of the 4th Era*

To Sir Octavius Tullius:

I thank you for the continued investments into the excavation of the Lake Arrius Caverns. While I am knowledgeable when it comes to piecing together and deciphering texts that we find, there is no one here that is able to examine the artifacts that we discover as many are complex with enchantments beyond what my team can understand.

Luckily, I have been able to correspond with an old partner of mine in Skyrim, name Jofrei Sorarsen. He has the best eye out of everyone I know when it comes to examining artifacts.

I would ask him to come and join my team but he seems to have discovered a cave system he thinks might be related to the Mythic Dawn branch in Skyrim. He does not yet have a team nor anyone funding his excavation, and I think it would be in our best interest if you were to fund his excavation.

I did happen to find a stange chest, it was small and was sealed with a magic rune. When I had one of the members of my team try and open it he was badly burned. Luckily we expected traps and had a healer with us who was able to prevent any lasting damage.

I have sent it to Jofrei in hopes that he will be able to find out how to open it and maybe even identify what might be inside of it. I told him to mail any of his findings both to you and me. You should be hearing from him in the not too distant future.

To Octavius Tullius,

My college Amiel told me to report any findings of my look into the chest to you, and I hope you won't be disappointed.

The chest itself had many gems placed in it and the magic seal seemed related to the gems. The way to open it was actually quite integing!

It was a pattern based on the symbols around the gems, each gem had a particular order and a particular way to activate it.

The order was Ruby, Sapphire, Amethyst, and then the diamond in the center.

In order to activate it a small fire spell was to be cast on the ruby, followed quickly by a frost spell on the sapphire, then a shock spell on the amethyst. After this I used an alteration spell meant to unlock doors on the diamond and then the chest opened.

Inside of it was a phial that was enchanted to hold something powerful. I was too cautious to simply open the phial and so went to the College of Winterhold to get help to find out what the contents of the phial was.

I practically had to fight to prevent those mages from keeping that phial as we found out that what was in the phial was some of Aedric Blood! Well, not blood in the sense that you or I bleed, but Aedric power in the same sense that Daedric Artifacts are made of "blood" of the Daedra that made it. We have yet to precisely identify which of the Aedra it belongs to, but the sole fact that this exists is simply fascinating! For what purpose did the Mythic Dawn hold such a treasure?

This will take up quite a bit of my time as I am also trying to excavate a ruin all by myself at this point. It is south of Dawnstar and is unstable. I have already found a shrine to Dagon close by, and so I assume that this ruin could very well be connected to the Mythic Dawn.

I hope that this discovery is enough to make you consider funding my own excavation as the conditions of these ruins is not ideal for a single man.
