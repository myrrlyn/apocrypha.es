Gather round, you squawling brats.  Listen well to these lessons, taught from the war-song of the great warrior Gorrock, lest you repeat his mistakes.  Hey, you in the back!  Put her down!  Do I need to break your arms!?


*As the light of the First Empire vanished from the land and its people fell once more into glorious conflict,*  
*There was one warrior who stood above all the rest,*  
*Gorrock, Brave, Proud, Bloodthirsty Gorrock, Champion of His people.*  


*As the lands of Man and Mer and Beast descended into chaos,*  
*He kept His people safe from harm, hidden in their secret settlements high in the mountains,*  
*And Gorrock, Cunning Gorrock, He allowed no one to find them.*  


*As the wars dragged on, the Orcs prepared for their own conflict,*  
*They hammered and smelted, forging arms and armour for the battles ahead,*  
*And Gorrock, Patient Gorrock, He waited for the right moment.*  


*All at once, the mounts of Wrothgar split in twain,*  
*Releasing the war-hungry Orcs upon the world,*  
*And Gorrock, Wise and Powerful Gorrock, He was leading them.*  


*And on that day, much blood did spill in the Arena,*  
*Covering the ground, the trees, the cliffs, the sky,*  
*And Gorrock, somber Gorrock, He paused to reflect.*  


*And so the Orcs returned to their mountain homes,*  
*Flush with victory, treasures, supplies from their conquests,*  
*And Gorrock, Pondering Gorrock, He returned to his Hearth.*  


*His wives tended His wounds, sang His praises,*  
*His children begged to hear His stories, His lessons, His approval,*  
*And Gorrock, Proud Gorrock, He was home.*  


*And yet, within the rugged mountains of Wrothgar,*  
*There stirred a darkness, seated deep within the heart of an Orc,*  
*And Gorrock, Unbeatable Gorrock, it lusted for His doom.*  


*This Orc, this Swine, this jealous Pig-Thing,*  
*He was determined to rule, to control his people,*  
*And he saw Gorrock, Trusting Gorrock, as an Adversary.*  


*And so, when next the Orcs planned to move from their home among the peaks,*  
*It is said one Orc in particular left before the rest, and made for Daggerfall,*  
*And it was there he told the world of Gorrock, Fierce Gorrock.*  


*And when the Orcs fell upon the world once again, with sword and shield and spiked helm,*  
*This time, the world was ready, and turned back the host from the high mountains,*  
*And Gorrock, Unshakeable Gorrock, He was clapped in irons and beaten, blamed for this most shameful defeat*  


*The Orc conspirator and his clansmen,*  
*Quickly seized this opportunity, killing and haranguing their way to the top*  
*They questioned Gorrock, Immoveable Gorrock, for weeks.*  


*”Where is your hoard of gold?!”*  
*”Where are the spoils of your many conquests, the fruits of your labours?!”*  
*But Gorrock, Proud Gorrock, He did not break.*  


*He resisted their empty threats,*  
*Their hollow tortures,*  
*Their endless demands and ultimatums.*  


*And yet, at the last, He faltered.*  


*For before Him they brought his youngest daughter,*  
*Barely of age and yet shouting defiance at every turn*  
*And the promise was made,*  


*”Twice unto her what is done unto you,”*  
*They swore, the avarice ugly in their eyes,*  
*”If you speak to us now, she goes free, as do the rest of your line.”*  


*And Gorrock*  

*Weak*  

*Pathetic*  

*Sniveling Gorrock*  


*He saw His daughter’s fear,*  
*Hidden beneath the bluster,*  
*And made His decision.*  


*So listen well, to the song of Gorrock*  
*And take it as a cautionary tale*  
*For though you may be strong of arm and stout of heart*  
*Secure in your line and pure in your wisdom*  

*Know that, just like Gorrock,*  


*Gorrock, who was once the best of us*  


*You too can become complacent*  
*Can be undone by that most sinister of poisons*  


*Betrayal*
