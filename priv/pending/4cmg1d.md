*By Haelzunurukk the Khimrykif*

**L** ordly is Amoncrul. Cruel ancient Ayleid king. He ruled from Loriasel of old, where MNEM was word of truth.

**O** bdurate is Baron Thirsk. Winged horror from dark caverns. He was who through trickery ruled Solstheim Skaal, and through trickery mantled Daedric lord.

**R** avenous is Glorgoloch. For he was once a hunter among Reachmen, but while his body is bloated flesh he lost his only mouth.

**D** eadly is Charr. Grand Immolator among Ogrim incendiaries, who burns and slaughters in the name of our Lord.

**M** ighty is Khrogo. Royal Daedroth-king among the Soul-Shriven of pocket-plane Morbalodiil 345, and loyal servant to Molag Bal.

**O** bservant is Lady Malygda, Lyg's living High Fane. From within her web of lies she watches mortals wither and die, presenting to some gifts of immortality in Cold-Harbour.

**L** ove-stealing is Nunatak, ice-sculpture from Sinus of Takubar. Freezes he does to all beating hearts, and devours them with his portal-mouth.

**A** gonizing is Malorigarzonbalax, Screeching Matron to all Clannfear. She who eats time and regurgites rebirth. Breaks bone she does with iron jaw, and then cries out laments with screeching sound.

**G** rim is Volghass, with Daedric soul and Mortal bone. Once Soul Shriven slave, now awarded with a grotesque new form for his sacrifice to Bal.

**B** ringer of Depravity, Ysenda Resplendent the Harvester is. Eldest of Soul-Stealers she is and was. She kills as she pleases and defiles where she chooses. Despite unforgiveable illoyalty, blessed for her cruel splendor she has been.

**A** ngler for knowledge, Zoal most certanly is. He BECAME out of will and rewrote history through might. He watches and waits for wisdom and lore, while always destroying and befouling wherever he passes.

**L** ORIA AE MORIDRA MOLAG BAL. MOLAG BAL AE MORA-ARAN. LA DAE, FALVEASORN AE.
