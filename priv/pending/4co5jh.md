**CITIZENS BEWARE! NECROMANCERS ARE ON THE LOOSE!**

The Pocket Guide to the Empire spells it out, clear as day: Whiterun has ALWAYS been a friend to necromancers!

NEVERMIND THAT ITS NEARLY 200 YEARS OLD. If anything, the dear old pocket guide, which still graces every shelf in every library from here to Elsweyr, has only become more accurate in time! Especially with the fall of the Septim Empire, and this terrible Civil War — The Hörme are peddling themselves as the third option between Solitude and Windhelm, but DON’T YOU BELIEVE IT.

Varnius Junius, up in Haafingar has already sent me word that Wolfskull Cave is infested with necromancers, flying tattered Septim banners. These foul necromancers believe Potema Septim still clings to life, seeking to re-establish the Septim Empire in her name!

The threat they pose to the Empire, Skyrim and Whiterun most of all CANNOT be underestimated! She’s already begun to gather men to her banner, and every night that passes, the Wolf-Queen comes closer to the living world! Before long, she will have her armies on our front steps, and unless they are stopped now, it will be too late!

But our leaders CONTINUE to do nothing! We must STAND TOGETHER and DEMAND that Wolfskull Cave be cleared out, and the areas around Whiterun be cleared of necromancers! Potema Septim must be destroyed, and her Hörme agents routed out! 

JUST WHAT is Jarl Balgruuf getting up to in Dragonsreach? What’s this about his court wizards sending hired swords into Bleak Falls Barrow? Searching for “ancient Nord wisdom”, are we now, Secret-Fire?? And after all, we’ve ALL heard the rumors — Balgruuf the “Greater” was in Solitude when Ulfric assassinated High King Torygg! **WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE?**  Why did he rush to Whiterun and declare the hold “Neutral”?  Could it be he fears what the Civil War would do to his necromantic empire?? Or perhaps he’s ready to take advantage of the soon-to-be-steady supply of corpses?!?!

TAKE HEED, CITIZENS. The Hörme stalk these very streets. They work with you, they drink with you, THEY PLAY WITH YOUR CHILDREN. The Hörme are REAL, and they’re on their way for your CORPSE! **DON’T LET THEM TAKE IT WITHOUT A FIGHT!**

Flyer was found outside the Bannered Mare, with additional copies located around the Plains District. Jarl Balgruuf was immediately notified of their existence. He ordered all copies rounded up and destroyed.
