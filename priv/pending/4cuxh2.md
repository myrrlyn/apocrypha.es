* Keep in mind that I am not native to English, fauxpas may occur.

&gt;Listen, my faithful friends and I will talk till the end

&gt;about the three times natural, Meridia - Azura - Nocturnal.

*♪*
&gt;*The day is bright and dark is the night,*

&gt;*but why is that so, you might ask in awe.*

&gt;*The void embrace Nirn, try to convince and earn,*

&gt;*but you shall know, Gods are here to avoid it so.*

&gt;*Princes of twilight and plot, hidden in pride and forgotten.*

&gt;*Is the three's will lost for us, so is wish for decay the last.*

*♪*
&gt;*The light of Magnus shines down the sky's spine,*

&gt;*keep us here warm und fill life with energy in it's barn.*

&gt;*But the blue that you enjoy is in reality Meridias convoy.*

&gt;*She bless us with colour, spare from the undead's stigma.*

&gt;*Their bloodlust shall vanish and dark creatures be banished.*

&gt;*What is rotten shall not wander, the daylight becomes a reminder.*

*♪*
&gt;*The Night is the holy mantle of Nocturnal to defend it*

&gt;*from real dark to pass, when Nirn spins and Magnus is less.*

&gt;*She cloaks her servants, pickpockets of the earnest.*

&gt;*Her Luck is given to unsee, what's not here to be seen.*

&gt;*Her gentle touch triggers sleep and within we are pulled into deep.*

&gt;*Only made fires lit her dress, dancing with torchbugs without rest.*

*♪*
&gt;*The world between them is held by no other, than*

&gt;*the mother of mystic and her red charm endless seductive.*

&gt;*The dawn early and late is Azuras way of her trade.*

&gt;*Begging for the sun to arise, the others better hope to decry.*

&gt;*Follow her warm prayer and in bliss stay with her,*

&gt;*you will hear what is to come and know what is left undone.*

*♪*
&gt;*The turn of our planet in the hand of foul god's hands?*

&gt;*But have faith no fear, this is the cost we must bear.*

&gt;*We should know better, will it avoid the void to natter.*

&gt;*They are there as long as you live, rarely take and always give.*

&gt;*Our hearts beat day and night, with their eyes on our side.*

&gt;*Keep an eye back to them, ensure their pact do not bend.*

*♪*
&gt;Good Bye, my surprised audience, I am at my end.

&gt;Never forget what I told, carry in the heart that you hold.
