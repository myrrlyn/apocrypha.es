When the Aldmer began constructing White-Gold Tower in the Merethic Era, in what was then CYR-ODIIL, they did so to mirror Tower Zero on Balfiera. But when the great Tower, which had its root in the heart of Nirn and was devoted to the Ten Ancestors, stood almost finished as the heart of the Heartland there was one piece missing. White-Gold had no Zero-Stone, and the Aldmeri mages found themselves unable to replicate the Stone of Creation. No matter how they tried, all who touched the Adamantine Stone died or became irreversably disfigured. The Aldmer of Cyrodiil, who had begun calling themselves the Ayleidoon, thought that it was the Aedra who had abandoned their people. Therefore the Ayleids began building great shrines to the Magna Ge of long-forgotten Aba-Lyg, who were the followers of the Architect of Nirn himself. The Ayleids built many hundreds of shrines to the Ge, from Daenia to Dawnmead. They built grand chapels to Merid-Nunda, mother of Light. Light became the center of Ayleid culture, and the Aedra were largely forgotten. Many years went by, but they Ayleid people continued to build Star-Wells, or "Twyll", in devotion to the Magna Ge. And the devotion of the Ayleids gave fruit, for one day lay something in every Twyll. What lay there were silver-like stones, who pulsated with the power of the Plane adjacent. They Ayleids named them "Telvarlais", or "Silver-Stars".

The Ayleids brought all Telvarlais that they could find to their Tower of the Ten Ancestors. They took them to a place deep beneath the Tower, a place that Alessia would later name Barathrum Centrata, which means "Oblivion's Center" in the Nedic tongue. There they placed the Telvarlais at the base of White-Gold. There the Stones melded, and started climbing like a plant towards the Tower's peak. There the Telvarlais brought life to the Tower and transformed CYR-ODIIL into a jungle, like that of Aldmeris. The Tower broke the Dragon, and rewrote history as it saw fit. When the Ayleids forged the great Soul Gem Chim-el Adabal out of the blood of LKHAN, they used it too feed souls to the Tower and to the millions of Telvarla Stones that upheld it (this has led many Cyrod "scholars" to beleive that Chim-el Adabal is and was the Stone of White-Gold, because in their ignorant minds a Tower can only have one Stone). This continued until Al-Esh's "Slave-Rebellion", in which she overthrew the Ayleid overlords. After Al'Esh's rise to power the Telvarlais were almost completely forgotten, as the Chim-El Adabal became the symbol of Al-Esh's covenant with AKHAT. The Telvarlais are today only remembered by a few, and are often referred to as "Tel Var stones".

But you should know this, reader, that the Telvarlais are what uphold White-Gold and the entirety of the Mundial Plane. Should they ever be damaged in any way, the Mundus will be permanently and irreversably damaged.
