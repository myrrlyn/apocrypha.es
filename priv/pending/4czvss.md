*Translated by Raelys the Signifier*

&amp;nbsp;

*Remnants of this poem were found within the halls of Vilverin, and have been pieced together as successfully as possible, with the valuable consultation of [REDACTED] in restoring the lost script. While the format has remained largely true to the original text, rhyming scheme has been implemented in place of the original Ayleid design (See: Addendum) to appeal to modern readers of the Empire. As far as myself and other historical scholars can surmise, this poem was written by an Ayleid Archidist, the mage-masons of old; and details the creation of an Ayleid tower, and possibly the construction means of Ayleid cities as a whole.*

**“**Seek, Seek

Seek the stone, it’s pallid hue agleam

Indulge it with an aether touch

And heed it’s woken mneme.

&amp;nbsp;

Bring to vivid Welkynd place

Where beaming Magnav clutch

And there you’ll find the mythic pace

With which to tune your touch.

&amp;nbsp;

Open maw and open hand

Attune to Merid high

And beckon toward the somber land

Great Child from the sky.

&amp;nbsp;

Within its brilliant light so true

Is that which you demand

So pray upon that azure hue

Great spire whence you stand

And in that offered tone accrue

Blessed favour of the Grand.**”**

**Addendum**

&amp;nbsp;

*Ayleid poetry, as far as translation can tell, had no conventional rhyming schemes, but rather, mirrored words according to correlated meaning. Their poems were largely didactic, though few of a more artistic nature have been discovered. Poem structure would be as follows: Four lines, then four would be listed, totaling eight. After this initial eight lines, four lines, then six would continue, totaling ten; although these ten would be separate from the mirror-meaning scheme established within the initial eight lines.*

&amp;nbsp;

*Where rhyming scheme has been implemented in this Tamrielic translation is where such mirror-meaning structures would have been located. Such a choice was made both on account of modern readers of the Empire, as well as it being near-impossible to establish the intended meaning of such words in Tamrielic, due to the complex nature of the Ayleid language.*
