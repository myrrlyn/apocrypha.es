From the beauty of memory, comes the ugliness of age.

*"Av lormantia bala, haelis morae shanti."*

From the power of Oblivion, comes the horrors of the Daedra.

*"Av malia Ayleidooni, dagon merie shanti."*

From the love of the Ayleids, destruction of the peoples comes.

*"Av  buro agea, nagaia shanti arani."*

From the knowledge of the slaves, comes death to the kings.

*"Ry varlais sile av Telvarla-El, lattakyndi racuvar"*

As the stars shine upon White-Gold, the light-children are cast down.

*"Ry loria sunnae seli, molag pari nou hame."*

As darkness blesses the halls, fire grips our home."

*"As baunada alata."*

By the mighty gods of light.

*"Ae ede."*

It is the end.
