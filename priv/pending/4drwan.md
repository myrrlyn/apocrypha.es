**Heart's Sapphire: The Celediion Union (Continued)**

Before becoming an official province of the Empire in the current era, the Celedillon Union was considered the largest city-state in Tamri-El's history. According to the Imperial Geographical Society, who were finally allowed to conduct a census on the realm, the Union is as large as the Imperial Province itself and is divided into numerous regions, some of which are mostly uninhabited by civilized folk. The population of the Union is mainly comprised of Cuhls, nomadic Minotaur clans, Dreugh from the Harajk tribe, and - if rumor holds true - hidden conclaves of Wild Elves (although these sighting have become rare in the last century). The odd outsider or two may be spotted as indentured servants or exotic bodyguards for the highest nobility, and trade caravans from neighboring lands are quite common in the Union's most important cities (see, Side Bar: Beyond Nucyrod).

The geography of the Union might invoke nostalgia for the common historian, as it is mostly comprised of jungles and temperate rainforests like the Cyrodiil of old, before it's beauty was changed by the blasphemous Tiber Septim. The northern territory gradually grows more rugged and less thick with vegetation before giving away to the Reman Savanna and the Sifrian Mountain Range that marks the northern border, while the south becomes more wet, hot, and foggy as it transits into the Boiling Moor that marks the southern border.

While there are numerous river villages scattered throughout the central jungle syatem, as well as farms and vassal towns in the northern grazelands, there are only four major cities in the Union - Dor, Hestra, Kreath, and the capital, Medea. These settlements are large, grand, and built to withstand sieges (although the Union has yet to be successfully invaded by any foreign power) with their massive walls and siege engines. Each of the capitals are built in the shape of the Sapphire, and separated into five districts - the Market District, the Residential District, the Holy District, the War District, and the Under District, where the Underpalaces of the Mede Family reside. ~~According to the Medean annuals, which this humble scribe was able to read in full, the eldest son-mirror of Cuhlecain, Titos Mede, commission for this design as to laugh at the sacred ruby-splattered diamond of the False Empire, which was a heathen death sign brought to Tamri-El by the Eastern Ouroborus. His younger brother-selves, slightly imperfect as they were, were given seats of power in the other cities so that their more ashen forms may be kept whole by the soul of their Father., while Titos and his Ebon-blessed 1000 conquered the Imperial City with mere strength alone.~~

**Side Bar: Beyond Nucyrod**

*"Is every thought a story, and every story a legend , and every legend a myth, and every myth a world? And when these worlds are forgotten, where do they go? Or do they stay, out of mind but in sight, awaiting entry if one just remembers there is a grain of truth in every lie."*

Although the Union is a land outside of what we regard as normal space and time, it is still a land on a continent much like Tamri-El, and like all lands it has neighbors it must deal with on both peaceful and militaristic terms. But of these lands we have little knowledge, and only two are confirmed to be more than mere rumor. The southeastern Bogdom of Rogon and it's silver plated men have attempted to evade the Union with their saurian war-beasts numerous times, but have failed thanks to the will of the gods and Celediilon perseverance. The infamous Knighthood of Twil, to the north of the Sifrian Peaks, has traded skyshards and mithril with the Cuhls for as long as they remember, and often show up unannounced in their lands singing their Ge Songs.
