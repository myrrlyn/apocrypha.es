**LORIA PADO NIRN AE AI**

Those are the words of Creation, and they are the chains of the Mundus. They are heard chanted in the west, our very womb. They are heard screamed in the east, our deathbed. When SATAK-AL ate Yokuda the mighty warriors of Ald-Yokudea saw no consolation in the past, they fled to NU-TAMRIEL, where all was now. When the passing of time froze Kamal, Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal fled towards PADO-TAMRIEL. For he had seen the LATTA GORIA AH MNEM. But Ada'Soom dir-Kamal failed, while the Ra Gada succeeded. This is because the MANTIA AURI-EL: "Time flows ever forward." That is why the CYRI MUNDEX lies below TAMRIEL - as - Tamri-El. The wheel turns ever onward, always to the east, never west. The Towers are Mundus.

**AZURE-KYND DAE-DRA**

Those are the words of Oblivion, and they are the chains of the Aurbis. For Oblivion is eternal, and it prevents the wheel from turning ever east. Oblivion is the eternal realm, and it is the home to all things eternal. Oblivion is unlimited, and so are its inhabitants. Oblivion has always been ans shall always be. So this i write, wrote, and shall write, in honour of the Daedra: AZURA AE BOETHIAH AE CLAVICUS VILE AE HERMA-MORA AE HIRCINE AE JYGGALAG AE MALACATH AE MEHRUNES DAGON AE MEPHALA AE MERIDIA AE MOLAG BAL AE NAMIRA AE NOCTURNAL AE PERYITE AE SANGUINE AE AHEOGORATH AE VAERMINA AH OIA!

**AURIG MNEM AE LATTA**

Those are the words of AETHERIUS. AETHERIUS is the gate to the Void, the gate to CHIM, the gate to AMARANTH. Here the MAGNA-GE mourn the loss of ancient LYG, but MAGNUS himself is not to be seen. It is the resting place for all mortal souls, for those who are dead and are forever powerless. For those who have fallen. It is the Far Shores to the Yokudans, and Heaven to the ancient Nedes. It is so close, yet so far away. It is the end of all things, it is the locked gate. AE EDE

**LORIA**

That is the word of the Void, of it I shall not speak.
