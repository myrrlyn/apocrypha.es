NOTE: One of my favorite speeches comes from Spinner Girnalin in Elden Root: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Girnalin#Dialogue and so this is essentially another Spinner telling the story with a slight twist because why not?

Dear sister,

I stayed with a pair of bosmeri sisters for the night. The eldest is apparently a Spinner, the bosmeri equivalent of a priest, supposedly. She says she’s rather new to the ‘craft’ but she’s still learning. I asked her about Spinners. According to her they tell stories of whats, so I was told. I decided I'd write their story down, since she doesn't write them.  

“Sister, tell me a story about the stars.” The youngest asked her.   I implored that I wished to hear the story too.  
“Well, okay. So in a previous story I told you about Y’ffre’s song to the stars and how the stars danced and swayed to it, and still do in that song's memory, yes? What I didn't tell you is about the stars and their connection to Aetherius, and of the constellations. As Y’ffre’s story teaches us, the stars and the sun are holes within the wall of night by Magnus and other spirits in their escape from Nirn to Aetherius.”  
“Stars are spirits?” The young sister asked suddenly.  
“No, Zyniel, don't interrupt. As I was saying, these stars and the sun are holes and they let the light of Aetherius come through.”  
“What are stars then? Just motes of light?” The younger sister implored once more.  
“They are realms, sister. Just as Oblivion is comprised of many different realms, so, too, is Aetherius. The stars we see are doors into these realms, but, just doors open and close, so too, do their realms as they travel across the sky.”  
“I don't get it. What about the constellations?”  
“Think of them as a collection of realms under one sign. For instance, you were born under the Lord. The Lord is under the charge of the Warrior. It is said that the Aedra themselves have a hand in that. An old story even tells of their realms existing there, but it was told by someone touched by Sheogorath. Of this, I can say no more. The story has yet to be told, it only has a beginning, you see, and I don’t wish to spread unfounded rumors.”  
“Can we get to these realms? Can we get to the stars?”  
“All I can say for certain is that the souls of mortals become spirits of another kind in Aetherius. As to whether we can get there, well, it’s hard to get to Oblivion as it is, I’d imagine it’d be harder to get to That is yet another story to be told for another time, sister. You see, I haven’t heard all of the songs on-
