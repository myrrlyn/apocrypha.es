Lesser Deities of the Khajiiti Pantheon

by Jawzaar

Though twelve main deities are followed by the Khajiit, countless more exist in their pantheon. Some of these deities have popular cults in areas of Elsweyr despite not typically being seen as major deities.

Daviirna, the Frisky One, is patron of sexuality among the Khajiit and is considered to be Mara's twin sister. Her worship is intrinsically tied to that of Mara, and recieves no stigma like that of her Cyrodillic counterpart
Dibella's.


Jo'Ranar, The Scholar, was the child and student of the sun god Magrus before he took on his own sphere of protecting all the books in the world. He is now the Morning Star, and collects the knowledge of the world and doles it out
to the worthy. His cult is popular among Khajiit mages, where he is worshipped alongside Magrus as one of the guardians of magic and wisdom.

Ri'zet, the Working Cat, serves as a father figure and the husband of Mara where he is seen as an example of dedication and hard work. He toils hard to provide for his litter and serves as an example of family bonds and virtue.

There are countless other cults and sects among the Khajiit, though these are the three main cults of minor deities. And this one is to tired to carry on with the rest.
