**[This note, which was recovered from Skywatch Manor, seems to have been ripped in pieces, and it is spotted with what seems to be both Elven blood and tears. It appears to have been one of the letters mass-printed before the coronation aswell as cremation of King Hidellith, with only a few words being handwritten. - Canonreeve Urmodil of Skywatch]**
