First Empire
---
[Alessia/Al-Esh/Paravant/Periff/Paravania/Aleshut](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alessia), born and raised in [Sardavar Leed](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sardavar_Leed), she was the first to create the empire after leading the Alessian Slave Rebellion at [Sancre Tor](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sancre_Tor) and capturing the White Gold Tower from the Ayleids. Along the way, she established a new religion known as the 8 Divines, and was given the Amulet of Kings by Akatosh, all with the help of her champions: Morihaus, and Pelinal Whitestrake. Upon her death, she was buried within Sancre Tor, a tradition that Reman I and his successors would carry on, although some say that she was buried in the Imperial City on the site of the temple of the One.
 
Her successor, [Belharza the Man-Bull](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Belharza#Belharza), son to Alessia and Morihaus the bull man, and aspect of Kyne. Nothing is known of him except that he was the first Minotaur, and that his rule was troubled by large Ayleid hordes, and intimate correspondence was held between them in the Library of Dusk. Alessia's grandson and Belharza's son [Ami-El](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Ami-El) took the rule next, and he was known to have helped fight against the Direnni Hegemony by lending his forces to the western reach of skyrim in 1E 358.
 
[Gorieus](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Gorieus#Gorieus) is the next ruler, and it's said his crowning ceremony was somber in accordance with the rules of the Alessian Order. His crowning ceremony was visited by High King Kjoric the White, who would later rebel against him. Gorieus' forces would kill Kjoric in the Battle of Sungard, however, Gorieus would fall at the hands of King Rislav Larich of Skingrad
 
The last known ruler of the 1st Empire is [Hestra](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hestra), who expanded the empire, adding Colovia, the Reach, and High Rock to the empire during her reign. She would eventually capture the infamous pirate Red Bramman during her reign. A class of Runestones were named after Hestra, found all over cyrodiil. She was also said to have an artifact, A Gown of State, which could repel spells, stave fatigue, and allow levitation. Her soul is now bound within the Amulet of Kings.

Second Empire
---
[Reman Cyrodiil I](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Reman_I), The Worldly God, Light of Man, he united all of Tamriel, except Morrowind, under his rule, and even brought the Akaviri under his knees after they discovered him to be Dragonborn, the man they were looking for all along during their invasion of Tamriel, specifically at the Battle of Pale Pass. It is said that he was the product of King Hrol and Saint Alessia, and he was buried in Sancre Tor. Pelinal Whitestrake reportedly shouted out the man's name during a duel at Sancre Tor 2,500 years before Reman I's birth.
 
[Kastav](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kastav#Kastav) took Reman I's place as emperor, and he is known to have been an "incompetent" emperor, though despite this, a fort in Skyrim's Winterhold region now bears his name.
 
[Reman Cyrodiil II](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Reman_II) took his place as emperor, and was known as a master tactician. He studied all battles that he fought in, and avoided disrupting customs and traditions of places he conquered. As a result of this and many other things, Imperial culture spread throughout Tamriel, and he was known for being an Emperor for the people. He was known to have brought an end to the Winterhold Rebellion, abolished Daedra worship and Necromancy, permitted the construction of Alduin's Wall in Sky Haven Temple, which he would later return to in order to consecrate the blood seal, and annexed Argonia during the Battle of Argonia. He died attempting to pull Morrowind into the Empire in the event known as the Four-Score War. He was buried in Sancre Tor.
 
[Brazollus Dor](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Brazollus_Dor#Brazollus_Dor) succeeded Reman II, but did very little, as he prefered to let his Potentate [Sidri-Ashak](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sidri-Ashak#Sidri-Ashak) run the empire as he himself stayed in his country estate near Skingrad, which is known to be his only wise decision, as Sidri-Ashak was an adept ruler.
 
[Reman Cyrodiil III](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Reman_III) would be the last of the Reman Dynasty. Nothing much is known of him other than he had a wife: Tavia, and a son: Juilek, as well as he fought in the Four-Score war, and was assassinated by the Morag Tong, ending the reign of the Reman Dynasty.

The Akaviri Potentate [Versidue-Shaie](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Versidue-Shaie) took the place of Emperor Reman III's after his death and the death of the Reman line. He is resonsible for having the Black Rose built upon Blackrose in Argonia, one of the Tamriel's most notorious prisons. He also passed the Guild act of 2E 321, and was later assassinated in Senchal by the Morag Tong
 
Son of Versidue-Shaie, [Savirien-Chorak](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Savirien-Chorak#Savirien-Chorak) was the next Potentate, tho the only thing known of him is he reformed local armies.

Interregnum
---
The Interregnum is a period in history when there were no legitimate rulers to the throne of Tamriel, an entire 5 centuries of bickering between small kingdoms and petty states and warlords. The first to take up the throne during the Interregnum was [Durcorach, the Black Drake](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Durcorach#Durcorach), a reachman who raised an army from the reach and took control of the Ruby Throne. His wife was Veraxia Tharn, which legitimized his rule even further. He is known to have lead his people in a bloody invasion of High rock, pillaging several cities. Durcorach was struck down during after setting his sights on Daggerfall, killed by Emeric of Cumberland's forces after they flanked Durcorach's ranks by surprise.
 
[Moricar](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moricar#Moricar) was the second to take the Ruby Throne during the Interregnum. A Reachman, he was the son of Durcorach. Though Nothing is known about his reign, it is known his child, Leovic, would take the throne in his place. [Leovic](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Leovic#Leovic) was the last Reachman to take the Ruby Throne, and married a woman by the name of Clivia Tharn, daughter of Abnur Tharn, who was High Chancellor of the Elder Council and Imperial Battlemage. It was Leovic who commissioned The Emperor's Guide to Tamriel. Leovic was known to have legalized Daedra Worship, an act that would lead to his death when Varen Aquilarios stormed the Imperial City and killed him in the Imperial Throne Room.
 
[Varen Aquilarios](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Varen_Aquilarios#Varen_Aquilarios) himself would take the throne upon killing Leovic, and then consecutively marrying Leovic's widow, Clivia Tharn. He would later lead a group known as the Five Companions in a 2 year quest to recover the Amulet of Kings, which they discovered to be in the ruins of Sancre Tor. The plan was to use the Amulet to persuade Akatosh to make Varen Dragonborn, but Mannimarco, one of the Companions, altered the ritual and triggered the Soul Burst, with Varen vanishing, his fate unknown.
 
Varen's widow, [Clivia Tharn](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Clivia_Tharn#Clivia_Tharn) would take the place of Empress Regent. As the 16th daughter of Abnur Tharn, she was a prominant member of the Tharn family. Nothing is known of her rule
 
[Attrebus](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Attrebus_(warlord)#Attrebus_.28warlord.29) is the next known ruler of the Ruby Throne during the Interregnum, and mounted a campaign to rid Cyrodiil of foreign influence by expelling the Akaviri. Nothing else is known of his rule.
 
The last ruler during the Interregnum was [Cuhlecain, Emperor Zero](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cuhlecain#Cuhlecain). A petty king of Falkreath, his general was Tiber Septim himself, both of whom would unite the Colovian Estates in under a year. He proclaimed himself emperor after attacking and capturing the Ruby Throne. Unfortunately, he was killed soon after, some say by Tiber Septim himself, who would later create the cult known as the Cult of Emperor Zero to worship and honor him. However, it is very well possible that he created the cult in an attempt to cover up what he did.

Third Empire

Full family tree of the Septim Empire can be found [here](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Septim_Dynasty)
 
[Tiber Septim](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tiber_Septim), born Hjalti Early-Beard on the island of Alcaire in High Rock, or as Talos Stormcrown in Atmora (sources differ), came to rule after the death of Emperor Cuhlecain. He is known to be the greatest of the dragonborns. At age 20, he took Old Hrol'dan back from the Reachmen alongside his captain, Cuhlecain, whom he was the general to. Soon after the battle, the Greybeards called for him. It is rumored that he killed Emperor Cuhlecain to achieve the Ruby Throne, and created the Cult of Emperor Zero as a cover up. It is known that he once consorted with Queen Barenziah, of whom Tiber forced to have a miscarriage.
 
After Tiber's death, his grandson, [Pelagius Septim I](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Pelagius_Septim#Pelagius_Septim) took over but was assassinated while praying in the Temple of the One in the Imperial City by the Dark Brotherhood. His reign was said to be as glorious as his grandfather's.
 
With no legitimate rulers to fill the Ruby Throne, as Pelagius I had no children, Tiber's niece, [Kintyra Septim](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kintyra#Kintyra) took the throne. She was the former Queen of Silvenar and her reign was blessed with prosperity and peace. She was a patroness to art, music, and dance. It is said that she had a tattoo from her neck stolen by the most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin.
 
[Uriel Septim I](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_Septim_I#Uriel_Septim_I), son of Kintyra took the throne next. He was known as a great lawmaker and promoter of independent guilds and organizations, including the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild, which increased in prominence during his reign.
 
Son of Uriel I, [Uriel Septim II](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_Septim_II#Uriel_Septim_II) took the throne, tho his rule was known to be cursed with blights and plagues. He was a tenderhearted man, which kept him from serving tamriel properly, and little justice was done under his rule.
 
Uriel II left many fanancial and judicial problems to [Pelagius Septim II](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Pelagius_Septim_II#Pelagius_Septim_II) who took rule upon his grandfather's death. He was known to have dismissed every member of the Elder Council and only allowed those who payed great sums to return.
 
Pelagius II's son, [Antiochus Septim](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Antiochus#Antiochus_Septim) took the throne next, and he was known to be very flamboyant, having many mistresses and wives. The Summerset Isles was nearly lost to the Maormer under his rule, and only after an alliance with the King of Summerset did they defeat the Maormer after a freak storm, said to have been created by the Psijic Order. His reign was rife with civil wars.
 
Antiochus' and Gysilla's daughter, [Kintyra Septim II](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kintyra_II#Kintyra_II) rose to the throne at the age of 15. She was accused of being a bastard by Queen Potema of Solitude on behalf of her son Uriel III, whom brought several disgruntled kings of High Rock, Skyrim, and Morrowind to attack the newly annointed Empress. She was taken captive and it is unknown when she died nor where and is the subject of much controversy.
 
Kintyra Septim II's cousin, [Uriel Septim III](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_Septim_III#Uriel_Septim_III), son of Potema Septim and Mantiarco, Originally named Uriel Mantiarcho, he changed his name upon ascending to the throne after his cousin's death. He was captured at the Battle of Ichidag in Hammerfell in 3E 127, where he was subsequently burned alive by a mob whilst in his carriage.
 
Uriel Septim III's uncle, [Cephorus Septim I](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cephorus_I#Cephorus_I), son of Pelagius Septim II and Quintilla Vulstaed (or Qizara), he was known as a kind and intelligent warrior, though it took him 10 years to defeat his sister Potema.
 
Cephorus Septim I and Potema Septim's brother, [Magnus Septim](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Magnus_Septim#Magnus) was known to be the King of Wayrest before ascending to the throne after the War of the Red Diamond. He was already an elderly man by time he took the throne, and his business consisted of punishing traitorous kings of the War of the Red Diamond.
 
Magnus Septim and Hellena (or Utheilla)'s son, [Pelagius Septim III](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Pelagius_Septim_III), also known as "Mad Pelagius" is accused of murdering his father Magnus to ascend to the throne, though this accusation is dismissed mainly because Pelagius hardly visited the Imperial city, and was present in Solitude during his father's death, however the accusations remain. He was known to have embaressed many dignitaries and kings, even attempting to hang himself during a grand ball. His mind slowly deteriorated until his wife, Katariah, was made Empress Regent to take over the throne. He died in an insane asylum at the age of 34 after a brief fever at the Temple of Kynareth on the Isle of Betony. His death, the 2nd of Sun's Dawn, is now hailed as Mad Pelagius Day, and a day where you can summon Sheogorath, the mad god. Heretics later known as the Apostles took the stones of the temple and rebuilt it in the Shivering Isles, and is known now as the Howling Halls, because it is said that the Mad Emperor's screams can still be heard. His pelvis was discovered in these ruins in 3E 433 and are now on display in Crucible. It is also said that his soul haunts the Pelagius Wing of the Blue Palace of Solitude.
 
Pelagius Septim III's wife, [Katariah Ra'Athim](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Katariah) is the only Dunmer to ascend the Ruby Throne. She was the Duchess of Vvardenfell and wife of Mad Pelagius III before her husband was locked away and she took his place. She had a chamption known as Nandor Beraid, who was defeated in a duel by Raphalas Eul to prove a point and win respect among the Elder Council. She was also the first to appoint an Imperial Battlemage, Jovron Direnni, the first since the days of Tiber Septim. Her fifty year or so reign is known as a happy one.
 
Katariah Ra'Athim and Pelagius Septim III's son, [Cassynder Septim](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cassynder#Cassynder) became emperor, and was already middle-aged upon his mother's death and ascending the Ruby Throne. He died after only 2 years on the throne
 
Cassynder Septim's half-brother, and son to Katariah Ra'Athim and Gallivere Lariat, [Uriel Septim IV](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_Septim_IV#Uriel_Septim_IV), born Uriel Lariat, he was King of Wayrest before ascending the Ruby Throne. Few members of the Elder Council were able to accept him as being of fully blood relation to Tiber Septim, and he and the council were at odds with eachother time and time again.
 
[Cephorus Septim II](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cephorus_II#Cephorus_II) was chosen as Emperor by the vote of the Elder Council in 3E 247 as he was a cousin more closely related to the original Septim Bloodline than Uriel IV's son, Andorak was. Andorak and Cephorus II were constantly at odds. It is known that he sent many mercenaries from Hammerfell in an attempt to stop the Camoran Usurper's army of Daedra rampaging throughout Valenwood, but theey were bribed, turned into undead, or slaughtered. Either way, the loss lead to an increase of hostility toward the Empire.
 
Cephorus Septim II's son, [http://Uriel Septim V](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_Septim_V#Uriel_Septim_V) was known to have embarked on a series of invasions of Akavir, including Roscrea, Cathnoquey, and Yneslea. His conquering was eventually however deemed a failure. He was killed in Akavir on the battlefield of Ionith. Despite these failures, he was still hailed as a military genius
 
Uriel Septim V's wife, [Thonica](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Thonica) became Empress Regent after her husband's death in Ionith, and her son was crowned Emperor at a mere age of 5. She is said to have enjoyed her time on the Ruby Throne and hesitated to give her son reign.
 
Thonica and Uriel Setpim V's son, [Uriel Septim VI](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_Septim_VI#Uriel_Septim_VI) was given the Ruby Throne when he was old enough and his mother retired from the throne when he was 22 years old. He was known to have utilized defunct spy networks and guard units to bully and coerce the more difficult members of the Elder Council. He was known to have been suspicious of the Psijic Order and would refuse ambassadors from the Isle of Artaeum into the Imperial City He died when he fell from his horse.
 
Uriel Septim VI's half-sister, [Morihatha Septim](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Morihatha) was known by diplomats as the most beautiful creature in all of Tamriel. She was known to be a well-learned and expert politician. She was known to have been suspicious of the Psijic Order and would refuse ambassadors from the Isle of Artaeum into the Imperial City, just like her half-brother before her. She would later commission the Second Edition of the Pocket Guide to the Empire. It is said she was killed by an assassin hired by Thoricles Romus, an argonian angered that she would not send troops to his troubled lands. He was tried and executed.
 
Morihatha Septim's nephew, [Pelagius Septim IV](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Pelagius_Septim_IV#Pelagius_Septim_IV) was crowned emperor after his aunt's death. He was known to be patient and deliberate in his endeavors, but did not have his aunt's success. However, the Empire was stable and prosperous, and closer to unity than it had ever been since the days of Uriel I. He, like his aunt, was suspicious of the Psijic Order. He invested heavily in the infrastructure of his Empire.
 
Pelagius Septim IV's son, [Uriel Septim VII](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_Septim_VII) was known to be very promiscuous, having many children. With Empress Caula Voria, he had Geldall, Enman, and Ebel, a bastard son named Calaxes whom was given Archbishopric of the Temple of the One, but was assassinated for trying to establish a theocracy, and another bastard son by the name of Martin Septim, with a woman named Gemile. Uriel VII is renowned as one of the greatest emperors in history, having reigned the Empire for 65 years. He was eventually betrayed by his battlemage, Jagar Tharn in 3E 389, who imprisoned him in Oblivion until the Eternal Champion defeated the battlemage. Jagar had impersonated the emperor for 10 years, an event known as the Imperial Simulacrum. On the 27th of Last Seed, 3E 433, Uriel VII and his sons (except Martin) were all assassinated by the Mythic Dawn.
 
Uriel Septim VII and Gemile's son, [Martin Septim](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Martin_Septim) was brought up in Kvatch and knew nothing of his heritage to the throne until the Oblivion Crisis struck and he was given the Amulet of Kings by the Champion of Cyrodiil. He was known in the past for worshipping Sanguine, and even claimed the Sanguine Rose for a time, before discovering Akatosh and worshipping him in the Temple of Akatosh in Kvatch as a priest. He was forced to sacrifice himself, and the Amulet of Kings, and became an Avatar of Akatosh and banished Mehrunes Dagon back into Oblivion from Mundus after Dagon had invaded the Imperial City. He is now known as a savior of Tamriel, as short as his reign might have been.

[Ocato of Firsthold](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ocato_of_Firsthold) was appointed Imperial Battlemage after Jagar's betrayal. He would become the new Potentate after Martin Septim's death. He was known to be on the verge of successfully re-stabilizing the Empire before he was assassinated, likely by the Thalmor.
 
[Thules the Gibbering](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Thules_the_Gibbering#Thules_the_Gibbering) took the seat of Potentate after Ocato's death. Thules was a Nibenese witch-warrior and was favored by the Elder Council over Titus Mede I, a colovian warlord who would indeed become emperor after Thules' death.

After Thules' the Gibbering's death, his Rival, [Titus Mede I](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Titus_Mede#Titus_Mede) became emperor. He was known to be a Colovian warlord and a soldier in an outlaw army. He captured the Imperial Throne with less then 1,000 men and seized control of the dying empire. He is now thought of as a liberator rather than a conqueror.
 
Son of Titus Mede I, [Attrebus mede](http://uesp.net/wiki/Books:Prince_Attrebus_Mede) became Emperor after his father's death. Much is known of him, far too much to be in this small guide to the Emperor's of Tamriel.
 
[Titus Mede II](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Titus_Mede_II#Titus_Mede_II) would later eventually be crowned emperor, and then subsequently assassinated, supposedly by the Dark Brotherhood aboard his ship, the Katariah, in 4E 201.
