Child of Yokuda,

Remember Ghanzok'li, the lion of Akos Kasaz. He who slew three hundred Lefthanded Elves at the gates of Orichalc Tower, and defeated their warlord Ulmorion El-Mafariin. He who was the very last to succumb to the power of the Orichalc Stone. Remember Ghanzok'Li, remember Akos Kasaz.

Child of Yokuda,

Remember Yaqqa-Afala, the snake of Samara. She who closed the Aetherial rift in Hnakka'kotha. She who drove back the cult of Sataklonik from our lands. Not by strength, but through cleverness. Remember Yaqqa-Afala, remember Samara.

Child of Yokuda,

Remember Ansei Hamaram, the bull of Kanesh. He who with his bare hands built the great bridge of Laksook Masaram between Kanesh and Bini-Nasona. He who built Emperor Ghanan'jad's personal ship. Remember Ansei Hamaram, remember Kanesh.

Child of Yokuda,

Remember Vashana'ji, the eagle of Yath. She who saw the invading fleet of the Mala-Ghartor clan three months before it landed on the shores near Kan'Bohka. She who put arrows in the throat of every elven warrior during the battle of Sa-Mokbha. Remember Vashana'ji, remember Yokuda.

Child of Yokuda,

Remember the long-dead heroes of our lost land. Remember our home, al-Yokuda.
