*By Gharythai-Tuul, wise woman of the Goria tribe*

These were the words that were spoken by Aspera, messenger of Boethiah, to the Chimer of Dwemereth in the early Merethic Era. They were the words spoken also by the dead ADA at Convention, and they are ever repeated in the heart of NIRN, they are the music of the Wheel and the longing song of AETHERIUS. They are what the Dwemer repeated one too many times. They ARE.

The words of ADA-MANTIA are **XM PGT OHC MSJ**, and their meaning is the eternal number.

The words of the Red Mountain are **UFW YWQ AV XPT**, and their meaning is the beat of the Heart.

The words of Crystal-Like-Law are **VA DGP MX**, and their meaning is the reflection of light.

The words of White-Gold are **VA DQW XF**, and their meaning is the beauty of the stars.

The word of Snow Throat are **MONCBTV**, and its meaning is the combination of all light.

The word of Orichalc is **KLMIBGE**, and its meaning is what all water flows from.

The word of Green-Sap is **ABICDIA**, and its meaning is the current now.

The word of the secret Tower(s) is **CDEYVUO**, and its meaning is the inverse of all things.

The word of Walk-Brass **IS NOT**, for unlike all other Towers Walk-Brass **IS NOT**.

Speak these words, child of LKHAN, and BECOME Zero.

**AE GORIA MUNDEX ADA LORCYRI GHARTOK AH AURBIS**
