...and Mauloch, scion of Malacath, picked up the Glushor and spoke to the Orcs. "Follow me to the Osh Voshim, and taste the grudge of Mala-Cath." And the devout Orcs of Zugktum heeded his words. They marched with Mauloch on the harbour of Tar Dwynntwyll, and captured the ship of Lattanion Veloth-Lover. Gahthrion the Rakhnorgimin took command of the vessel and steered the ship towards Osh Voshim after the instructions of Mauloch, who saw with the eyes of Malacath himself. He became...

...walked from the shores of Yal Ornim. Where they had landed Mauloch and his followers built the stronghold of Morkul, and there they wept ten days in memory of the deceased. Malacath felt the sorrow of his followers, and he felt grudge toward the sea that had caused it. Mauloch...

...so Malacath drank the sea, and created the Tumnosh. Mauloch and his followers settled the new land. And on the first day of spring during the thirtieth last year of the Dawn Era Mauloch and his priests sacrificed five bears and fiveteen Echatere to Malacath. Malacath was pleased with this gift, and created the Horker for the true Orcs of Wrothgar to feed on forevermore as...

One day Mauloch walked to the shrine of Fharun, without any of his followers. He locked himself within the Sanctuary of Sacred Words, and sat down before the Statue of Malacath. No one dared to enter the Sanctuary for many years, for chief Mauloch had told them not to. When seven years had passed a priest of Malacath by the name of Yorgumh gro-Fharun, entered the sanctuary. When he came to the shrine he saw Mauloch lying dead and blindfolded before Malacath's Statue. But Yorgumh was not saddened by this, because he knew that Malacath had taken Mauloch's soul to his realm. On the Altar of Grudge lay a vellum scroll, which pulsated with a power like that of the Agra Krazak itself. He took the scroll, and received a vision of Mauloch, praying by the Ashen Anvil in the Ashen Forge. Yorgumh knew what he had to do, and sat down before the Statue of Malacath. In that moment he took on the mantle of the Keeper, and began the Cycle of Jug Tumn Mauloch.
