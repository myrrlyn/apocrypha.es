Do not cry, my child,

For your suffering will end soon.

Your home will no longer be wild,

And you will again dance under the moons.

&amp;nbsp;

We did not escape the rumbling land, 

And we did not gain any godly grace.

But know that you will be in good hands. 

And be under the kindly eyes of Arkayâ€™s face. 

- Remus Catullus
