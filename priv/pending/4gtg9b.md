*The original text was written in (Kynokhi-Axadni) Jel, in 3E 430, by Xathok of Dacynne, Black Marsh (now known as Dakyn, Axadniha Province, Argonia). It was translated into Cyrodilic and Dunmeris in 4E 14 on request of Xathok by language scholar Eno Sarethi of Narsis.*

The study of Ayleid ruins, although it may seem to be completely the domain of mages and historians, can sometimes yield some results that are rather practical in this era and do not involve novel ways to magically transmute leaves to mushrooms and back again. This is one such occasion.

At first glance, the Ayleid ruins scattered around what is now known as Cyrodiil appear to be randomly distributed. One is as likely to encounter one when travelling around the Gold Coast as near Lake Rumare, in the West Weald or in the foothills of the Jeralls. However, one pattern does emerge. Study a map of Ayleid ruins in the south-east of Cyrodiil and it becomes clearly visible. The most obvious trace of this is the positioning of the ruins of Arpenia, Atatar, Welke, and Wendelbek. There are no ruins south or east of any of these. Could these be the most extreme outposts of Ayleid civilisation?

Now, consider Veyond. Admittedly, it is not in the same diagonal as the four ruins mentioned above. However, it is approximately the same distance from the Gold Road as Arpenia and Atatar are, implying that the ruin line bends south roughly in the same line as the Gold Road does now. The Gold Road is in that position for a reason. The lands east of the Gold Road, and in particular those east of the Ayleid ruin line, are forest and swamp, a milder version of western Argonia. The lands *west* of the Gold Road, however, are far more hospitable to man and mer, making the Gold Road area a natural border between two lands. One other piece of evidence worth mentioning is that Veyond has almost fully intact high walls, making it possibly the most fortified Ayleid site in Cyrodiil.

On the basis of this information, I can conclude that Arpenia, Atatar, Welke, Wendelbek, and Veyond were border towns for the Ayleids, with the possible exception of Wendelbek as it is north of the Panther River and could theoretically have served as some sort of trading town. The question of motive then arises. Who would settle on the eastern side of the Ayleid line to the extent that the Ayleids had to build border towns?

Is the answer not obvious? This is very strong evidence, some would say proof, that Saxhleel territory once extended further west than it currently does. And one day we shall reclaim it. We have history on our side, and the Cyrodiils have no reason other than their stubborn pride not to let us reclaim the Blackwood. We will no longer have to abide by arbitrary lines drawn through the swamp to separate Blackwood and Seydahnil. For that matter, soon we will be free to call it Seydahnil instead of Murkmire.

Let us advance to the Panther, and to the Gold Road, and so unify Argonia once more!
