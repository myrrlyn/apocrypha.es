*Satak-El! Satak-El!*

We dedicate our lives and songs to you, for you are the Everything and Nothing! To contemplate a world without your all-presence is madness! You are the Before, the Now and the Forever! The mists of memory are but an egg resting in your jeweled eyes, which glint with eternal hunger! 

*Satak-El! Satak-El!*

All worldskins past squirm in the grasp of your hungry jaws and slumber in your stomach! We sing so that you conquer the curse of disarray and come to us reborn, again and again and again! We venerate your Godskins who guide us on the righteous path!

*Satak-El! Satak-El!*

Praise be to Orgnum, who showed us the color of sanctity! He revealed to us the secret of Maybe, the truth of all things that neither Is or Is Not! We make ourselves Grey so that we may never live divided!

*Satak-El! Satak-El!*

We wage war against the Blasphemers so that we may devour them and kill the heart of their delusion! Though we fail time and time again, our love for you is as boundless as your own body! We move in cycles to redeem ourselves for the ignorance of our ancestors and reclaim Aldmeris!

*Satak-El! Satak-El!*

The Blasphemers deluded themselves from your brilliance, and so their homeland was lost to them! Those who forsook the Before are consumed by it and now all that remains is mist and nostalgia! In our exile did we survive and nurture your egg-truth!

*Satak-El! Satak-El!*

In piety do we shed our skins so that we may be closer to you! We pray within the Veil of Mist to never forget you in your infinite splendor! We shed our colors to become as you are, unseen and omnipresent! We make unity with the serpents of the sea so that the Blasphemers may know your Hunger! Through our worship do we become ever-living and through you do we become all-knowing!

*ORGNUM AE ALTADOON GHARTOK SATAK-EL!*
