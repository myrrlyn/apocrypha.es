Torinaan, oh Torinaan. Temple of et'Ada.

Greatly outshining the foul shrine of Malada.

Whose pillars rise into the sky and bask in the light of Magnus.

Magnus' light grants magicka to us and only us.

Built once by the stonemasons from long-lost Aldmeris.

Now standing there, tall and proud as the center of the Aurbis.

In the northeast stand the shrines of Mara and Stendarr.

Mara, god of love and lover of all Elven, and Stendarr the merciful, who shines bright like a star.

In the southeast stand the the shrines of Magnus and Syrabane.

Magnus the great magic-light and Syrabane who keeps all meri sane.

In the southwest stand the shrines of Anu and Y'ffre.

Everything in within the Dream is Anu's domain. Y'ffre has to make do with what one currently can see.

I the northwest stand the shrines of Trinimac and Xarxes.

The warrior god, now twisted and foul, and the godly scribe that now is almost wife-less.

In the center lies a great power, not to be outspoken.

But I can tell you that it is a relic from old Wansalen.

And whispers in the night say things like *AE BALA MERI AH MNEM AV NEN*
