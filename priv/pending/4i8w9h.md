*[First to Grace eyes [1st Post]: is’t faire, my deares? Composed whilst trippin’ the light fantastic in the “cosmic-world”* [hint, hint] *&amp; I’ve got to ask- Tamriel- was’t she my Muse to convey the opiate spore, or mine angel-owne, my summon’d* ost, *with a Dagóthi thermos serpent-poison fill’d I drank for mithridate ’gainst ghost-touch of hours?
