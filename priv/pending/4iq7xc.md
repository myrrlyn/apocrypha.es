From “The Secret Writings of Ra’zhiin”

Librarian’s Note:  In the wake of the Creatia Wars a number of texts have emerged that are of uncertain, or unconfirmable, provenance; the following is one such text.  Though the author claims to be Ra’zhiin – the Prophet of Azura and disgraced Prophet of the Temple – the Prophet himself claims no knowledge of the text.  Luminocentric voyance suggests composition in the late 10th Era (four eras in the future!) which would place its writing during the Prophet’s traversal of the Dark.  Some Imperial theologians suggest this is the work of a Ra’zhiin from another Stream, but a more mundane explanation remains:  the Prophet does not want to associate himself with this writing for unknown reasons.

Lady of Dawn.  You are the first to see the pale fire of a New Day – not its corruptor (Sithis) nor one to protect it (Anu), but One Who Knows.  The Hours of Dark and Light are Yours.  The chronocules of Death and Birth are Yours.  You are Shadow in the unknowable abysses between them.  You hear the songs of the Moon Paladins.

Mother of the Rose.  You are the Beauty Who Stings, the Scent That Bleeds, Love That Rends.  Pain and Transcendence.  The Moment of Convergence, of Possibility.

In Your hands:  The Moon and Star.  The Twins Who Protect and the God Who Fled.  You are…
