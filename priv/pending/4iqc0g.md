*The following is a series of funerary poems imported from Kamal and added to the Reman Heritage Archives circa 2E 600 and penned in the year 2E 572, shortly after the Second Akaviri Invasion. This is one of the most intact and carefully translated Akaviri materials in the Archives, which we are proud to store in our humble halls. What few insights we scholars may gain into the nation of Kamal are a boon to the pursuits of academia and history.*

Black Kinging Stones

Singing to frozen marshals

Memory is a lattice

***

Songs of history

Remind us of our heritage

Old snows unforgotten

***

The First Shores

Waters caresses the ice

Pilgrimage from the North

***

Pilgrim scribes arrive here

And cleanse their minds in the surf

Our memories are made pure

***

We journey cold and numb

To distant Nunmun Gate

A door of watchful eyes

***

Twin tablets stand tall

Wooden and lacquered

The crevice lies beyond

***

A shrine with water basin

Pour out all imperfection

Foul memories boil

***

Repeat at valley’s end

Pilgrim attains the Water State

An honest face makes no ripples

***

The Water State is still

Write names only in truth

Let no song be dishonest

***

Pillars atop the glacier

They whisper to the sky

Summit of the world

***

Chisel and hammer in hand

Memories are written here

Stones sing to the distant home

***

Bravest Lord-Marshall

Nobly sought the ordained one

We followed you to war

***

Foe to the Face-Snaked Queen

Traitor Aspect and matron of vipers

Gold stings like the sun's venom

***

Eater of the Ashen King

Whose voice rips apart the sky

Atmora honors Ada’Soom

***

The words remain forever

You legacy is pure as snow

Crystalline and eternal

***

Pilgrim scribes retire

And return with great honor

The Solstice Convent begins

***

Longest night of Winter

We tie ourselves to family and king

Summer’s peak awaits
