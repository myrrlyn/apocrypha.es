*By Fuldhorn Wrong-Thinker of the College of Winterhold*

Many modern Nords see the Giants as uncivilized and brutish. They see them as mere beasts! Have they forgotten that the Giants are our ancestors? That it was those Wandering Ones that fell upon the Throat of the World down from the Mother Kjune's very lap? That they were the original lords of Atmora, and those who drew the Old Ones from it? That they are the fathers and mothers of all Nords? Well I shall remind you of the ancient faith of the Giants, the ancient faith of the Atmorans. And I will make sure that you remember your true ways!

**The Gods of the Elder Wood:**

**Skoor**, the "Stone-Tooth".

The Giantish god of death and war. He is who during Untime drove the Old Ones from Alt-Mora, but was killed by the Elven god-king Ahrighehl soon after. He is also the one who brings the souls of dead Giants to his realm of Lhorkag, the "Cold Rock". They are then judged after how many of the Elvenkind they have slain in life. The more Elves killed, the happier afterlife you get.

**Kjune**, the "Wind Godess".

The widow of Shor, and godess of the air and religion (yes, our ancestors did very much need such a god). She is who taught the early Giants to speak, and made their voices far mightier than than those of the Old Ones.

**Mara**, the "Granting God".

Mara is the daughter (or son) of the obscure Giantish god "Akka", and is depictied as either male or female. In some rare cases both. He/She is the godess of fertility, and both the Mundus and Nirn is to have been the result of his/her unholy relationship with the already wed Shor.

**Jhuun Al**, the "Thinking God".

Jhuun Al, sometimes called Jhuunal, is the Giantish god of magic. He was the advisor to Skoor during Untime, but has since lost his purpose. He is said to have tricked the Elven warlord Falghariil into telling the Giants the secrets of Magicka.

**Herma Mora**, the "Trickster God".

Herma Mora is to have helped both sides during the war between the Wandering and Old ones, but also often tricked both sides into making fatal mistakes. He therefore earned the title of Trickster God in the pantheon. He is sometimes said to have been involved in the death of Skoor.

**Aspera**, the "Cunning Godess"

Not much is known of Aspera, but she is frequently mentioned in both Giantish and Velothi prayers. She is to the Velothi closely related to the Daedric Prince Boethiah. To the Giants she was the godess of murder and lies, but almost nothing else is known of her.

Remember these gods, Nords! For they are who you should pray to!
