Welp, the time is nigh for the **Heretical Headcanons**, and I've been on a bit of an Ayleid kick recently (though there are those who would state that I am *always* on an Ayleid kick.

Today I shall discuss Umaril the Unfeathered, the half-Ayleid whose mother was Ayleid and father was "divine".

Okay, so what exactly does this mean?

There are some that believe Umaril to be the spawn of Aka in some gigantic cosmic joke.  That theory has a good bit of merit, but I'll up the ante, so to speak.

What if, and bear with me here, the "Father" of Umaril is. . .

*wait for it*. . .

Meridia.

Okay okay, I know what you're thinking:

'*ugh, Nagaialor, not Meridia AGAIN, you just talked about her in your last theory post!*'

That is true, I did.  It matters not.

Meridia is many things: et'Ada, Magna-Ge, the Wayward Solar Daughter, the Glister Witch, Daedric Prince of Light, and oft worshiped by certain Ayleidoon kingdoms as the embodiment of Light. (even though there's a perfectly good *Magnus* that rises and sets every single day)  *cough* Nenalata *cough*  (I mean, come *on*, the name literally means Water Light and good old Laloriaran seemed rather fond of her)

Anyways, before I ramble ad nauseum, you're probably thinking "hey Nagaialor, these Daedric Princes can't have children.  They can't create!"

Oh my sweet Wenayasille kynd.

Meridia is not just any old Daedric Prince.  She was one of the Magna-Ge that fled to Aetherius with Magnus, Mnemoli, and others too numerable to name.  She just had that whole little bit about being cast out of Aetherius, and there was something about a rainbow road that helps her warp time too, but that doesn't really matter here.

What matters is that Meridia cares for mortals.  It just so happens that the Ayleids were the ones that received a fair share of her care.  So much so, that when their "Empire" (loosely collected kingdom-states) was threatened by the Paravant, she gave them a Champion.

Umaril.

There's a good bit of Luciferian symbolism behind Meridia:

* Bright Star, beautiful beyond measure

* Cast out of the heavens for some betrayal

* Made a home for herself in the hellscapes (out of Magnus's own light, no less!)

* Some depictions of Meridia have wings (like the statue of Meridia on Mount Kilkreath)

Where am I going with that tangent?  Well, keeping with that bit of theological goodness, having a son born from the divine would be 'on the nose' for such religious parallels, wouldn't it?  

What better a champion for her treasured mortals than one of her own making that could reform in the waters of Oblivion and come back in due time (I promise Umaril is not Jesus.)

Also, Meridia is not bound by your mortal conceptions of 'gender'; it's totally probable for her to come in whatever form she would wish to -- well, procreate.  

How she would go about creating without giving a part of herself is honestly beyond me, unless she did give a part of herself in the making of Umaril, just not her immortality.

As always, thoughts, concerns, postulations, expansions, disagreements are all welcome.  This one reads a bit like a ramble because it **is** a ramble; I just have to get all my thoughts in organization is all.
