From the *Encyclopedia Ayleidoone: Ayleidoon and its Etymologies* by Alexandre Provanc of Jehanna

**On the Subject of Light**

The Ayleidoon had at least two words that meant light:

*Alata* and *Latta*

Many scholars would tell you that this difference is minuscule and that the words can be used interchangeably in any Ayleidoon conversation.  

I disagree completely.

The Ayleidoon peoples (not to be confused with the Ayleidoon language since these phrases *are* used interchangeably) held light in high regards, many of their city-states giving praises to a pantheon known as "The Nine Coruscations": nine of the brightest stars in the nighttime sky.  Since the Ayleidoon valued starlight as the most sacred and holy of light, this makes sense.  As such, they would likely have devised a linguistic mean to differentiate between "holy" light and "mundane" light, hence the words *Alata* and *Latta*

Consider the following word *Alasil*, meaning vision. Scholars have noted that the Ayleidoon people quite enjoyed taking words and compounding them to make other words: Adabal comes from Ada (God) and Bal (stone), Malada comes from Mal[a] (High;likely taken from Malatu meaning Truth) and Ada (again, God), Welkynd comes from Welke (Sky) and Kynd (child), and so on  and so forth.  Those of learning understand that the -sil of *Alasil* likely comes from the word *Sila*, meaning "shines".  An -a suffix lends itself to plurals, so taking this away leaves us with the word *Sil*, or "shine".  Since *Alasil* as a whole means "Vision" and *Sil* means "shine", then the *Ala* is likely to mean "eyes" to make "eye-shine".  

That helps explain the *Ala* of *Alata*, but what of the *Ta*?  Scholars from Firsthold to Gwylim are not entirely sure, but we must look to the word *Tam-Rielle* for a partial answer.  Even the common folk know that Tamriel comes from words meaning "Dawn's Beauty", and *Tam-Rielle* are such words.  *Rielle* is the Ayleidoon word for Beauty, and *Tam* is the word for Dawn (not the dawn that rises with Magnus, but the Dawn Era where the gods walked the world).  Sometimes, when the pronunciation of a compound would be muddled, consonants and vowels (See Malada) would be dropped.  Ala-ta(m) can be taken to mean literally "Eyes of Dawn" or "**Dawn Light**".

While a case could be made where Latta is similar (one scholar of Alinor once proposed it to mean Dawn of Time.  How erroneous!), the most likely means of its origin is a corruption of the word *Lattia* (another word meaning 'shines'.) during one of the shifts in Ayleidoon linguistic patterns between the Late Merethic Era and the founding of the Camoran Dynasty.  *Alata* seems to have been an established word, it appearing frequently in transcriptions in the walls in ruins under Cyrodiil City, one of the earliest Ayleid ruins on all Tamriel: *Latta* is apparently absent, but *Lattia* is not.  *Latta* is however present in carvings on the walls of the ruins of Bisnensel, one of the youngest Ayleid ruins in the land, thought to be built sometime in the 1E400s.

These are normally intuitive leaps that scholars should not make, but our lack of knowledge into the Ayleidoon as a people and culture force  me to make some such leaps.  *Latta* is most like to simply mean 'shine', or better 'shimmer', a mere glimmer in comparison to the Light of the Dawn: Magnus and his Ge.

Maybe once more money is poured into the excavation or maybe even restoration of a couple of these glorious ruins chock full of history and potential cultural findings, answers may well 'come to the light'.
