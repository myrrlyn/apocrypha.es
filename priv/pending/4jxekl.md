This one knows that we do not talk of the Darkness behind the world, but this one also knows that we must face what pains our people. To face what makes us suffer we must understand it.

It is true that all the Khaj must face the pull of the bent dance, but where does it truly come from? Khajiit will reveal the truth behind this secret, for it is riddled with obscurity and often overlooked. This one will tell you the reality behind Lorkhaj and the taint of the Great Darkness for it must be told.

The Great Darkness of Namiira, from the place behind the world - hiding unnoticed by all but Nirni's defenders. Why is it that so many ignore this threat, the darkened corpse of Lorkhaj? It is because it repulses them, for what festers within shakes them to the core. It is repulsion given form, the third moon's parasite. This one knows that the corpse of Lorkhaj rots away eternally, and that it's rotting affects all from the heart of the world.

To Khajiit it is the great darkness, but the tail-less may call it by another name: The scuttling void.

The clan mothers speak of how Lorkhaj was filled with a great darkness upon his birth, and in that moment Namiira was within him. what they will not tell you is that Namiira is in all that he touched. When Lorkhaj made a home for Nirni's children it would surely come to rot, for she is the one to decay all things. Unnoticed and gradual she takes strength from ignorance, her claws digging deeper from within the heart of Nirni. But she never pounces, for to pounce is to reveal one's intentions.

So instead she rots the world from behind it, and only the Khajiit can see it. She is the one who brings an end to all things, from her "Scuttling void" that fills the corpse of her tool. It wriggles and winds around the flesh, consumes and leaves only itself in it's wake. They are correct in one way, this one knows that it scuttles - but they do not know why. She is the one who rots the minds of good cats and turns them bent, who destroys the light in endless dark. Her children are those she corrupts and they are many - even the strongest of Moon Paladins struggle to resist the bent dance.

This is what we must defend the world from, the scuttling void, the dark moon, the corspe of Lorkhaj. All that lie under Jone and jode, just behind the world.

And within it.
