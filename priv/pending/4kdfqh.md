Here is the annual list of independent nations of Tamriel for the year of 2E 583. I have personally seen an increased confusion concerning this matter in the last year, even among members of the University; so I beleive that this list is much needed.

________________________________

#Northern Tamriel

**The Daggerfall Covenant:**

Consists of the partially independent kingdoms and duchies of Daggerfall, Camlorn, Alcaire, Wayrest, Shornhelm, Northpoint, Evermore, Sentinel and Orsinuim. Although Orsinium's membership is debated. It is ruled by High King Emeric of Cumberland and his consort Queen Maraya of Sentinel from its capital of Wayrest.

**The Reach:**

Consists of the once holds of The Reach and Haafingar, although the latter's inclusion is fiercely debated. It is ruled from Markarth by a Reachman king.

**Western Skyrim:**

Western Skyrim consists of the holds of Hjaalmarch, The Pale, Falkreath and Whiterun. Its official capital is Solitude, but due to the Reachmen having captured most of Haafingar the king of Western Skyrim rules from elsewhere.

**The Ebonheart Pact:**

The Ebonheart Pact includes the holds of Winterhold, Eastmarch, The Rift, aswell as the areas controlled by the Dunmeri Great Houses of Hlaalu, Dres, Indoril and Redoran. It also includes parts of the Tribunal Temple's holding in mainland Morrowind and parts of northern Black Marsh. It is ruled from Windhelm by Skald-King Jorunn, but its official capital is Mournhold.

**House Telvanni Holdings:**

House Telvanni has several holdings in northeastern Morrowind, most notably the Telvanni peninsula. Vvardenfell and Solstheim are not considered nations, although they are independent from all other Tamrielic nations. Parts of Vvardenfell are however officially considered to be the Tribunal Temple's territory.

#Central Tamriel

**Hammerfell:**

Hammerfell is currently split into several partially independent city-states. While the kingdom of Sentinel has joined the Daggerfall Covenant most of Hammerfell is divided into small nations with ever-shifting borders.

**Cyrodiil:**

Cyrodiil is like Hammerfell split into several city-states and nations, whose rulers all claim to govern fully independent nations. The Elder Council does however still consider Cyrodiil to be united, although the Council has not convened after the Imperial City was taken by Daedra.

#Southern Tamriel

**The Aldmeri Dominion:**

The Aldmeri Dominion consists of the once provinces of Summerset Isles, Valenwood and Elsweyr. It is ruled from Alinor by Queen Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri, although the Dominion's capital is Elden Root in Grahtwood.

**Black Marsh:**

Most Black Marsh lacks any kind of central government, although parts of it has joined the Ebonheart Pact. The Univerisity currently has very little insight concerning Black Marsh's current politics.

____________________________________________

There are of course other self-proclaimed nations not included in this list. Most notably the aforementioned Solstheim, parts of Morrowind aswell as northern and central Vvardenfell. Along with a few others. These will be included in next year's list if they manage to remain independent for that long.
