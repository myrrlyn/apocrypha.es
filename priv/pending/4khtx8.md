So, if you have played ESO (sorry for those of you that haven't, but keep reading), you might have noticed something strange in the apperance of the Dunmer. While in the previous games they had only been depicted with red eyes, ESO does something that might be seen as heretical to Dunmer fans, [allow Dunmer to have blue eyes](http://i288.photobucket.com/albums/ll169/Farseer11/DunmerEyeColor_zps346a3828.png). This is something that has bugged me since the beginning, and even two years after the release of ESO, it still feels a bit off to me that they just gave Dunmer blue eyes without any explanation, so I'll try to give it my own explanation based on some of my recent findings.

It is common to associate the Dunmer's grey skin with their homeland's vast ashlands, due to the constant ash spewing from its active volcanos, but there is no blue ash, while Dunmer skin tends to be more blue-ish than monochrome. The answer to why is given on the Lessons of Vivec, more specifically in [Sermon 10](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-ten), when Boethiah says to his followers "Shift ye in your skin, I say to the Trinimac-eaters. Pitch your voices into the color of bruise.". Bruise, the Dunmer skin is the color of bruise, not ash. It honors their past, wearing the bruises of their history of constant strife, with the Nords, with the argonians, with themselves int he form of House Dagoth (and House Dwemer, to some of you heretics).

But why bring up their skin, you may ask. Well, because it's also believed that the Dunmer eyes are red in association with blood, with their violent nature which tends to spill their enemies and their own. But I believe there can be another interpretation, one which might be backed by the own Sermon that mention the skin of the color of bruise. In the paragraph that antecedes the previous quote from Sermon 10, I found something that attracted my attention. "A short season of towers, a rundown absolution, and what is this, what is this but fire under your eyelid?". Now, I won't pretend that I actually know the meaning of half of the things in that sentence, if you want a proper analysis on the Lessons of Vivec, you should visit the [New Whirling School](http://www.newwhirlingschool.com/index.html), but I want you to focus on the last part, "fire under your eyelid?".

Fire. Fire has a deeper conenction with the Dunmer than just blood. I won't get too much into it, but if you want to read more about it I recommend [The Fire of Vivec](http://www.newwhirlingschool.com/essays/fireofvivec.php). But if we assume, just for a second, that the Dunmer eyes have the color of fire, instead of blood, it makes perfect sense for them to have blue eyes and much as red eyes, as blue fire is still fire. Vivec is even sometimes depicted with a blue flame emanating from his bald head, the most famous of which (and my favorite) being [Ksenia Mamaeva's Vivec](http://aurbis.c0da.es/c0da/s/ksenia/vehk_v2.png).

TL;DR: Dunmer with blue eyes in ESO are not only canon, but are actually more important than the ones with red eyes and it's backed by the Lessons of Vivec, which predate ESO.

Sorry if it felt too contrived at some parts, this is the first time I try to write something more extensive in English and it isn't my first language. It's also currently 5:55am here but I had to get it out of my system before sleep otherwise I might've forgotten about it when I wake up.

This is my first serious submission to teslore that isn't a data mined text, so be easy on the newbie here. :&lt;
