Just a quick something to get myself out of my writing funk; a few common Nibenese recipes involving noodles. Again, this takes place in my AU, so obviously people have stoves and what not. I apologize if any of the measurements seem off, I'm frankly a novice to cooking.

**Noodles: A Simple Comfort Dish**

*All Cyrods, no matter creed, race, or origins, have a liking for pasta, thanks to the ever-present influence of the Nibenese. The collective conscious of the Cyrods takes solace in the memory of coming through the door to their home, finding their mother prepping up a steaming hot bowl of noodles. I, with a Dunmeri father and a Nibenese mother, have fond memories of purple, transparent Nibenese-style noodles made from saltrice, served with poached kwama egg and pickled cattail. The following staple recipes, along with one or two treasured family recipes, are sure to please!*

**Simple Quick Noodles**

* 2 Bretic shallots, thinly sliced
* 3 tbsp Nibenese sweet soy sauce (adjust to taste)
* 3 tbsp tomato catsup
* 3 tsp sesame oil
* 500 g instant noodles, preferably ‘Teapot’ brand OR 500 g fresh Nibenese wheat noodles
* 3 tbsp cooking oil
*2 litres water

*Overwhelmingly simple yet loved by all, this dish is perhaps universal in not only Cyrodiil, but in the other provinces, as well. Not too oily, although certainly not the healthiest of dishes, this is perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or fast lunch.*

Thinly slice the shallots, and pat down to absorb extra moisture. In a wok over a medium flame, fry the shallots and cooking oil till they begin to sizzle, in which by then lower the flame to low and fry till golden brown, around around 5 minutes. Once in the state as described, remove from the wok and set aside to cool. In a separate bowl, combine the sesame oil, tomato catsup, and soy sauce till mixed well. Cook the noodles in the boiling water, if instant to the package directions, and if fresh until heated through. Once cooked, toss the noodles with the sauce, and top with the shallots. If you choose, you can add a fried egg and vegetables of your choice.

**Nibenese Rice Noodles with Prawns**

* Niben Prawns, peeled, deveined, heads and shells reserved
* 500 g dried Nibenese wheat noodles (preferably Somen)
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 celery stalk, cut into 1 cm dice
* 1 small carrot, peeled, cut into 1 cm dice
* 2–3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 2 large brown onions, cut into 1 cm dice
* 2 litres water
* 2 tsp annatto seeds
* 60 g cornstarch, mixed with 60 ml (¼ cup) water
* 300 g whole baby squid, cleaned, cut into rings and tentacles
* 600 g mussels, steamed open, meat removed
* 8 eggs, boiled for 5 minutes, refreshed in iced water, peeled and quartered
* 5 spring onions, finely sliced
* 8 sunfruits, halved
* 300 g pork cracklings
* 200 g smoked Corbolo river mullet, skin and bones removed
* 1 tbsp cooking oil
* 2–3 garlic cloves, finely chopped

*This recipe, while somewhat complicated, combines the quintessential flavours of the Nibenay in one succulent stir-fried seafood and noodle dish. Here, the addition of crisp fried pork skin, or crackling, adds a wonderful flavour and texture.*

To make the sauce, preheat the oven to 220°C. Place the reserved prawn heads and shells on a baking tray and roast for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, soak the noodles in cold water for 5 minutes, then cook in boiling water for 5 minutes. Drain, refresh under cold running water and set aside.

Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a small heavy-based saucepan over a high flame. Add the celery, carrot and half each of the garlic and onion, and sauté for 5–6 minutes, or until translucent. Add the roasted prawn heads and shells, lightly crushing them to release extra flavour. Add the water and simmer for 20 minutes. Add the annatto seeds and simmer for another 10 minutes. Strain the stock, discarding solids, into a clean pan over a medium flame. Whisk in the cornstarch mixture and simmer for 1 minute, or until slightly thickened. Remove from the stovetop. To make the crackling crumbs, crush the crackling via hand, or blender and process them until they resemble coarse breadcrumbs. Transfer to a bowl, then repeat with the smoked mullet.

Heat the oil in a frying pan over a high flame. Cook the garlic and onion for 5–6 minutes, or until soft and translucent, then add the crumbed crackling and mullet. Reduce flame to medium and stir for 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside to cool. Heat a wok over high heat until hot, then add the remaining 1 tbsp of oil. When very hot, add the squid and prawns and toss until just opaque. Add the mussels and cook for another 30 seconds. Remove from the wok and set aside.

Add the blanched noodles and 60 ml (¼ cup) of the sauce to the hot wok and toss until heated through and well combined. Stir in half of the crackling mixture, then transfer to a large plate and sprinkle over remaining crackling mixture. Top with seafood, eggs and spring onions. Spoon over a little more sauce and serve with sliced sunfruit.
