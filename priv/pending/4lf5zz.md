*By Ghruznikh gro-Lhurgash, shaman of clan Lhurgash.*

So Falinesti's gone, and the Wood Elves are all whiny about it. Yeah, it might be a sad time for them, but it gives us the long awaited opportunity to build a proper stronghold here in central Greenshade. The Falinesti Faithful won't be happy, but if they try anything we'll just lob off their heads and put them up on spikes like they do in Hammerfell. That will probably teach those weak and stubborn little Elves. We'll throw the rest of the bodies in the Vengeful Pit.

Many of you wonder *why* it's gone. Even though it should be obvious to any who have been a part of the clan for more than a few years. Mauloch has heard our prayers! Have we not prayed for years to Mauloch, begging him to make Falinesti go away? Years ago we prayed for Mauloch to make the Elves of Vullain go away aswell. Did they not disappear soon after? Although the Blackroots that replaced them aren't that much better. Mauloch has taken the Walking Tree to his Ashen Pit. There he tortures its inhabitants for causing strife for his loyal followers. And has Falinesti's Summer Site not been taken by the Orc-Father's Daedric servants? Was it not during the summer that Falinesti disappeared from this realm? There should be no doubt among Mauloch's children.

It is evidently the work of the Father of Grudgement! Let us honour him by defeating the puny Wood Elves of this land, and create an Orcish kingdom to rival both Yashnag's Falkreath of old and Orsinium itself!

Beshkar Osh Ornim!
