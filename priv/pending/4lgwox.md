“Trap[s] of the Lunar God”

*A Testimony for Doom-Drum’s Intent by Serjo Morag Sul-Relas, Cabalistic Knight of Haymon &amp; Aleshut*

Aurbis- interplay, a play of opposing forces accumulating, colluding and infinitely colliding. The Universal Plot: begetting- plots within plots, traps lay’d within traps to beget a final solution. AMARANTH.

*“This is the love of God and he would show you more: predatory but at the same time instrumental to the will of critical harvest.”*

Critical Harvest- *“‘a series of calamities that will bring about the end of the universe’” and “‘the marriages that must happen between them, each one.’”*

At Convention occur’d the first of these marriages and the inception of the brilliant Plot. The Lunar God had trapped the Limbs of Mundus and the norms of violence were thus suspended into treaty. Shezarr was then alienated from the “thought-realm of God,” as per agreement, unready as it was to accept the Plot’s fulfillment. Thus the Divine Minde retreated into insanity, Akaishicorprus, “Diseas’d Unto Immortal.”

Immortality- a process of cycles. Certain scholars have noted the similarity between linked phenomena of Kalpa and of “Dream” as proof merely of divergent cultural observance of a singular truth, yet it should only further evince our gradation- plots within plots. Yet why would the Lunar God, who so despises all such systematic confinements of habitual violence, conceive of the Kalpa? It is simple: it is Shor’s cycle- solvent cycle; one to end all others.

Alduin- engine of cycles. For aeons the Aedra are content to allow this process of continuation by “periodic death of the immutable” as the best possible state allow’d by Convention, provided for by their agent: the World-Eater. If so, what was the purpose of sending the Dragonborn, who has destroy’d the system irrevocably? This action of divine intervention has come from the late recognition by the Infirm Dragon- obsessed eternally with His owne longevity- of the true nature of the “Material Prison.” The Kalpic system which regulates the Mundus was designed from its birth to collapse. This was the brilliance of Doom-Drum. For, fearing this cyclical failure, the Aedra provide a “loophole”- if they cannot continue thus, they must instead risk stagnancy: one Kalpa- this Kalpa- everlasting, if they have their way. Yet this too was wanted from the start:

The Last Dragonborn- a true victory of the seminal Lunar Manipulation; at the climax, in one beautiful being, Akatosh and Shezarr work in harmony again, tho realizing it not, in a final action to ensure the success of Plot. Alduin- make no mistake- is gone. We shall see the dire effects of this as our world continues in decline without hope of renewal. Self-proclaimed heroes will come forth to "rescue" us: they call themselves Thalmor. They will try to reverse all the calamities back unto the Dawn state. They are thus indebted to Dovahkiin, who saved for them the Time with which to do this. They will see the Dragonborn as a pawn in their game. In truth, they have play’d into the Trap of Lorkhan. Yes- traps within traps. For, from their folly into the Underworld will come the Solution.

AMARANTH- vindication of the Universe and the calamities therein. One must then perceive: Underking-Sharmat-Septim’s end-Alduin-Thalmor- all were needed to bring us here.

Aurbis- Our Abyss, wherein one sinketh forever into th’ blacken’d decay, the entropic rot of uncounted ages. Alduin was a temporary savior, returning us each Kalpa back to surface, but not back to the Far Shore of our olden bourn, for that time is gone, it is no more. Remove him and at last we find ourselves drawn inexorably to the bottom of the mire, which is where we find our exit at last, the escape route that we needed all along.

AMARANTH- the Ultimate Endeavour, the Dream of Love, and the healing of the Minde of God.

Realize that the Dawn could not have come without the disasters of the Night.

All This Life is based upon Conflict, which has been the Theme of all our Music, necessitating the deception, the traps, the Plot; but in the New Dawn, we will knowe each other at last with an Harmony of understanding and the treaties of violence may be unwoven.
