It is no secret that the most ubiquitous dish in Ykaloni cuisine is corn (or *bé*, in Ykaloni Bretic) in any form, be it on the cob, grilled, roasted, chopped, smashed, creamed, and more. The predominate strain of corn is the native *Ykaloni*, but with the arrival of Imperial settlers mostly from the southern Nibenay in the late third era, other strains have gained popularity, such as the *Nibense Country Gentleman*, or the multi-colored *Painted Hill*. 

A common dish served for dinner is *vachat* (’Herdsman’ in Ykaloni Bretic), a thick stew of meat and vegetables seasoned with *paiv*, a native spice distinguished by its bright red color and spicy flavor, and other spices. 

Many Ykaloni have fond memories of growing up eating *grossli* (derived from the Daggerfellian Bretic word for ‘coarse’, ‘*grossier*’), a thick porridge of corn, for breakfast. Cheap and easy to make, *grossli* is often served with cheese, green onion, egg, and meat. 

No Ykaloni get-together in the heat of Summer would be complete without a crawfish boil. Served with corn and potatoes, the crawfish are thoroughly cleaned and boiled live.

A cheap in-between meal snack beloved by university students and blue-collar workers alike, *frut frit* (literally ‘fried cheese’ in Ykaloni Bretic) consists of a thick slice of *Champêtre* cheese coated in breadcrumbs, fried in butter, and served between a soft Colovian roll. *Champêtre* is a native semi-soft cheese praised for its delicate flavor and smooth, creamy texture. 

In the same vein as *frut frit*, *poutine* is another popular snack food which is little more than a mess of fried potatoes served with cheese curds and hot gravy. Despite its simplicity, *poutine* is extremely popular in Ykalon, with many restaurants devoted solely to *poutine*. 

*Pot de Pecheur* (’fisherman’s stew) is a soup of fresh caught fish from any of the countless lakes which dot the landscape of Ykalon seasoned with hot pepper and *paiv*, with carp and other mixed freshwater fish the most popular variations.
