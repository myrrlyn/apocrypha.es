*Transated from Ayleidoon by Ufahela af-Dhara'na of the No'Raqqi Sisterhood of Ra-Yoku'Iquizzi.*

____________________________________

At the gates of our blessed home,

stands the knight who will never begone.

He will protect our halls from the slave hordes,

and bring peace to the land once again.

With might he strikes back our many foes,

be it man, beast or minotaur.

The power of the Aldmer he will maintain,

and so he honours his ten Ancestors.

With Welkynd light and Varla might,

the power of the stars he on Nirn brings down.

He makes the marauders highly short-lived,

and locks the foul minotaurs down in the darkest pits.

Beldaburo he forever will defend,

from enemies both within and outside.

The locks of the slave pits,

he locks very tight.

When all this is done he will walk out,

from the gates of our blessed caves.

He will raise his blade high toward the sky,

with the glory befitting only a knight.

He will never bow down upon his knee,

the sign of eternal defeat.

Never will he point his sword toward the ground,

for the Ayleids shall prevail.

For the glory of the Heartland he will fight,

until Auri-El claims his soul.

And that day we shall all mourn,

the hero of Beldaburo.

When thhis wicked war is won,

all shall remember our mighty knight,

and the recaptured slaves shall bow to his shrine.
