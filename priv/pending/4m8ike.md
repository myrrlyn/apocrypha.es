Men of the Reach! Today the Nord Bear under the wing of the Dragon marches on our homes! They are weak! For thousands of years did our ancestors till this fertile land. Only the man turned god could temper our ferocity, and now this Empire has renounced their greatest hero! I tell you brothers, the day I give my freedom to the Eagle of the South is the day I lie cold! Let these bears come. The indomitable spirit of our Red-Eagle is with us. No dragon nor bear can stand our wrath! Let the Nord's come; they will break their teeth on our horns. Our walls are stone and our hearts are fire! The ancestors walk with us this day. So pray not for victory my brother's, for that is assured. Instead pray for glory, pray that the old god's themselves will sing songs of your deeds! Hold now, they approach... Rain death my brothers! Let the blood of the bears flood our mines and stain the silver red! Litter the ground with their bodies! For the Reach!!!
