"Look!" Said Daighsenn, "And listen!" speaking through the 16-spectrumed sand of his divine domain.


"You will honor Me, Daighsenn the shrimp-god who fought the sponges in yore days, and my mother-wife Maira who's greater to me in all things but one, and timeless Dor-Uá-Ga who cast me and us to farstone, and my dear daughter Joffer, eyes keener than any, whose living-bone-ashes I made you and this place from."


"You will honor Dui Bla the lifewater tide, Mailach belovèd guard, Themach the death of miracles, Aca sponge whose scream we surf, Magnos who gave suicide to the weak, Shéor the sponge who pretends to be a Man, Mannimarcos the man who pretends to be a sponge, Glean Manking who founded your kingdoms before the birds, and Faolan who will usurp me."


"Respect but do not honor Claiva the short path that leads to the drop, Hirsian the endless chase who will never see its end, Bridea who mourns and hates and knows nothing but, Dagon the undertaking of impossible tasks, and Duplicate-Devil who thoughtlessly did battle with the sponges and boiled water unevenly."


He displays then his naked flesh from which his ruddy carapace was rent in days of no significance. "To do this; for you have lost your beautiful shells, you will wear only solid and pure color." He stated, his antennas bristling in dominance and eye-bal floating above in wormish manner.


"For you have lost your gills, you will wear simulacra about your necks. And for that you have lost those most beautiful things, the eyes that see all lights, you will demand aid from the shrimp."


He raised then his wrists, from which the sinews of his old form still hang and said; "Do this and your rituals and I and my lessers shall be pleased."


He vomited up then the flower-gods Tagduvos, Jos, and Jelde, who maintain the structure of his domain. "Refute this and you will leave you to boil. Go now and bring the worthy foes to My domain."


I AM DAIGHSENN, SULFURSAND-SHRIMPKING.

ALL ARE FROM I AND I AM FROM THE WATER.

OBEY ME, REACH ME, EAT ME.

THE END OF THE WATER IS 16 SPECTRUM SAND.
