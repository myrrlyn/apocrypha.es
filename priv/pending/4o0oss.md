Just a small thought exercise for those interested:


Think of the Dreamer as a puzzle, and individuals as puzzle pieces, stumbling amongst one another, being both puzzles made up of uncounted moments of consciouness, as well as parts of the eternal being of the Dreamer. The Dreamer and the Dream are one, as the nature of being of the eternal, is one of static self-reflecting completeness. The Dreamer exists by viewing itself through perpetually "smaller" pieces of eternity - moments of "vision", of "being".


Thus it goes, that the eternal is in a state of perpetual "shatteredness" into eternal moments, which are themselves conglomerated into seemingly time defined individuals, with the potential of understanding the nature of the individual moments they are made of, in relation to the eternal. 


When the individuals recognize that the world and its individuals, including themselves, are but conglomerations of eternal moments, the individual conglomeration achieves Love. Naturally it follows, that this individual conglomeration of moments ceases to hold individuality and zero-sums, thus the effect being one of that conglomeration of moments never having existed - the entirety of the individual in time is freed, and their existence as individual conglomeration negated. 


When they achieve Love, yet persist in the reality of their own conglomeration - that conglomeration which recognized Love in the first place, and perhaps succeeded in shaping the Dream without changing it (as change would imply time), they do so in the form of achieving Royalty or CHIM. This is a stepping stone, whereby a conglomeration names itself eternal, just as the Dreamer is eternal, yet does not go beyond the Dreamer, other than by molding the Dream.


The final step that we know of is Amaranth - which is basically a form of autogamic reproduction of the eternal Dreamer, if you think about it. Think of the entirety and completeness of being, producing more than itself, through breaking off a part of itself and setting it aside, in order to exist seperate from itself.


So, if a Kalpa is "an epoch starting at the begining, and ending at the end of time", this would make it but a name of the Dream, as viewed through the lense of the temporally defined individual conglomerations. Different Kalpas are thus different Dreams - one Dream/er having risen from another, without necessarily ending the later.
