##Hi. Just something I wanted to post regarding invocations for the "nine" divines. Any comments? I based these "invocations" on the different parts of the body (whether beast, men or mer), since lore-wise they gave up a piece of themselves to shape Nirn. 

**NOTE: This is just my interpretation of the Divines. Feel free to voice your own opinion about them below. Enjoy :)**

Mara, the Blind Lady of Sight, the Lifeweaver, the Mother of All  

We should all give thanks, for She shattered Her eyes, and gave it to us  

to let us see the difference between good and bad  

Although unclear, and a dusty lens at best  

Her eyes see the truest form of Benevolence and Malevolence

Akatosh, the Dragon-god of Time. Whose very heartbeat time follows.  

Whose very weft and movement shapes the energies around us.  

We should give alms, for He gave us His blood,  

In times of aid, should the need arise,  

The blood will boil, and heroes will follow.

Zenithar, the Pillar of the World, and He Who Made Order  

Bless us with wealth, and guide our Hands  

Guide our hands to perform miracles and wonders  

Hold your pillar firm, give order to the world  

And we shall praise you back with glory.

Kynareth, the White Lady. The unimaginable Lady of Eternal Space  

You who gave All breath, the Breath of Life  

She who Breathes through the Wind and the Sky,  

She who shrouds her children in fog and rain  

Give us Breath, Make us Move, Give us Life

Julianos, The Lord of Knowledge and the Master of the Muses  

Inspire our Ears, let us hear the Knowledge you speak  

Help us learn to Listen, to Nature and to Society  

Play your symphony of Wisdom  

For us mortals to hear

Arkay, Grandmaster of Life and Death, Lord of Our Fate  

Ye who has one Foot in the Past, the other in the Future  

Make us learn the beauty of all Walks of Life  

Each step, a progression towards Death  

Yet together, we march in Life

Dibella, She who is the Pure Maiden, the Enchantress of Life,  

She is the bone that holds structure to the world  

Help us understand the meaning behind the beauty of nature  

The Earthâ€™s Bones, shaped to perfection and beauty  

Our bones, shaped to glory and determination

Stendar, God of Mercy and He Who Speaks his Tongue  

Command us, lead us to a glorious Utopia,  

Where Kings are Noble, and humble, and Strong  

Your mouth that speaks the laws of the land  

May we speak with the same Forbearance in mind

Talos, Mighty God of Disputes and Reasoning, the Mortal One  

Your blade sliced a veil between the Warring Three  

Live once more, half cloaked in Light and Dark  

Send your sword and staff to aid us Mortals  

When Fear grips our hearts asunder
