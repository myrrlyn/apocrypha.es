*The Elder Mer is being put back to bed by the Nurse and Doctor, reaching towards the Temple Priest.*
&gt; 
&gt; **ELDER MER**
&gt; 
&gt; Hear me! I owe you too much… *kaff*...

-
&gt; **ELDER MER**

&gt; **ELDER MER**
&gt;

***PANEL 2: BATTLE SCENE - “NIGHT”***

*Everything is green. Two heavily robed Mer(?), in the same manner as the Temple Priest, look down on the reader.*

&gt; **ELDER MER (O.S.)**
&gt; 
&gt; *HWAKK* *KAFF KAFF KAFF*... hurts.

&gt; **TEMPLE PRIEST**
&gt; 
&gt; “This is the love of God and he would show you more: predatory but at the same time instrumental to the will of critical harvest, a scenario by which one becomes as he is, of male and female, the magic hermaphrodite.

***PANEL 6: PULSE PLAZA - “NIGHT”***

*Skyscrapers and mechanical, single passenger cliffracers dot the skies.*

&gt; **TEMPLE PRIEST (O.S.)**
&gt; 
&gt; “Mark the norms of violence and it barely registers…
