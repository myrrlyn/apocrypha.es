[file:  Zed-9:Aka resonance:5E/804]

[the memospore opens in crackles of suffused nigularity]

[the distorted image of a Moth priest forms]

[his appearance is ragged; he is missing his left eye, in its place swirls a swarm-form simulacra, glowing faintly; his head is shaved and a number of scars line his scalp]

They’re becoming desperate, the other priests.  They have reason to be.  The Thalmor unleashed a Wild Hunt on Cheydinhal; somehow the people escaped the city.  The county, I fear, is a haunt of demons now.

The Nords…gave in to Hircine before the end:  a mass of werewolves falling on Bruma.  They killed General Sulindrel – the Butcher of Bravil – before turning on one another.

So it falls to us, Alessia’s Chosen.  We are the Last Men.

[he is quiet for a time]

And so the Choir.  The priests have been using the O.Y.A.R.S.A. for centuries:  a warframe intelligence is an invaluable tool, after all.  But to put our faith in digital emanations?  One can’t argue with their results, though.  If the priests can find a way to incise the temporal limen we could send them back, use the Thalmor trick against them.  You’d like that, wouldn’t you, Aka?  The mythos is distorted, though; the Choir protocol keeps replicating.  There are Nine of them now – Nine Ghosts.

Decius has sent a communique via Dreamsleeve.  It seems his men have found something.

[the memospore crackles in the manner of temporal passage]

[the same Moth priest, face unshaven; he is uncharacteristically calm]

They’ve surrounded the City.  A final siege.  It won’t be long now.  But…

Oh, Aka, the sweet, sweet irony.  It almost makes me believe in a higher Being, something that hates you as much as I do.  That now, in this hour, we should find it.  Everyone believed it was destroyed millennia ago with the Ur, but Decius believed…and he found it.

[he raises a hand to scratch his face; it is a machine-hand made in Dwemer fashion]

If only we had more time to study it.  I suppose anything is possible.  “This Heart is the Heart of the world, for one was made to satisfy the other.”  Appropriate we should use it against your favored.  The only question is:

What to do with this power?
