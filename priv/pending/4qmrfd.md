Did this a while ago for a GoT-styled fanfic based in Tameriel. Never finished that project but didn't want this to go to waste. The numbers denote place in the political hierarchy. I tried to make it as simple as possible, but yeah, probably not working out.   

The Aldmeri Dominion: 

1) The Taurn’aran (High King/Queen): The Official ruler of Alinnor and the Dominion, is essentially a figurehead. It is a hereditary role that goes to the next of kin, regardless of gender. 

1)Arpensel(House of Nobles): A body comprised of Nobles that makes laws and confirms laws made by the High King. Members vote by casting stones onto a scale. These stones are weighted based on the land the Arpena controls. Members are from Allinor and Valenwood. The client-states of Anequina, and Pelletine also have representatives, though they cannot vote.

1.5*) The Thalmor: An old and traditionally mistrusted political minority in Alinor. It comprised of only the most traditional Nobles in the Arpensal of Summerset. They rose to power during the Oblivion Crisis, where their greater magical prowess helped them defeat the invading Deadra. Now, they comprise a vast majority of the Arpensel and run a ruthless secret-police force. Each Arpen loyal to the Thalmor indict their allegiance with a black and gold band around their left bicep. 

1.5*) Hini en' I' vesta(Children of the Oath): A minority party within the Arpensel. It is comprised of hardline Green Pact Bosmer and vastly outnumbered by the Bosmer members who have become culturally Altmer, many of whom have not been to Valenwood in years. 

2)Arpena (the nobles): The real political force in The Dominion, they are landowning nobles that join together in the Arpensel.

2) El-harnaen’ohta(Holy Ruler of War): The leader of the Arpensel, elected by its members, he is the real leader of the Dominion. He appoints all the Justicars and Governors, leads the military, and has control over the spending of Dominion resources. Traditionally a short-term position, used only in times of war, the current role is a lifetime appointment. 


The Kingdom of Alinor:

1)Taurn’aran(High King): See above.

2) Arpen: See Above

2a)Hama Cora(Seat Leaders): The highest level of Arpen below the El-harnaen’ohta. They are equal to counts in Cyrodill, and command great respect. Technically, they are only Hama Cora while in their seats of power, otherwise they are styled “Lord/Lady Cora of-----”. There are seven Hama Cora in Alinor. 

2a) High Kinlord/kinlady: The rank of nobility denoted to Arpena with especially imported holdings, or to those who serve in an honorary capacity beyond their noble duties. It is also a rank given to non-hereditary members of the royal family as a symbol of their status.
        
2b) Kinlord/Kinlady: The standard title of land-holding nobles. It is hereditary and does not treat inheritance differently between men and women. 
 
2c) Cannonreeve: A noble who rules over a city or settlement, styled “Lord/Lady Cannonreeve of ------”

2c) Battlereeve: A military commander of noble birth, styled “Lord/Lady Reeve of Battle”
	
The Elven Principality of Valenwood:

1) The Prince of Valenwood: The ruler of all the land of Valenwood, by allowance of the Dominion. The Prince, much like Alinor’s Taurn’aran, is mainly a figurehead. Most power resides in the Arpena of the Dominion. The few powers that remain on the mainland are split between the Prince and two other individuals. His main governmental function is as tax-collector for the Dominion. The Prince is chosen by the Silvenar from amongst the sons of the former Prince. 

 2) Treethanes: Leaders of the Tree-Cities of the Bosmer. They are very important, as all trades must be made in the cities, with witnesses. The Treethanes inherit their roles, one that is equal to that of Celeborns.

2) Celeborns: Six Celeborns are sworn to the Prince to govern their given lands of Valenwood(called a Cele). In reality, they are weak forces, who try their best to maintain control in their typically wild Celes. 

2) The Tribal Council: The tribal council is made up of Chieftains from across Valenwood. It is called by the Silvenar to make new laws, or by the Green Lady to rally the people to war. The council hasn’t met in hundreds of years though. They typically only do so during serious events. 

3) Chieftains: Local, tribal leaders, typically male, who control the hunting grounds of their given area. While they could be considered “nobility” on equal par with Cyrodilic Barons, or Nordic Hirrmen, this is an unfair comparison. 
		
*) The Silvenar: A political and spiritual figure in Valenwood. He is found by the Spinners to act as the embodiment of the laws and culture of the Bosmer. He is also the ultimate adjudicator of hunting rights in Valenwood, an important role. 

*) The Green Lady: Also found by the Spinners. She is married to the Silvenar in a ritual called the Handfasting. She represents the power and spirit of Bosmer. She is suppose to be the leader of the Bosmer armies, though she rarely exercises this role. 

*) The Spinners: Priests, law keepers, advisors, and prophets. They are one of the key institutions of the Bosmeri way of life. Based out of their school in the tree-city of Silvenar, they also have roles as stewards in most of the great halls of Valenwood. 


*= Political figures or bodies whose place in the hierarchy is shifting or difficult to pin down.
