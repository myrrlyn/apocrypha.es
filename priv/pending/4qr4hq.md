[file:  Zed-9:Aka resonance:5E/804]

[the memospore opens in crackles of suffused nigularity]

[an image of the same Moth priest; he appears to be positioning the mnem-spore’s perspective]

[he steps away, revealing a vaulted room with a central altar; hovering over the altar is an object of indeterminate shape – at times it appears to be a piece of ebony, at others a Heart orbited by black liquid forming and re-forming into arcane sigils]

[several priests gather around the altar and begin chanting]

[the memospore flashes in patterns of temporal erasure]


[the same scene but spattered with blood; the Moth priests lay crumpled on the ground, as knights in Akaviri armor move among them.  One glances at the Heart before opening a voyance; the image of a Moth priest emerges before him and speaks]

“Well?”

“We found them, your Grace.  They were performing a ritual…with this.”

[the knight positions the voyance to permit a view of the Heart]

[the priest speaks]

“Akatosh preserve us.”

“What should we do?”

[a voice, faintly heard through the voyance]

“Your Grace, temporal incision detected at coordinates…gods…no…”

[the image of the priest flickers, he appears shocked]

“Initiate the Ghost Choir.  And alert Hir, it’s…time.”

[to the knight]

“Leave the Heart and get to your ships.”

“Yes, sir.”

[the knight closes the voyance and begins to move out of sight but a flash of green energy suddenly strikes him; he and the other knights are reduced to incomplete syllogisms, collapsing in a slurry of if-then contradictions]

[a Thalmor justiciar walks into view]

“Well, well:  the Heart of the World.  I can think of several ways to use such a powerful artifact.”

[a voice from off-screen]

“Is that a memospore?”

[the High Elf turns to examine the ‘spore, raising his void magnifier]

“How droll.”

[green light emerges from the emitter]

[transmission ends]
