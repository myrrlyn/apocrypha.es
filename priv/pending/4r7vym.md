*The elegant booklet is displayed in a wood and glass case, easy to spot in the middle of the shop. Its ruby-coloured leather binding and gold-adorned title letters make for a beautiful item. Several other copies lie next to the case. It seems to be a catalogue collecting the adresses of many establishments interested in various artistic endeavours in all of Tamriel. If you're a person of taste, you know that this might prove an interesting acquisition. « And it's only sold here », the young bookseller tells you with a proud smile.*

**Artistic Catalogue of Tamriel, 3E 433, First edition**


&amp;nbsp;


[...]

Note that this catalogue only lists a broad overview of the finest or very most renowned artistic establishments in Tamriel, not accounting for the hundreds of other places delving in similar affairs. Thus it is non-exhaustive, but has the presumption of including only the most interesting addresses in the continent, and maybe even a little further. If you want to draw our attention to a fine place or company that has not been covered in the present edition, or for any complaints and reclamations, please address your formal letter to the new publisher of the *Artistic Catalogue of Tamriel* : Miss Bertille Montrose, The Ruby Binding, Market District, Imperial City, Cyrodiil.

*This is a little list I've been wanting to write for a time now. Since I run out of time today, this is a trimmed down version, and thus the addresses are not complete (do places in Tamriel even have addresses ?), and the comments of Bertille on each place aren't present. If you're curious about some of the places or companies, I would be very happy to give or invent more details. But I think that this may be enough on its own to spark imagination.*
