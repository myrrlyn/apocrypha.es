**(This book was recovered from the old abandoned Bagrakh Stronghold in eastern Wrothgar, I know not exactly what it means, but it will be sent to the Wayrest Mages Guild for further study. If any of you touch the pages I'll rip your guts out and then use them to make bowstrings, which I can shoot you loved ones with! Just kidding, but you know what I mean. *- Yndreth, the librarian*)**

I AM

Those two words are the fundaments of the Aurbis itself, which are words that I am glad that I can utter truthfully (I almost pity the Mortal weaklings sometimes). I have served many Daedric Princes in my time, with Mehrunes Dagon being the one I was closest. One learns much in the service of the Great Daedra, and the libraries of Tzuzzachanar-Nyak was invalueable for my understanding of the Aurbis. While serving lord Fa-Nuit-Hen may be fun (watching Daedra and lesser creatures defeat eachother over and over never gets old), I miss my place as Malanagaiakyn in the court of the Prince of Destruction. In such a position one has access to as much knowledge as is contained in the entire Azuvea-Pado Region. I do not envy Dalazkyr, who Dagon replaced me with, however. My final banishement from the Deadlands has very painful, and Falanyalyeaht on the Plane's burning sky passed before my eyes many times before I drifted towards the Void. I wish not return there soon. I rember that the banishment felt much like when my Vestige first took on a physical form in the experimentation chambers of Lyg. The beautiful Lyg, which had to be abandoned when Lorkhan's hand of death began to reach towards it. This makes me think of of the miserable existence of the Mundial mortals.

I AM NOT

That must be the fundamental words upholding the Mundus, as it is cut of from the rest of the Aurbis in the way that it is. The fools who followed through Lorkhan's dark plan, and were not wise enough to flee in time, gave up the right to truly BE the second that they bound themselves to Nirn. By manipulating time and bending AKA to their will some, like Malacath (he is still holds a grudge against more or less everyone because of that) have managed to escape the chains of the Mundus, albeit with the help of Ada that ARE. I think that I might truly pity the Mortals, who have been bound to their existence by being above them, unable to make their own meaningful choices. Some of them fight very well too, it's always sad to see them die (they never recover from it, it's awful really). Are thoughts like this normal for Daedra like myself? I'll have to ask someone later. It does makes me feel even more proud to be immortal and eternal, however.

But my master's tutor tells me not to record this further, and therefore I shall not (at least not much). He tells me that I must attend a meeting between lord Fa-Nuit-Hen and someone who in writing refers to herself as "*??????*". Hopefully it will not be all too boring. But I cannot say that recording one's thoughts is any less of a waste of time. I would like to continue my work on my Theater of Despair aswell, although I know how much the work tiers me. Strange thing that...
