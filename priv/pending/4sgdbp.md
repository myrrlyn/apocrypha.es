________________________________

We remember Golkarr, great Goltragga of Orsinium and clan Igron.

His Tumn within Grudgement Hall shall never be forgotten by daughter or son.

He stood proud with the Ornim people when Joile assaulted our home.

And to Golkarr's aid came all, even the animals and creatures of Wrothgar.

For many years Smelter stood strong, but dark Breton magic subdued it.

Soon fell Hammer to the Breton wizards, and Temper followed shortly.

And Joile's armies slaughtered Ornim-folk and Malacath wept tears.

In his last moments Golkarr prayed to Malacath, for the Murimush to be banished.

And Malacath said to him that all the invaders shall be gravely punished.

For Joile's foul actions within that holy hall every Breton and Redguard shall feel the Ornim Crunzaga.

Joile's army destroyed or took all of value in Orsinium, but city's ruins still stand proud and tall.

And the Great Pyre of Grudgement still burns in its heart, and in the heart of every Ornim.

From Orsinium's ruins Vosh Ornim carried Goltragga Golkarr's body to a shrine deep within Sorrow.

They placed him there in a Tum together with his favourite Rakh and Agra.

His memory lives on in every true Ornim, and especially in the hearts of geat clan Igrun.

We shall one day march on Breton lands, and slay their armies with Osh.

We shall extract Crunzaga on their kings, and bury their cities with Or.

Remember the last Goltragga of Orsinium, and feel Malacath's wrath within you.

Protect Wrothgar, our home since Dawn, and slay the human murderers.

**Goltragga Golkarr eb Ornim ag Krazak Nirn**
