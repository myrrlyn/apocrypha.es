I am replaying Skyrim for the millionth time, and realized something very interesting. When the dragon attacks helgen ralof, hadvar, tullius, and everyone in general loses their shit, but Ulfric is eerily calm. When ralof says "COULD THE LEGENDS BE TRUE?! IS THAT A DRAGON?" Ulfric straight faced calmly replies "Legends don't burn down villages", and just stands there.

Ulfric was chosen as a young boy to be a Greybeard, and he trained with them for I believe 10-15 years, but he left the Greybeards, and went rogue to fight in the great war, and use the power of the thu'um against his enemies. However I find it odd that Ulfric was chosen as a young boy to train with the greybeards. This only happened 30-40 years ago so if the greybeards chose young people to teach the thu'um to wouldn't we see children at High Hrothgar training? 

I believe that Ulfric Stormcloak showed signs of being dragonborn, and was inducted into the Greybeards, because he was thought to be Dragonborn he was taken to Paarthurnax since dragons can "sense" other dragon's souls. Paarthurnax could tell he wasn't dragonborn, but because he still showed such promise they taught him the thu'um anyways. 

I believe that Ulfric Stormcloak knew Paarthurnax, and perhaps even knew that the dragons would return one day, because Paarthurnax told him that he stayed at the peak of the Monahven waiting for Alduin to return. 

Due to his strong faith, and strong belief that he was protecting Skyrim I think that perhaps Ulfric prayed that the Gods would save him from execution. Talos, and Akatosh decided to save him not only, because he was doing right by the Gods, but also because it would have a butterfly effect of sending the PC on the path of the dragonborn and defeating Alduin.

TL:DR Ulfric knew that the dragons would come back, and that dragons were real, and wasn't surprised by the the appearance of a dragon at Helgen, because he knew the Gods would help him.

Edit: It appears my account was hacked by some foolish Nord. Disregard all of the above blasphemy. The Aedra are weak. Sithis is the one, and only true God.
