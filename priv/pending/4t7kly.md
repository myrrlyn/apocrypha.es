According to the Greybeards, Dragonrend is a force of hatred, spawned from the vitriol the ancient Nord Tongues had for their draconic overlords. It imposes awareness of mortality upon their immortal minds and souls, something so horrific to consider that the dragon is forced to the ground.

I am here to propose that Dragonrend is not just hatred, but Hatred, as in the opposite of metaphysical Love.

Love has been explained to me as an awareness of the oneness and continuity in all things. It is necessary for CHIM because one must become truly aware of one's place in the universe, and yet rise above it through assertion of Will, or self-extancy. It is a dismissal of the illusion of uniqueness, and a celebration of the similarities underlying all creation.

Mortality, and therefore Dragonrend, is an inherently selfish experience. Mortality salience, the realization that death is inevitable, is so terrifying because it promises the end of all that we are: past, present, future. Even for those who believe in an afterlife, there are moments of doubt, where the void stares up into a person and asks the simplest question: "Who do you think you are?" It rouses our fear of ceasing to be, with all of our complexities. Mortality is utter revulsion and fear of the very same concepts Love holds so dear.

As such, I believe that Dragonrend taps into a deep sense of bitterness and Hatred that is antithetical to Love, and to the Rulership that comes from it. Using the jealousy, hate, and clawing cowardice inherent in the mortal condition, all in conjuction with Will, projects a sense of deep unmooring, where suddenly one is not part of, say, a draconic oversoul, but instead a single entity, adrift and foundering in a dark sea, with nothing but one's own thoughts and experiences to keep them above the waves.

JOOR ZAH FRUL. You wear a broken crown, but you will break the crowns of your enemies to build your throne.
