*From priestess Tilortil to Ri-Lor Najhium-dro of the Lor'jo-Khaj*

These Khajiiti fools have no idea which foundations their town of "S'ren-ja" rests upon, or who I am for that matter. They think that I'm a simple cleaner, ha! I have been able to conduct my research beneath the city almost completely undisurbed, no one has even asked what I've been doing. It only took two days for me to find the enterance to the Krin-Athra temple in the hills east of the town. Entering the temple was simple, the gate into it had been broken and the rusty traps were not difficult to avoid. Inside the temple  have found engravings which I have difficulty making out what they depict. Some seem to depict the three Moons, Lorkhaj being far darker and prominent than Jone and Jode. Others appear to depict the Dro-m'Athra, escaping from Namiira's Scuttling Void in great numbers and slaying all living Khajiit in their path. Deep within the temple I found a glowing, magically sealed  gate, with depictions of Lorkhaj and Namiira, and a complicated looking puzzle before it. Thankfully I was able to bypass it completely thanks to a hole in the wall. After going through this hole (which seemed large enough for four Orcs to pass through side by side) I found myself in an enormous chamber. Its beauty is impossible to describe in this letter, so I urge you to come here yourself, or send a poet of some kind to try to find a way to describe it. The chamber was both bright and dark, and I was almost completely carried away by what I saw. I think that there might have been Moon Sugar fumes in the air (there oftentimes is). I saw many stange things which I am uncertain if they were at all real or not. Anyways, when I started to see more clearly I wandered to the back of the chamber. There I found a great wall, and it is because of it that I write to you in the first place. On this wall stood the following in Daedric letters:

I have no idea what it means, but I'm hoping that you have. In any case, make sure to send someone over here, this temple needs to be searched and examined thoroughly. I keep discovering new secrets every day here.
