Almalexia had no True Need, until sandal-shod Lord Mora Nerevar arrived at Her throne-step seeking freedom.

Perhaps she was a liar from the beginning; after all, consider that Dumac &amp; Nerevar coalign'd in order to drive out the Nords by force: their Empiry was not yet dead in VÃ©loth. Also recollect that this ideology of "race" has never been aught to Tamriel but a construct made to satisfy straight-lines, whereas culture has never been so conveniently transfixt, and even the golden-skin of Ayem does not preclude that she was a Nordic Princess in the land of Chimer, or- at the very least- a figurehead install'd by shaggy-breeched interlopers. Mournhold was named as such by the children of Kyne, the wife-in-mourning to Shor &amp; as a priestess of Kyne, Her position would have been equivalent to a Queen, &amp; would account for her remembrance as a "storm" in [ulterior scriptures](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/what-my-beloved-taught-me). Recall: she was attended by the Shouts.

&gt;Ayem was accompanied by her husband-state, a flickering image that was channeled to her ever-changing female need.

-*Sermon 8*, Vehk the God

This "husband-state" smacks of the [Western theosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_king#Frazer.27s_interpretation) maintain'd today by neo-totemist &amp; Reachman cults.

Why then, would the mother of the Mourning Hold lower herself to the dust cover'd *canvasari* who appear'd to her with nothing more than the sword he had lifted against his master &amp; a dream of Velothi Liberty, when clearly all the gain could only be his? 

Perhaps the Mother of Morrowind was, at this time, a maid to the ensorcellment of love. Befitting a childe of Boethiah, the man-whore Nerevar inserted himselfe into Her Grace's throne by means of amour; he came to knock down Her husband imago- Her Shor, Her year-long lamb-King- &amp; usurp'd the statehood thus.

Or, perhaps by this time the *canvasari* had already amass'd such a force on the platform of Nordic Abrogation- the records are not clear- that an army of thugs prepared to gut "the bitch-whore of storm if she [did] not take [his] hand," &amp; thus, at the tip of a kinjdal, She converted.

But what if She did love him truly? Then, what was Her motive for Foul Murder?

Well, we should not forego to consider Her animosity with the boy-slut, Vehk, that bravo of a poet whose askance-wise view of Her can be glean'd from the Sermons. The love-triangles, quadrangles, or otherwise octangular trysts surrounding the Lord Nerevar have been speculated elsewhere. Could it be, in the den of Foul Murder, that nothing more than the over-spent tension of this intersexual dilemma was the impetus for a domestic homicide that would batter ages with its repercussions?
