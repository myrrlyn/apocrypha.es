In listening rooms beyond Resdayn, the music of Her mad screaming teem'd Golden against the Drum-Beat of his death-

But why did She go mad? Was it merely the bereavement of Her Heart-sunder'd Godhead? But how could the mighty Face-Snaked Queen, the beautiful &amp; venomous Cala-Velóthi, the Fortress-Flower, be de-fanged thus? It is simple: for Her holy Madness was a myth-echo of the most pre-eminent theme- the Aka-Tusk.

Even the shoddy Imperial scholars of a bygone regime remark truthfully:

&gt;most aspects of Akatosh which seem so important to the mortal races, namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy, have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine Tribunal.

-*Varieties of Faith*, Brother Mikhael Karkuxor

When Blesséd Almalexia rose to royalty, &amp; became the State- Mother Morrowind- She thus touch'd the [Mandala of Kings](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/3/33/Uriel_Oblivion.png/revision/latest?cb=20120125120012) &amp; join'd in the Oversoul of Emperors, graced by Akatosh, Dragon of Time.

And the death-mongrel known as Pelinal was even thus:

&gt;beneath the Pelinal's star-armor was a chest that gaped open to show no heart, only a red rage shaped diamond-fashion, singing like a mindless dragon, and that this was proof that he was a myth-echo, and that where he trod were shapes of the first urging.

-*Song of Pelinal, (Vol. 6: On His Madness)*

Where She stepp'd were ever urges of the unmaking: rescinding into wetness. For he who enters Paradise, enters his owne Mother.

[By the ravening tusks of Her murder-face](http://michaelkirkbride.tumblr.com/post/85251665173/vivec-is-at-the-side-facing-away-from-the-viewer), the Mother of Morrowind became alike unto the Kyne-sent Knight, as Kyne alongside

&gt;Mara and Dibella and sixteen Daedric elements: all contributed to the snake-faced queen when she touched the drum. Their sum? A Beauty Cala as none have seen. Cala! Wetness of Kingdom!

-Nu-Hatta, of the Sphinxmoth Inquiry Tree

A War-Fractal in the service of the Mad-Tusk, blood-dipp'd in the ebony effluvium of it's mirror-refraction Lor-Khan, whose heart resonated with the 16 Golden Tones that became the murder-mourning song of Alm-Alessia, the Dragon-chosen. As she wore the Face of Boet-hi-Ah, thus remember that the Prince of Plots was the once-shadow of Lorkhan &amp; under-reflection of Akatosh, &amp; thus the admixture of Madness that was born when the Dragon heard the utterance of "[NOT](http://aurbis.c0da.es/e8e/e8e.pdf)" &amp; broke the mirror of its malediction. 

The Heart-Shard cut the mind of the Dagoth Primate as well as all the others whom it touch'd. Thus, at the end, Alm-Aleshut charged upon her recursive husband, Nerevar Reborn, with the blood-mantra "[O Sweet Shor, for our shared madness I do this](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:The_Song_of_Pelinal,_v_6)" upon her Golden lips.
