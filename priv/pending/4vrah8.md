*The page turns of its own free will, as Aka-Tusk has unfolded, the mother entered is dead...*

The death-drawing of a swift Voidknife sings behind you. To five corners, the Temple-fire awakens.

"Behold, and cast aglance of Hyper-Jerallinopel, wherefrom emerge as He did out of Fatherland of yore, the shardling drakes of Father-Tusk, and

"Scion of the Lord dances in the glass-mire, heralding Renewal to the North, baring the False liege to retributive fangs.

"Thus, child, hearten. And may the Heartland hearken to the Dragon-yearning. You were born-anew, awakening into the Free-Sept of Covenant as you gave your blood into the Dragon's Chalice.

"And fire Walks-Away with the Somnusurper.

"And razors cut behind the Black Blasphemer.

"Thus we lift our razors;

"We intone: BOET-HI-AH NUIT-HIE HYAET AE HOOM. NU-MANTIA!

"Nu-Mantia; Liberty!"

-Brother Xenon
