**(This note was found among the belongings of a missing Argonian citizen of Stormhold. The Stormhold Guard hopes that you, the honourable members of the Mages Guild, may be able to provide information about this "Silken Ring". Any information would be invalueable to the Guard, and may help us identify members of this potentially dangerous organization. - Raynil Ilvasum of the Stormhold Guard)**

*By Shadowcaller Velsetha Damori*

The Silken Ring is open to any ex-members of the Dark Brotherhood, Morag Tong and any others who wish to join and are willing to unquestionably serve the Webspinner Mephala. The Silken Ring is a group of assassins who serves the the greatest of the three Good Daedra, Mephala. While many Dunmer loyal to the Murderous Godess and have seen through the lies of the ALMSIVI may join the Morag Tong, we in the Silken Ring advise you not to do so. The Morag Tong has long since abandoned the principles of Mephala, and are now no different from any other minor group of assassins. Their decline in numbers and popularity recently is exactly what they deserve for this betrayal. An Argonian Shadowscale will likely end up in the hands of the delusional Dark Brotherhood. The Sithis they worship is not real, and the "Sithis" of the Dark Brotherhood is very much different from the ancient god if the Hist by the same name. Shadowscales, do not be decieved by the Dark Brotherhood's lies! Join us instead, and honour both Sithis and Mephala, who is both Sister and Daughter to the Great Darkness. Let Mephala whisper to you as she does to the Hist. Become the mortal equals to her Daedric servants, the Spiderkith.

Our headquarters are in the old Imperial ruins southeast of Stillrise Village and west of the Ayleid shrine of Nen Ria. There we listen to the words of Velidreth, the Lady of Lace. She, together with the great Spiderkith Kephidaen, state Mephala's orders to us. The Cradle of Shadows is directly connected to Mephala's realm, the Spiral Skein. From there Velidreth and Kephidaen recive orders directly from Mephala herself, and when those orders reach us, along with our Field Captain Dranos Velador, they are followed immediately. None of the wait for anyone to "accept" a contract that is common in the Dark Brotherhood exists in the Silken Ring. All members of the Silken Ring who die will forever be bound to the Spiral Skein, and will there recieve an afterlife of limitless amonts of murder, sex and all other kinds of pleasure. In the Spiral Skein the tower is One, the strands are Eight and the lessons are Forever. It is a perfected reflection of Nirn.

So what are you waiting for assassin? Join the Silken Ring today, and help to spread Mephala's great Shadow.
