The defeat of the Empire and the WGC sealed a very dangerous cessation of hostility between the Mede Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. Along of the terms, there were two particularly bad: the Imperial betrayal of Hammerfell, the Redguard province, and the baniment of Talos and denial of his godhood. Hammerfell, however, manages to stand and fight the Dominion, and Talos worship survives.

There was a third term, however, and often overlooked one: allowing Aldmeri officials and other ranks free pass and range, including housing, in Imperial lands. In fact, it seems that every significant noble in the lands of the Empire has a Thalmor agent nearby. That includes embassies with garrisons in Skyrim capital, Solitude, and the Imperial capital in the WGT. This term was by far the most dangerous one.

To most people, the idea of a fractured Empire would be the downfall of Man resistance to the Dominion. The Stormcloak dream of a nation actively fighting the AD is seen as foolish, if not a downright Thalmor plot to undermine and collapse even more the resistance of the Empire. In fact, with the widespread publication of a document found on a decimated Thalmor embassy on Haafingar by a an unknown force, possibly tied to a remnant of the Blades, outright claims the Thalmor benefits of the torn by war state of the Nordic lands, and that the leader of the rebellion, Ulfric, son of Hoag, Stormcloak is a dormant contributor to the Aldmeri forces.

This idea, however, is impractical for several reasons. The very first being, of course, the difficult of the contact between the Stormcloaks and Thalmor: the animosity between the two is simply too great. The second one is conflation of Nordic Heimastyra, home rule, and Stormcloak rebellion. Nordic self-rule always existed, with varying degrees through the ages, most relevant for this Era, however, is its own Epoch. The extinction of the Septim line, and the events known as Oblivion Crisis, tipped off a new wave of secessionism over the Province of the Nords, the baniment of Talos worship was also a major turning point to motivate the Nords to take up arms. Many would be the reasons listed to approximate a cause for the civil war, not at all relevant to the point, which is the following: the war was inevitable, Ulfric was simply the one to take upon himself the deed, regardless of his reasons. As such, the idea of a over contrived plot of the Thalmor to weaken the Empire even further falls short into a abyss of variables and outcomes, specially for a race known for the obsession over control and mastery of situations like that of the High Elves.

Above all, against the Thalmor plans, is their expulsion from Stormcloak controlled territory. That alone removes the biggest advantage over Man the Dominion could ever have. The AD has ears on every hall, a agent on every table... and a assassin on every throat. Regardless of political affiliation, unless you are Thalmor, the diminished numbers of Admeri agents contributed more than people realise. Right or wrong, this rebellion is cutting the Thalmor its ears, agency and its advantage.

An alert to the Empire will remain, one order and all of your plans are gone. The infiltration is too rooted.
