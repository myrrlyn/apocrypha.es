...As he climbed the slopes of the Illrfell, he prayed. He prayed to those who would listen. He prayed to the Fox. He prayed to the Hawk. He prayed to the Wolf. He prayed to those who would hear him. Those who would care.

He did not pray to the Dragon. 

Never again would he pray unto the Dragon.

The wind whipped around him and ripped through his clothes. The frost stung his nose and face. Still yet he pressed on. Such was his mission.

From the upper shoulders he could see the lights of Jylkurfyk burning on the horizon, like a spiderweb of stars. Still he pressed on. And thus he came upon the cave. He cursed, *"Where art thou, Father Fox, for thou hast sired thine children who art in need? Where wert thou, Mother Hawk, when the walls of Bjǫðheiðr fell? Where wert thou Mother Wolf, whilst thine children died by the blade and spell?"*

 As he entered the cave, a great storm erupted outside. From the storm, Kyne spoke thus:

***"Shield ye self mortal, lest ye be rendered to dust."***

The Wanderer did thusly hide himself behind a stone. And out of the storm did Mother Hawk speak:

***"Know this, I am the Mother of Men. I spoke thee into existence and I can erase thee thus. How dare thee question me."***

**"Were thee there when I set the measures of the heavens? Were thee there when I made the Snow-Throat? Where were thee when I made the clouds? Were thee at the Moot, when mortals were spoken into existence? Where wert thou there when thine Father died? Answer me thus!"***

The Wanderer cowered in the might of the Hawk, but still spoke: *"I speak on behest of the betrayed! Those whom this heresy hast destroyed! We beseech thee for thy divine help!"*

And out of the storm, Alduin descended and thus spoke:

***"Oh mortal, why dost thou seek our help?"***

*"Oh Lord,"* spoke the Wanderer, *" I seek the help of the divines to defeat the Heretic priest who seeks to usurp thine power!"*

And Alduin Spoke. And the mountains did quake. With the beating of his wings, forests were flattened and mountains leveled.

Kyne thus spoke; ***"Oh, Wanderer, why do you seek to upset this balance?"***

And thus the Wanderer spo....(untranslatable)...*"...ays the Lord of Destr..."*...

..."Spoke thus the Lord of Twilight...

...Spoke thus the Hawk and Dragon,***" Freeze now, forever unseen! Freeze now, forever unmade! Thine blasphemy hidden! Thine unholy acts unmade!"***...
