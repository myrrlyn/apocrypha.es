A letter regarding House Sadras, intercepted from a correspondence between two members of the formerly Great House Hlaalu on 4E129



Cousin Mordas,

It's a complete affront is what it is! Those savages that dare to call themselves House nobility. A generation ago they were nothing but savages rooting about in the Ash-Wastes for grub while we were opening channels and bringing real commerce to these lands. House Hlaalu had finally been regaining the recognition we deserve! But now those Nix-Hound feeders- just for preserving the Old Ways of the True Three- are rising, accepting the ways offered by Redoran! I would bet if they were to meet with their former tribesman they'd not be so lauded.

Now here they are, walking the streets our Ancestor had lain down, turning our shop into veneration halls. Turning bazaars that have brought trade to our lands into training grounds for their chap'thil- Ash Warriors they call themselves with their strange mystics blended with spear and sword.

What would our Ancestors say of us, Cousin?

And our situation is growing ever more perilous. The damn lizards are just the topping on the cake after the Red Year, but it's these Sadras that are our problem NOW! Cousin I know you would support what I've in mind. I have a friend I have been having words with. He's quite the forester I hear tell and he has some equally good friends for trimming these weeds from our garden here in Narsis. Perhaps we'll show these savages how we keep our gardens trimmed. The fat from the lean.

We've been friends since childhood. I know you won't dissapoint me.

Oh and how is Cousin Dreyla? I know you two are quite close despite her father's wishes. Do you remember that time he'd chased you like a kagouti with his spear near his netch farm? I hear age has done little for his temper. He and I are negotiating a joint venture to a kwama mine.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours truly,
Cousin B

After this letter was brought to the attention of the local Sadras guards, who quickly began interrogating Mordas, "Cousin B" was discovered to be Brealyth Hlervu, who was once an investor into Imperial Forts in the area North of Narsis before Ald'ruhn was destroyed and the Tests of Faith that the Oblivion Crisis brought to the Dunmer.

Brealyth was shown the laws of House Sadras as their mystics and Spellsword guards worked in unison to both leave the Dunmer more susceptible to flame while simultaneously burning his hands and tongue as weapons of treason against the Great House. Their ties to both Great House Redoran and the New Temple- coupled with the general animosity towards House Hlaalu following the abandonment of Morrowind by the Empire- caused little protest to arise from the population of Narsis which had become the Sadras base of power.

Brealyth currently resides at the Temple, only barely supported by the Priesthood alms and cleans the Temple walls as best he can with his ruined hands.

Like them or no, Sadras has the backing of the Redorans and are unapologetic about abandoning most of their Ashlander tribal customs. Punishments such as this are obviously not amongst them.
