**(Must the Shadowed Path befoul every wall in Bruma with their propaganda? Do not listen to what it says, the words of the Shadowed Path are nothing but lies. Do all inhabitants of Bruma a favour and destroy any notes like this that you find. - Alfar Rot-Tooth, guard captain)**

*By Laverique Obscuriam, magister of the Shadowed Path*

I understand why many of you may be afraid, inhabitants of Bruma. I understand that the fact that Daedra now walk the streets before your homes and that a Daedric portal sits above the city is frightening to most of you. But you need not be afraid. Agents of the three alliances have been spreading lies in the city, lies to make you wish to join their ranks and fight to the death for their cause. I am also told that the Bruma guard has been assisting these agents in convincing you to sacrifice your lives for a unjust cause. They say that the Fellowship of Anchorites is an evil "worm cult" which wishes nothing but the death and destruction of us and everything that we love, that they have been sacrificing innocents to the "evil" Daedra. As I think that many of you wise inhabitants of Bruma have realized, nothing could be further from the truth. When the Alliance War broke out you were starving because none of the three alliances were willing to trade food with you, all they wanted was waepons and more weapons. Who was it then who gave you food and protected you homes from bandits? It was the Anchorites, assisted by my own Shadowed Path, was it not? The Fellowship of Anchorites summoned the Daedra purely to protect you, despite what the alliance agents will tell you. It is true that they serve the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, but it is necessary to once again grant peace to this war-ravaged Cyrodiil.

The priests in the chapel will tell you that the Daedra are evil and that they wish to claim Nirn for themselves, or even destroy it. Once again I am sure that you can all see through these thinly veiled lies. Have the Daedra here in Bruma ever killed anyone but bandits or alliance soldiers? While they may have occasionally wounded Bruma guards and those who would run to their defence I assure you that that has been purely due to misunderstandings, and the Daedra who have done such things have been appropriately banished. Molag Bal is just as concerned about the people of Bruma's wellbeing as anyone else, and those Daedra who harm innocents will surely be punished harshly in Oblivion. You have surely heard many ill things about Molag Bal and his Planemeld, that Molag Bal is trying to take all of the Mundus for himself. These are or course nothing but lies spread by alliance agents to make it seem like we have a common enemy. It is true that Molag Bal is trying to integrate Nirn into his own plane of Oblivion. This is nothing to fear, instead it should be celebrated. In Oblivion there are no such things as death, war or sorrow. While Molag Bal usually does not interfere in the affairs of Mortals he could not stand idly by and watch as Tamriel was torn to pieces by war. He reached his hand out to great Mannimarco of the Elder Council, and asked him to assist in bringing peace to Tamriel and Nirn. For that sole reason the Fellowship of Anchorites was formed.

Do not let Tamriel be torn apart completely by war and conflict. Allow Molag Bal's plans to succeed. For in Oblivion you will be granted an eternal life of pure bliss, and you will never have to worry about war, death, pain or hunger ever again. We beg of you, join the Shadowed Path, or the Fellowship of Anchorites, for all of Tamriel's sake. Do not deny Tamriel's peoples a happy life by our lord Molag Bal's side. Do not fear the Planemeld, for if it does not succeed we will all die by the alliances' blades.

For Molag Bal, for the Planemeld, for Tamriel!
