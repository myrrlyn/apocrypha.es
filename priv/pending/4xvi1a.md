We all know the Daedra, the Princes of much

they do have much power, but Nirn they can't touch

so when they want to speak, it is up to you

to give your life to one, and act for them too

&amp;nbsp;

Azura the soul star, of dusk and of dawn

she will bless you richly, on her you must fawn

she will love you dearly, she'll tell you no lies

unless you betray her, she's vengeful but wise

&amp;nbsp;

Boethiah the snake, of plots and deceit

he'll guide you in battle, keep you on your feet

with hammer or dagger, you will slay the weak

she'll make you the victor, unless you are meek

&amp;nbsp;

Clavicus Vile the masked, of power and pacts

he will grant you wishes, reward any acts

but always remember, to listen with care

his deals may seem to be, not always that fair

&amp;nbsp;

Hermaeus the vast eye, of knowledge and fate

if you desire wisdom, your hunger he'll sate

in his void so endless, the truth will unfold

but if you stay too long, your tale stays untold

&amp;nbsp;

Hircine the great were-stag, of hunting and game

succeed in his grand chase, and he'll give you fame

but his hunt is constant, so carefully see

that you stay observant, or hunted you'll be

&amp;nbsp;

Malacath the foul axe, of outcasts and spurned

those shunned by kings and queens, to this Prince they've turned

but don't expect mercy, if you choose to fail

for he shows no pity, no grace for the frail

&amp;nbsp;

Mehrunes the dawn of fate, of crises and shift

if he is unleashed then, his act will be swift

but Dagon is also, of floods and of flame

and Nirn as you know it, will not be the same

&amp;nbsp;

Mephala the spider, of death and of sex

she will teach you intrigue, the trusting you'll vex

but don't grow complacent, she cares not for you

and if she betrays you, your joys will be few

&amp;nbsp;

Meridia the star, of living and light

she'll give you protection, and blessings so bright

unless you are undead, or shield those who are

her light will purge you and, your friends near and far

&amp;nbsp;

Molag Bal the monster, of bondage and strife

you will learn oppression, how to own a life

the Harvester of Souls, is what some call him

so do as he says or, your fate will be grim

&amp;nbsp;

Namira the vile bat, of filth and decay

disgusting devotions, she'll show you the way

but few want to partake, where she is the host

the eating of others, is slandered by most

&amp;nbsp;

Nocturnal the raven, of darkness and night

through secrets and shadow, she will grant you might

but don't pretend to know, what lies in her shade

just keep thieving on or, your blessings will fade

&amp;nbsp;

Peryite the dragon, of order and blight

through sickness and cleansing, you will reach your height

but being his vessel, you'll have sealed your fate

no remedies for you, it is much too late

&amp;nbsp;

Sanguine the rose of blood, of passions and lust

your mind you will alter, and gashes you'll thrust

of fun and of parties, you will know it all

until it consumes you, and leads to your fall

&amp;nbsp;

Sheogorath the madman, of joy and of hate

in every emotion, he seems to partake

but you cannot fathom, where his mindset goes

his sphere may be order, I don't think he knows

&amp;nbsp;

Vaermina the serpent, of fear and despair

the pious may sidestep, her nightmarish glare

but if you fear omens, she's not worth the cost

it's best to avoid her, or you will be lost

&amp;nbsp;

Sixteen there are of them, known to you and me

who will grant you power, and gifts you will see

be careful who you choose, for their lessons are

demanding and toilsome, but can take you far

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: /u/ludovician 's terrific response:

&amp;nbsp;

You know not the Daedra, you small, mortal fool.

Our power isn't granted or taken by rule.

If we wish to speak, we will find one like you

Who will say what we want to, and do as we do.

&amp;nbsp;

From Padomay's realm we derive all our strength;

We're change against stasis and ends against length,

Without us your life would be blissfully bored

No songs for your drinking, no prey for your sword.

&amp;nbsp;

Boethiah teaches the truth of your worth:

Without making impact, the fact of your birth

Is measured as dust, and dust is your name.

Killing is impact, and impact is fame.

&amp;nbsp;

Clavicus Vile makes a jest of a vow,

Of mortal words, empty as that they endow.

You see them as fixed. He shows you they're not.

Complacent, you asked, and deserved what you got.

&amp;nbsp;

Hermaeus shows you the maze of your mind:

You learn and forget in the way of your kind.

You see not the death of the knowledge before,

You are all in Apocrypha, searching for more.

&amp;nbsp;

Hircine reminds you no matter how fine

Are your clothes and your houses, your food and your wine

Your animal heart fights your noblest of aim.

You chase your own instincts: both hunter and game.

&amp;nbsp;

Malacath's Orcs may once have been Elves,

But everyone exiles a part of themselves.

Your shame and your longing, self-hate and regret:

Those parts of your nature you hoped to forget.

&amp;nbsp;

Mehrunes is destruction, the heart of the change

But with each revelation, familiar from strange

You burn up an innocent child without cause:

The adult you are slew the baby that was.

&amp;nbsp;

Mephala is hidden, her nature obscure

Just as you keep your nature behind your allure.

Only you know yourself. Your friends and your kin

Know nought of the secrets that hide in your skin.

&amp;nbsp;

Meridia's star's for the living alone

But her judgement is only as fierce as your own.

In your mind, only those that you know are alive

You care not if the million you don't know survive.

&amp;nbsp;

Molag Bal is a monster, but then, so are you

You bind with expectance and promises due,

With culture and norms, claiming others as yours

You enslave what was free, chaining souls, shutting doors.

&amp;nbsp;

Namira is filth and decay, and again

She's found in the natures of Beast, Mer and Men.

Reliance on others eats into their lives,

In interdependence her worshipper thrives.

&amp;nbsp;

Nocturnal is darkness, but also, she's luck:

With her, no predicting, and no bargain struck.

You smile on your fortune and curse at your harm

But each undeserved hope that you hold is her charm.

&amp;nbsp;

Peyrite is of sickness, and most of all yours

When you give up your hope and pronounce a lost cause,

For then the disease will quite certainly win

And the one called despair is already within.

&amp;nbsp;

Sanguine is your passion. The moment is now.

Why wait and delay when you'll die, anyhow?

You're mortal. You know that you're wasting away:

Forgetting tomorrow, you live for today.

&amp;nbsp;

Sheogorath's only the limit of sense

When there's too much to handle; the world too immense.

You know that your wisdom is flawed - even so

You make mad choices based on how little you know.

&amp;nbsp;

Vaermina is nightmare - your own inner fear

When you hesitate, seeing your failure draw near.

You fail without trying and then turn away

And your nemesis - you - lives another sad day.

&amp;nbsp;

You think you know Daedra? Little mortal, you don't.

I'd tell you to look in your heart, but you won't.

If you could, you'd have known what I've told you is true:

You don't choose the Daedra. The Daedra are you.
