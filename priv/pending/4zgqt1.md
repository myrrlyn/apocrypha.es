1. In the beginning of all things, the world was formless and without Concept. Out of the Gray Maybe came Magnus, who gave Concept unto the Aurbis, and with this gift, things began to form out of the Nothing. And so was created the idea of Thought and Unthought.

2. In the beginning of all things, the world was empty and without Space. Out of the Gray Maybe came Shezzar, who gave Space unto the Aurbis, and with this gift, things found there place in the Nothing. And so was created the idea of Here and There.

3. In the beginning of all things, the world was chaotic and without Time. Out of the Gray Maybe came Akatosh, who gave Time unto the Aurbis, and with this gift, things found a way to grow and evolve. And so was created the idea of Then and Now.

4. Now things could form, they could move and they could grow. But Shezzar was displeased with this world, for the realm of Spirit was a prison from which they could not escape.

5. And so Shezzar gathered the Original Spirits and spoke unto them; “Let Us form a new world from the old, so that We may learn to Experience and reflect unto Ourselves as was done by Our fathers, ANU and PADOMAY.”

6. And Akatosh said unto the Original Spirits; “This shall be a great Undertaking. From us, w\We shall Sunder Ourselves into many parts. I will not force this upon You, and You will be free to stand away from this new world, now and forever.”

7. And so left the Fifteen Not-Ancestors – these were the days before the birth of Malacath – and the innumerable Stars. From the Stars, Magnus stayed until the Creation, for he would create the plan to form this world, for which he named after the mother of all, and he named this world Nirn.

8. Akatosh gathered himself and formed his many selves into a Plane, for which we have named AKA. Many others followed in his footsteps, creating the worlds of ZEN, JHUNAL, ARKAY, MARA, KYNE, STUHN, and DIBELLA. And from these Planes, Shezarr sundered the Gifted Limbs and gave them to Nirn.

9. But in those days, the world was turbulent and without Stasis. The Gift-Limbs rose from their slumber and met on the Adamantium Tower, and AKA said unto the others; “We have seen the Chaos that has erupted on this world. How shall We keep Our sacrifice from becoming in vain?”

10. And Shezzar said unto the Gift-Limbs; “Tear My Heart from My Body and place Me above this world, so that I may watch over it and ensure it lives.”

11. And so ARKAY, STUHN and ZEN formed themselves into Trinimac, the Knight of AKA-Now-Auriel, and tore the Heart of Lorkhan from Shezzar and threw it into the Red Mountain, and there Shezzar's still-beating Heart watched over Nirn and kept the Chaos from destroying it.

12. And STUHN and ZEN became Tsun, and carried the body of their dead brother into the sky, and KYNE accepted this and named it Masser and Secunda. And Tsun named their brother's new home the Sovereign's Guard, for the gods would watch over the Dead God until one day he would rise and be made Lord Among Divines.

13. And AKA became split and sundered. From his mind came Auriel. From his heart came Akatosh. From his bones came Alduin. From his wings came Alkosh. From his scales came the Dovah and all his Children.

14. And these fragments of the Once Great said unto the Gift-Limbs; “We will watch Our new world, for now is the time for Mortals to take our place as rulers.”

15. And so, with his final gift, AKA and his many fragments gave unto Nirn the gift of Mortality, and so things could finally escape the realm of Spirit.
