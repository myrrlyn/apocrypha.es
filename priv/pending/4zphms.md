*By Vishali-dra, priestess of the Temple of the Dark Moon*

Blessed Lorkhaj, darkened Moon Cat, who in Dawn Times sat down to trap and create.

When shaping the Mundus you made Bent Cats from the weak spirits that you ate.

Together with Namiira the Great you created many a new dark kitten.

Dro-m'Athra you named the members of your litter, and more were created for each Ada that by the Dark were bitten.

As the Moon-Cats sing so shall I, but instead of a song of the Light it shall be of corruption and wicked heartbeat.

The dro-m'Athra are many and different names they carry, but at Namiira's side they all have a seat.

Sa- and sar-m'Athra are corrupted Senche, who serve little pupose other than to be imposing mounts and to Nirni's children devour.

Namiira uses her sa-m'Athra pets to make the lives of Mortals sour.

Dar-m'Athra are those of low m'Athra rank, but they do sneak in shadows.

They whisper Lorkhaj's truth to Moon-Cats and a Moon Bishop's life a dar-m'Athra simply from them blows.

Then we the jo-m'Athra have, once wizard-Cats who from the Dark corrupt the souls of Mortals.

They forcefully make the Light-loving cats make for them many shrines and portals.

Greates are the pure dro-m'Athra, who near Lorkhaj's corpse hide in the Dark Behind the World.

There they make up cruel plans and with Namiira's other children they will slay any bright Kitten no matter if they up have curled.

Lesser cats should trust me when I say, that the dro-m'Athra come for you even if you to Jone and Jode pray.
