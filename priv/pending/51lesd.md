*A prospectus from Bervyn Hlarar, zealot of the New Temple, found in Blacklight around 4E 32.*



The persistent ash clouds of the Red Year finally let room for light. The light of the Reclamations, from whom we turned our hearts. An old but bright light, that we have forgotten. The radiance of the false Tribunal was but a trick, a glowing lamp so close to our eyes it blinded us, putting everything else out of our sight. We fell for that trick, we let their lies crawl in our minds like poisonous ivy on a wall. But now, we know. 

House Redoran kept things in order, because that's what they do. They took over the Council, and organized our lives as soon as the trauma of the Great Fire was far enough from our thoughts. They did right, I can't say otherwise. But they did not make enough.

The false gods have vanished, Azura know where, but their impious faces are still here, mocking us at every corner of our halls and streets, soiling the very ground of our temples made right again, unfairly taking place alongside our beloved saints and ancestors. The Nerevarine did not fight for that. The Nerevarine started to wipe their filth from our land, and we should follow his example. Brothers and sisters, let's finish the work of Moon-and-Star Reborn. Let's consume in the last warm cinders of the Red Year the traces of this era we should be ashamed of.

From all corners of the city, newly enlightened brothers and sisters started to get rid of their books, stained with the blasphemy of the false Tribunal. Join us, and together we will burn the false idols of the Triune in the pyre of their own "Sermons" and "Homilies". 

May the streets of Blacklight be shining with the fires of the Truth-Made-Visible-Again. It's just the beginning of a new era, brothers and sisters. We can't let Morrowind bathing in blasphemy any longer.
