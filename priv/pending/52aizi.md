Now that, thanks to Kurt and LadyNerevar, we have a full official translation of the Dwemeri Rosetta Stone, I'm finally able to put my studies of Linguistics to good (?) use and try to decipher the vocabulary and at least part of the grammar of Dwemeri.
Below is my notes and my transcription of the Dwemeri part of Calcelmo's stone, with commentary.
"-&gt;" indicates a deduction or a connection between two items.

*Chun = and so

*thua- = prefix meaning "your" (plural), in two places it's tua- (transcription error?)

*mer = people

*arkngd = were given (?), were led (?) -&gt; -d = past/passive suffix (?)

*chend = to

*dua- = prefix meaning "our"

*thand = steam garden

*th = and

*hvardn = protection(s) (?)

*btham = math (?)

*amz = many

*ahrk = kill, break

*-an = passive (?)

*kemelmzulchond = snow-throated

*aka = King(s)

*ngz = will(s) (?)

*duum = we (?) -&gt; du(a) -

*melz = hear (?)

*btharng = voice(s), cry (??)

*kanthaln = send

*bcharn = machine(s), servant(s) (?)

*mzin = against

*stur = enemy(enemies) (?)

*btharumz = (to) bind (?) -&gt; -umz = "in order to" (?)

*zel = under

*abak = only

*-ch = by (???)

*umarkng = grace -&gt; arkng = root meaning "to give", "grace" = what is given, gift, um- = passive participle prefix (?)

*thumz = culture (?)

*amakai = survive (?)

*avatheled = fifteen-and-one -&gt; notice it's the same word in the Falmer half, suggesting it's a loanword in the latter language. Probably a central concept in Dwemer culture. Judging from the Falmer half, the fifteen-and-one part is understood in Dwemeri.

*kagr = tone -&gt; Kagrenac (!!!)

*mkingth = new life(lives) (?) -&gt; -(i)ngth = new (?)

*mzan = begin

*du = we (?) -&gt; what about "duum" then? Ergative form?

*chal = desire (?)

*fahl = not -&gt; seemingly coming after the verb in the "we do not desire..." half, but before it in the "for we do not believe..." half. Also omitted in the second "believe" sentence, probably by mistake.

*ngark = thank

*che = it

*bthun = believe, know

*ur = as -&gt; strangely, it comes at the end of the sentence here, but at the beginning later in the text

*ngalft = gratitude -&gt; nga- = root meaning "to thank" (?)

*chal = request (?) 

*thu = you -&gt; thu(a)-

*abazun = partake (?)

*nchur = symbol

*bthar = bond -&gt; btharumz

*nchul = fruit

*nchard = stone(s) (?)

*nchuth = vision

*irknd = to cloud

*irkngth = darkness -&gt; irkn- = root meaning "dark, to darken" (?)

*eftardn = to set in

*thunch = to fear

*fahlz = not -&gt; why -z? Imperative?

*mzual = mercy

*nchuan = light

*rkng = affection

*fahlbthar = unbind -&gt; fahl + bthar

*nchardch = bones -&gt; interesting parallel with "nchard", maybe "similar to stone?" "Hard as stone?", or maybe literally "stones" with "ch" meaning "by" as in "abakch"

*anum = earth (?)

*ralz = before (?)

*eftar = to set -&gt; eftardn = to set in. -dn = ???

*chendrald(ch) = final path -&gt; "ch" again "by", "to"?

*kagren = music -&gt; Kagrenac (!!!), -en = collective (?)

*vanchningth = new eternity -&gt; again -(i)ngth

At the start, I thought "a-" to be some sort of plural prefix, but I noticed it appears with any regularity only in the words prefixed with the possessive prefixes, so I think it's a part of those prefixes.
There seem to be some suffixes the meaning of which I can't understand, for example a -mz and a -nd or -dn suffix.
Finally, some words written together with others are to be written separately, I think.

Here's my transcription:

*Chun thuamer arkngd chend duathand, th ahvardn btham. Amz thuamer ahrkan ch kemelmzulchond aka Mora, th thuangz ahrk, th duum melz thuabtharng, th kanthaln duabcharn mzin thuastur, btharumz thuamer zel. Abak ch duumarkng t[h]uathumz amakai, th abak ch Avatheled Kagr t[h]uamkingth mzan. Du chal fahl ngark, che du fahl bthun ur. Du chal fahl ngalft, che du [fahl] bthun ur. Du abak chal thu abazun nchur duabthar, nchul duanchard. Th ur thuanchuth irknd, ur irkngth eftardn, thunch fahlz. Bthun abak duamzual th nchuan duarkng, chun fahlbthar thuanchard ch anum ralz, th eftar thuachendrald ch kagren thuavachningth.*
