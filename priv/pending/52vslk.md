Yes, of course.  The Ghost Choir is a perennial favorite for conspiracy theorists, Marukhati aspirants, and those quasi-mystics who believe the Second Children of Anu our spiritual apotheosis.  All rubbish, of course, though that fool Vlastrius comes closer to the truth than even he realizes.  Damn him and his competent scholarship!  Hopefully the tide will turn and the Academy will go back to contemplating less dangerous things like Tonal Mechanics (you know I mean no disrespect) or mythematics.

You understand I am hesitant to say more, given our recent experiences.  But you have guessed rightly, my friend:  they are not all dead.  How do you kill an idea?  With another:  one that supplants, subverts and renders superfluous the first.  But this is the very nymic of the Ghost Choir and such is useless against them.  Numidium perhaps; or is that how they became as they are?  Or was it one of their own?  From my conversations with [scratched out] the Ghost we met it is not clear.  She at least remains; but there are many Streams, and who can guess how many more survive in the creases of Time?

But we have larger problems.

Come as soon as you can.  Ra’zhiin will have procured a Voidship by now and Jassa is negotiating for a permanent berth on Neoyneslea – it ought to serve as a suitable jumping-off point and re-supply.  Who knows how much time we have?

The Tones guide you.  My love to Nefriti,
