**SHOR'S LOST GENERAL. Or: THE DAGOTH HERESY**

Harken, Dunmeri brethren of mine! Long have we resided as refugees within Windhelm's walls, scorned and abused.  Our oppressors blame us for our own plight. Say they: we are outsiders to this culture. And I know you grow hateful, brother elves, and reject the Nordic culture out of spite. Say you-- this is not our culture! Nay, we have no history here! We are enemies to them, as they are to us, and it has always been so, and there may be no love between men and mer. 

But take heart, brother Dunmer! For these Nords practice hypocrisy by scorning us as outsiders. Their own God has already accepted us! 

Remember, brothers, the now forgotten teachings of the False Tribunal and the cursed Sixth House. In the First Era, the head of the Traitor House, cursed Dagoth Ur himself, came unto the Nordic people. The Nords mistrusted him, calling him a devil. But it was not so! For Dagoth Ur came not as an enemy, but he proposed to lead the Nords to Shor's own Heart, which had been cruelly stolen from him. 

But wait, think you, would not the Nords reject Dagoth Ur? Why would these foolish barbarians accept the help of the Devil of Dagoth, when he came with such a miraculous claim? Wouldn't these Nords see him as a demon and turn him away? 

But it was not so, I tell you! For Shor HIMSELF declared Dagoth Ur his hero! 

That's right, brothers! The God of the Nords named a Chimer his General! Shor, anon Lorkhan, anon Talos, declared Dagoth Ur a hero of men! And if this was not enough, Shor sent unto Dagoth Ur his greatest hero: Ysmir of Atmora, the Dragon of the North, Wulfharth Himself! Dagoth Ur and Ysmir of Atmora were Shor's dual Generals, his greatest heroes! I ask you, brothers, how are men and mer at odds if even Man's greatest hero would love the Devil of Dagoth, himself a Chimer? 

So take heart, my Dunmeri brothers. Do not feel guilty for the lies of the Tribunal that corrupted Dagoth Ur. Do not weep for your ancestors who turned against this hero of men. Take solace in the fact that if a Chimer were beloved of Shor and His hero, what right have the men of today to say we are hated? 

And when you have time, brother mer, go to the Palace of Kings, and gaze upon the desecrated plaque of Ysmir of Atmora, and ponder our intertwined histories; and know that this hero of men loved a mer as battle-brother, and know these very stones bear no ill-will towards  you or I.
