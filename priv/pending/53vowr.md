“...and under such circumstances did the one who would rule return to the world.  And he spoke: “Mede and rebel, be silent.  For I am the heir of Talos, and of Reman and Alessia before, come to break the world and bring about a fourth Order, divinely ordained.”  About his head were the storm clouds of Kyne, in twisting towers of wrath, black as the depths of Oblivion.  Upon a dragon’s back he rode, and dragons were his honor-guard.

And the generals would have defied him yet, but the soldiery refused.  With one voice they proclaimed…”

“The city of Firsthold was taken, its walls thrown down and its people subjected to the Scourge for their sins.  And so was the last of the Anathemata’s holdings upon Auridon overthrown.  The Emperor ordered that his forces move south, and prepare for the next steps of the war.  When they were assembled, he strode forth, and mounted Odahviing Last-Dragon, and took flight, leaving his armies upon the shore.

And from the air, he spoke the Shout which changed the world.  For the words struck deep at the chains that bind the world, and made them shriek and writhe in agony.  The chains which heard his voice, about the Isle-That-Is-Not, recoiled in pain and loosed their hold about the world.  And loosed from its chains, the cataclysm fell upon it; all its palaces and towers of profane beauty, its armies and its scholars, its fields and its forests, its wisdom and its madness, its people; young and old, male and female, were unmade.

He returned to his armies, where they had fallen upon their faces in awe.  And Odahviing surrendered his soul to the Emperor, and so were the dragons ended.

And Blackmarsh knelt.  And Elsweyr knelt.  And Morrowind knelt.  And Valenwood knelt.

And all Tamriel knelt in fear and horror at the wrack of the Anathemata.”

“...Imperial edict were the scrolls committed to the fire, were the tongues cut, were the eyes put out, were the stiff-necked put to the sword.  For all knowledge of the Isle-That-Is-Not, and of the Anathemata, was rendered Illicit.  And so the debt was repaid.”

“Indeed, as he had foretold, on the third day after the Emperor’s passing did the Planet which had been known as Akatosh burst into blinding flame in the night sky.  For eighty days it burned, under sun and under the moons, and then it was snuffed out.  And on the ninth day after the Silence, Alaavthur revealed that he had taken his father’s throne.

And from that time have been born to the Faithful the Dovahzaam, the Dovahhaal, the Dovahjun, and all the rest of the twenty-seven orders of the Dovahjoor, great and small.   And they have been the priests of Alaavthur.  They have been his generals, his knights, his judges and magistrates.  Though they have quarreled and strove with each other for mastery, none living can deny that with wisdom, they have ruled in his name.”
