Not much is known about the ancient mages, but we do have some of their works. We know that one of the most well known alteration spells, and certainly one of the most useful, was created by a man named Ondusi. 

&amp;nbsp;

While understandable that a young mage exploring alteration would be curious about Ondusi, his time would be much better spent understanding applications and theory of our craft. However, in an attempt to put minds to rest, I have compiled all present knowledge about Ondusi.

&amp;nbsp;

Ondusi is suspected to man of Dunmeri descent, but since the name matches no known patterns, nothing concrete has been proven. The first known instance of Ondusiâ€™s opening spell was discovered in an unnamed ancestral tomb on Vvardenfell, during the second century of the first era. However, during the Nordic invasion of Morrowind, all knowledge of the spell seems to disappear. It then resurfaces in the mid fifth century in Telvanni writings. The spell does not seem to be widespread until the third century of the second era, when the Imperial Mages Guild was formed and spread across Tamriel. Rather than teaching the spell to their inferiors, the Telvanni elite had kept the knowledge of the spell a closely guarded secret, the reason for this unknown to any alive today. 

&amp;nbsp;

The spell is then seen in tomes across Tamriel, being taught to journeyman mages from High Rock to Black Marsh. At this time, the Mages Guild is conducting research into more efficient opening spells, and spells with greater potential. 

&amp;nbsp;

It has been postulated by historians that the spell was a bit of a joke, created by a Telvanni spellwright and given to his magister. This view, however, is seen as unfashionable among the greater scholarly community, as there is little to no evidence supporting it.
