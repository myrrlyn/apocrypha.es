Night time in Tamriel is often dangerous or peaceful, prophetic and spiritual. 

Tamrielic citizens, due to a pre-industrial society, sleep in a bimodal sleep pattern. Citizens have a first and second rest, separated by two hours of being awake. (Which is most noticeable in urban centres). First sleep generally exists from 8-10 pm, and second sleep from 12-7 am. 

Night Hours: The hours of awareness during 10-12 am are what give cities a reputation for night crime. While most citizens eat, socialise, or spend time with loved ones from the confines of their own homes, many take to the streets. It is at these hours guards must be most alert. Brothels, taverns and underground businesses are most profitable during these hours. Secret organisations and politician meetings are said to take place at these times in hushed corners. 

The Phase of the Celestials: Since these hours approach midnight, the monthly constellation is most near zenith. Thus, it is a time when its influence is the greatest on Tamrielic life. Heed zodiac warnings and monthly signs the most during these hours. The Month of the Thief is the most dangerous of these times, and even guardsmen are stationed at double strength. 

The Hours of the Spirits: The period of 10-12 am is followed by what you would expect to be the best time for stealthy missions, burglary and other criminal activity, as people are most likely to be asleep. However, you'd be wrong. The liminal barrier between our own and the outer planes are the weakest during the hours of 12-3 am. Evil and dead things stalk the shadows, and the mind is urged towards darker thoughts. Try your best to sleep through these hours, and be aware when midnight strikes. 

The Moons: the two Moons, Masser and Secunda, have a massive effect on nightlife. When neither are visible, night is extremely dark, often pitch black, with only the creatures of the night finding solace. Night activity is most scarce during these times. 

When Secunda (the smaller white Moon) gleams in the sky, a shimmering silver glow cuts shadow from light in soft, shifting shapes. When the Moon is full, most citizens can navigate fairly well through the night, but shadows are still to be cautious of. The significant difference in light often causes issues with light adjustment. 

In contrast, when Masser (the larger and reddish Moon) bathes Nirn with its glow, the reddish light allows for constant adjustment and ease in travel, albeit it is not as bright. The light of Masser is often seen like blood, and in rare times, Masser indeed becomes the Bloodmoon of Warewolves. Many say to avoid the streets as warewolves, vampires and other terrible abominations of mortals prowl in the sanguine glow. 

When both Moons are present however, night life is most common. When both moons are full, visibility is almost as practical as late dawn or early twilight. This is also the worst time for thieves and criminals, who often wait for another week or so to pass.
