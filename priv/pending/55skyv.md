This is to be a series dedicated to Veloth. The Mer named Saint, Pilgrim, Mystic, Patron of Outcasts, Aldmeri Dissident, Prophet of the Message of the Tribune Gate, Herald of Boethiah, Pathfinder of the Endeavor, Founder of a new Faith, Guide of the Chimeri Exodus, Forefather of the Dunmer. 

He to this day is one of the most influential singular persons ever to walk Nirn who helped shape Tamriel as we know it. All of the iterations of the Dumeri Temple (High Velothi, Tribunal, Dissident, Ashlander, and New Temple) are beholden to him and his teachings. He is one of my most favorite Lore figures, and few mortals, save for perhaps Auriel, Ysgramor, Alessia, or Tiber, impacted history as much as he did.

This first part is not likely to be too profound, or new, stick with me as I'm sure to hit some points later on. Just like is best for all things, I'll start at his beginnings.

**Origins**

&gt;”Veloth the Prophet was scorned by those who were blind to the corruption and spiritual bankruptcy at the heart of their society. Veloth was cast out, cast off, by those with no interest in truth and even less interest in the betterment of all, who sought only to preserve their pride and place by keeping others in poverty, ignorance, and slavery. Veloth was highborn, but he dared to cast off the decadent chains of Aldmeri society.” [Exodus from Summerset](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Exodus_from_Summerset)

Veloth began life as an Aldmer in either the Dawn (claimed in [The True Nature of Orcs](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_True_Nature_of_Orcs)) or Merithic Era (claimed in [Veloth the Pilgrim](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Veloth_the_Pilgrim)). He was born of high station in the Summerset Isles, but came to abhor the stagnation he began to see in his native society, which brings to mind comparisons to [Siddhārtha Gautama]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha). 

&amp;nbsp;

**Foundations of a New Way**

Although Veloth apparently [had no direct association with the Psijic Order]( https://www.imperial-library.info/content/more-psijic-endeavor), he perhaps was a practitioner of the Old Ways of Mysticism as well given his title of “Mystic.” 

&gt;” In the Mages Guild's tradition of finding answers to all things, respected researchers suggested that Mysticism's penultimate energy source was the Aetherius Itself, or else Daedric Beings of unimaginable power -- either rationale would explain the seemingly random figurations of Mysticism.” [Mysticism: The Unfathomable Voyage](http://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mysticism)

PSJJJJ is his only other link to the exiles of Arteaum, but they [viewed Veloth’s Psijic Endeavor “wrong-headed from the start.”]( https://www.imperial-library.info/content/concerning-psijic-order-and-psijic-endeavor) Vivec’s explanation of PSJJJJ 

&gt;” the suggestion that Anu’s son, the Time Dragon, was formed in reaction to Padhome’s influence. In effect, *Anu had finally done something.* This inconceivable effect gave rise to an equally inconceivable cause, and so PSJJJJ was named” Concerning the Psijic Order and the Psijic Endeavor

Veloth recognized that the birth of precreation was made possible due to this action, where the unmovable static (Anu) was inflicted by the unstoppable Change (Padhome), and was forced by its influence into action (which ought to be impossible, as Stasis is supposed to be unchanging and unacting). The birth of Aka (*edit as well as the subsequent reactionary birth of Lorkhan*) and the secrets of the implications of Anu’s impossible action are likely what lead Veloth to receive his revelations from Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura. Though he would name and preach the message and the way that would become known as the Psijic Endeavor, the origins of his philosophies predate him. He was the receiver and interpreter of given knowledge.

&gt;” It should be noted that, while Veloth is given credit for establishing the anti-laws that govern the Endeavor, this process has its antecedents in the teachings of the Black Hands Mephala, Boethiah, Azura, Trinimac, and, of course, Lorkhan, through that lord's association with PSJJJJ.” More on the Psijic Endeavor

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;” a young prophet, Veloth. Boethiah had been speaking to Veloth in dreams and visions, guiding him to lead a new sect of Aldmeri with the belief that mortals could ascend to become gods.” [The Fall of Trinimac]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Fall_of_Trinimac)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;” Boethiah told the mass before him the Tri-Angled Truth. He showed them, with Mephala, the rules of Psijic Endeavor. He taught them how to build Houses, and what items they needed to bury in the Corners. He demonstrated the right way to wear their skin. [The Changed Ones](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Changed_Ones).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;"the so-called Prophet Veloth communed with the Daedric Prince Boethiah and agreed to accept her gifts. He inscribed the Velothi Prophecies, which expounded the doctrine of worship of the "Good Daedra" (Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala), along with ways to propitiate and negotiate with the "Bad Daedra" (Molag Bal, Malacath, Sheogorath, and Mehrunes Dagon)." [Daedra Worship: the Chimer](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daedra_Worship:_The_Chimer)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;” It was Veloth the Prophet who first negotiated the original arrangements with three Daedric Princes, forever defining the differences between "Good" and "Bad" Daedra (as the Chimer viewed them)” [The Improved Emperor's Guide to Tamriel/Morrowind](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Improved_Emperor%27s_Guide_to_Tamriel/Morrowind)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; In Morrowind, for example, he (Lorkhan) is a being related to the Psijiic Endeavor, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them." [Varieties of Fain in the Empire](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Varieties_of_Faith...)

The goal of his Endeavor was the transcendence of the mundane form through selective subjugation to the chosen desirable forces of change (The Good Deadra) by allowing them to inflict you into producing the impossible reaction of your static shape into producing *something new.* This transcendent transformation is said to lead towards surpassing or surplanting the existing gods themselves.

Veloth also taught the dangers of what powers that you shouldn’t allow yourself be shaped by as you are forced to be inflicted by their actions upon you, and he named them the [Four Corners of the House of Troubles](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_House_of_Troubles). The change they caused to your self was to be guarded against as it led you astray from the desired path to transcendence.

&gt;” the four Daedra Lords, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath, are known as the Four Corners of the House of Troubles. These Daedra Lords rebelled against the counsel and admonition of the Tribunal, causing great kinstrife and confusion among the clans and Great Houses.”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;"Saint Veloth also taught the difference between the Good and Bad Daedra, and won the aid of the Good Daedra for his people while teaching how to carefully negotiate with the Bad Daedra."[Lives of the Saints](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Lives_of_the_Saints)

&amp;nbsp;

The foundations of the ancient practices of Dunmeri Ancestor worship also were likely first set down by Veloth. The Mantra of [The Doors of the Spirit]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:The_Doors_of_the_Spirit) reflects the beliefs, as well as [Ancestors and the Dunmer](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ancestors_and_the_Dunmer) which is a detailed account of the observations of an Imperial scholar. Evidence of these practices being handed down by Veloth is provided by the Dissident Priests.

&gt;” While challenging the divinity of the Tribunal, the Dissidents do not challenge the sainthood or heroism of the Tribunal. In fact, the Dissident Priests advocate restoring many of the elements of Fundamentalist Ancestor Worship as practiced by the Ashlanders and by Saint Veloth.”[Progress of Truth](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Progress_of_Truth)

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;"The Chimer, ancestors of the modern Dunmer, or Dark Elves, were dynamic, ambitious, long-lived Elven clans devoted to fundamentalist ancestor worship. The Chimer clans followed the Prophet Veloth" [Before the Ages of Man](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Before_the_Ages_of_Man)

*Edit, spelling, I had intended this to be the intro of a Megathread, but found I lack the attention span and discipline to save it, so it'll be released in segments*
