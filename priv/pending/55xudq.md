*In first light, naught but night and abyssal lull*

*A world lead to red dreamt the causal null*

*Swiftly his sway spread, culling all qualms,*

*and soon the cepheid aeries bled*

&amp;nbsp;

*All by one he approached then reproached,*

*with forked speech and shallow preach*

*Spinning slights of most intimate sights*

*For his reign had never waned, as whole or hollow,*

*His slither scales could hiss all hymns*

&amp;nbsp;

*One such sprite, my parent deceived,*

*Brine-blooded lord of my line*

*his precepts by all perceived*

*So Beseeched, so besieged,*

&amp;nbsp;

*Love willing he lent his might*

*unsullen in cycled echoes,*

*a grafted gift to the limits conceived*

*Of this world-wheel by magic schemed*

&amp;nbsp;

*Tamnuche na Tamnuada*

&amp;nbsp;
 
*Withered in vim yet unwavered in will,*

*he wandered long till valleys thronged,*

*of storm-lit trees and mana-milled seas*

*soon to still at a sight of saintly grace*

&amp;nbsp;

*Her sapphire feathers gleamed,*

*laurels of twilight steam*

*Their kens akin, their eyes beguiled,*

*a world in mind forever entwined*

&amp;nbsp;

*Tamnuche na Tamnuada*

&amp;nbsp;

*My nascence sealed in heartland's isle,*

*a feat of love and melancholy fate*

*Their doom a glimmer in specter's eye,*

*self-twinned villain of fire's flow*

*whose sight would suffer naught*

*of a union that should never grow*

&amp;nbsp;

*The demon flared a duplex glare,*

*his axioms rung a familiar drum*

*The biskin swore by foreign fables,*

*and swung in rhythm roars*

&amp;nbsp;

*His spear he smote,*

*His scythe he then broke*

*Blow after blow*

*the demon did bring my father low*

&amp;nbsp;

*Though the devil swung still,*

*his dictum drivel dripped yet*

*A portent poison ,an elegic injury,*

*a frame fracture of no recovery*

&amp;nbsp;

*His might made to molt*

*feeble and torn, ripped of his role*

*Wilting his weeping wails*

*as nix tides swallowed him whole*

&amp;nbsp;

*A daughter null the serpent snared*

*sweet swears of sordid affairs*

*Led upon lies to a promised plane*

*stolen of one who died in vain*

*wherein she would lie of love denied*

&amp;nbsp;

*His celestial bones exhumed,*

*twined to her feeble form entombed*

*Thus afflicted, my curse inherited,*

*his rage runed into memory eternal*

&amp;nbsp;

*A burdening boon, this blessed hatred*

*A path to tread, where gods have bled*

*A pattern scribed above the mortal dead*

*A scar on the soul forever stained*

&amp;nbsp;

*Tamnuche na Tamnuada*

&amp;nbsp;

*Through dusk dimmed years, and saturnine tears*

*My foreign furor my mother feared*

*and so spoke of her sorrow's root*

*an envenomed recall of father's fall*

&amp;nbsp;

*I ran to kin and clan, a plea to present*

*An answer to anger, father's final fate*

*Prolix the debate, for so few's consent*

*Though these faithful rallied, we set sail of scryed intent*

&amp;nbsp;

*Through frigid gales and frozen shoals ,*

*we had found my parent's shores*

&amp;nbsp;

*Warped in grief, a marred avatar,*

*our whittled praise struck no scar*

*He cradled sorrow and sought no solace*

*In  this place where love lasts only while forced*

&amp;nbsp;

*Over wail-waves and howl-winds,*

*we sailed way of hollowed hope*

*Till sudden flowed a lustrous light*

*Our road waylaid, a spirit-sol,*

*brazen-bright, it proffered birthright*

&amp;nbsp;

*See the breaking before the dawn*

*The shatter-birth of all aspects*

*Annul the fault and restore all spectra*

*Fates paved and blood ablaze*

*We sailed garbed in aurean rays*

&amp;nbsp;

*Hail Merid, mourning cleaved spirit,*

*soon will cease your silvered tears*

*This hoary treaty, sworn by blood and zeal*

*by the seas betwixt and heaven's bairns,*

*All of our offers for concept cruor*

*All sunders sealed, reshape the compass cairn*

&amp;nbsp;

*Merid mirror-mended,*

*true love reascended*

*unfettered the feather,*

*of its ravenous heart*

*A new echo in its place,*

*unphased of previous folds*

*and sees when gods may not behold*

&amp;nbsp;

*Tamnuche na Tamnuada*

&amp;nbsp;

*In heartland's core, our spirits toiled,*

*till tongues wound and weaved*

*about twin shades in parallel planes*

*for  all about the crux, all steps jungled*

*are steps by all doubled*

&amp;nbsp;

*Skyward the spire grew,*

*Varla-mallari, center of solar dew,*

*pillar of imperial endeavors*

*Flux-forge and sum of all favors*

&amp;nbsp;

*Welkynd flow of beryl veins,*

*fractal-fixed till its petal'd peak*

*Fibril by fibril entwined,*

*echo conductor of reality's prime*

&amp;nbsp;

*One final step to settle*

*Spirit stone of starry royalty*

*the new heart, the new key*

*born of the blessed aid of blue*

*of a hunger for dragon's issue*

*for with but one soul, their scales interlaced*

*will its mythic lock truly be graced*

*a soul shaped in mirror to mine*

&amp;nbsp;

*The distant drums beat to his steps*

*a solemn song for his final breaths*

*the serpent's mark mar's his breast*

*but the king's furor steeps his soul*

*seeded symptom of his true sire*

&amp;nbsp;

*Tamnuche na Tamnuada*

&amp;nbsp;

*A beginning as it should have been*

*Eight the shape-slaved sinews,*

*Ten the tangled panguard of mer current,*

*One the chiral clash, fate of all ways*

&amp;nbsp;

*Our heralds restored and continuum severed,*

*all debts repaid and sins redeemed*

*A world of flowing flux, a canvas infinite*

*the extinction of want and woe*

&amp;nbsp;

*For one is always made to satisfy another*

&amp;nbsp;

*Tamnuche na Tamnuada*

&amp;nbsp;

*His curse is mine and mine is his*

&amp;nbsp;

*Tamnuche na Tamnuada*

&amp;nbsp;

*Eight and None*

&amp;nbsp;

*Tamnuche na Tamnuada*

&amp;nbsp;

*HE MUST COME.*

&amp;nbsp;

*OIOTAMNUCHE NA OIOTAMNUADA*

&amp;nbsp;

*ALDMERIS*
