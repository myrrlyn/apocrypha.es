…that the so-called ‘Prophet’ is long-lived cannot be doubted – and probably comes from the same occultic power that keeps his friend, Telvanni Kalas Sul Saren, alive after two and a half millennia.  Yet this farcical skooma-dream about the Heart of Lorkhan and rescue by the Alma’s Daughter is nothing more than a legerdemain to obscure a truth he wants all to forget.

Ra’zhiin makes many claims in his ‘Memories’ (including single-handedly healing our beloved plane(t)), but the truth is that he is nothing more than a Thalmor conspirator trying to hide his atrocities in the Last War; that the War ended more than three centuries ago does not absolve his guilt.  His fanciful stories - including the claim that he has lived to see the 11th Era and fought in a war between the Hist and Jills (ridiculous) - are part of a long line of distractions.  But what else can be expected of a Daedra worshipper?

The Heretic of Alinor must be brought to justice and answer for the countless lives he helped to destroy.  As he is so fond of saying, “You cannot escape Memory…”

Ra'zhiin returns this week in Landfall: Day Zyr.
