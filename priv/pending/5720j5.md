*This loose page was found in an abandoned priory on the nibeney, and appears to have been the part of a longer text.*  


May the nine guide and protect us from the void dwellers, and let this serve as warning to the unwise:  
Beware of the reflections cast upon the waters of oblivion, for they are distorted and malicious:

Peryite who is Akatosh.  
Nocturnal who is Julianos.  
Clavicus Vile who is Zenithar.  
Hircine who is Kynareth.  
Sanguine who is Dibella.  
Azura who is Mara.  
Boethia who is Stendarr.  
Mephala who is Arkay.  
Namira who is Shezzar.  

Beware of the ever-growing troubled house, for now they embody the chaos and change they once suffered:  

Molag Bal who was Ruddy Man.  
Mehrunez Dagon who was Demon King.  
Sheogorath who was Jyggalag.  
Malacath who was Trinimac.  

Beware of the abandoned, for their kin do not wish for their company:  

Meridia, light left behind.  
Hermaeus Mora, knowledge left behind.  

And, I beg for the sake of us all, beware of the leech of the dreamsleeve, for its hunger will never be satisfied.
