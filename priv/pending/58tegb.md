LEVEL 9 CLASSIFIED INFORMATION

The following is an excerpt from a damaged book salvaged from the remains of the infamous Operation: Bookworm. The text is an account of the last days of Mael of Kuri, a dreugh king, as his kingdom was destroyed by Mehrunes Dagon during the fall of Lyg. Fourteen Mananauts lost their lives and twenty more went missing in the halls of Apocrypha during their failed mission, and this text is one of few to make it back to the Battlespire.


King Mael of Kuri spent four days (his last),
In the deepest crevice of his Coral Palace.
Outside, mobs of liberated slaves
Tore down the walls their ancestors raised.
The forces of DAGON drew near
And the King was laden with fear.
While Mael was cornered in his own city,
He turned to the gods to beg for pity.
But gods often demand a price,
Souls must be given in sacrifice,
With a heavy heart, the king killed his children, all twenty,
Each one of them to a different deity.
To each god he pleaded for an escape from DAGON,
But none had a use for such a fearful pawn.

The-Dark-Chalice was reviled by his cowardice.
[the next two lines are completely illegible]
[illegible, not words, but previously unknown symbols] said no.
Bright-Blight laughed and cried and began to [shed?] [light?].
[illegible] found his [situation?] hilarious.
[illegible]-Kons gave him an incomprehensible response.
[illegible] found [his sacrifice?] weak,
And refused to speak
The-Sweeping-Souls had [illegible].
[illegible] was [unable?] to assist,
So he fled in a [flowery?] mist.
And Numid-unCHIM, simply tried to bed him.

King Mael gave up on the Magna Ge
And went looking for another deity.

The Dreaming One had seen in his head, and his mind was not fit for her alive nor dead.
The Dark Lady listened to his livid spiel, and deemed him unworthy to deal.
The Spider came and heard, and then left without a word.
The Huntsman came to hear him pray,
But had no use for lesser prey.
The Spirit Daedra came and went,
Leaving behind a pungent scent.
He disgusted the Pitmaster, Peryite,
Who viewed his cleanliness with spite.
He did the same to Sanguine,
Who saw his soul as far too clean.
Morning Star knew his fate
And viewed his sacrifice with hate.
The Black Knight laughed at his fright,
And orderly Jyg had no interest in Lyg.

With no children left, he turned to his wife.
The one who helped him through all his strife.
BAL was his last choice for a savior,
But from other gods he won no favor.
The cowardly dreugh did not want to fall,
And so he killed his wife in in the name of BAL.

A darkness descended in the already dim pit.
Queen Hymal's corpse began to quake and fit.
A figment of BAL bursted out of her gut,
Spewing black blood from the massive cut.

"Oh Great Lord BAL. I beg of you to save your slave! I am still your loyal thrall!"

"Your lies do you no good, pathetic spec!"
Screamed the Lord down King Mael's neck.

"Madame Webspinner had a word with me,
And I require some clarity.
Before I was summoned here, you see,
You killed your children, all twenty.
From twenty gods you begged for aid,
And with your offspring's souls you paid."

King Mael went pale as dead,
He saw that he had caused his end.

"WHY DID YOU NOT COME STRAIGHT TO BAL WHEN MOBS OF SLAVES RANSACKED YOUR HALL?
TO MY ENEMIES, SOULS YOU GAVE,
I WILL NOT STAND TO BE BETRAYED!"

Mael was beset by unworldly pain
And his cries of mercy were all in vain.
BAL grasped the traitor in His hand
As the royal guards took one last stand.
Once-chained prisoners broke through the gate,
And soon Great Kuri met its fate.

What the Spider gained, none do know,
As Madame Webspinner lives in shadow.


Most of the names of the mentioned Magna Ge are titles, but are still useful nonetheless. Continue working on the damaged pages and we might find more. I need everything I can get on the slippery bastards.
