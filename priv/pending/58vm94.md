*The following is the transcript of a ceremonial rite of a cult dedicated to Boethiah located in Stonefalls, Morrowind in the Third Era*

O TRINIMAC, God of Self-Righteous Crusades, Remover of Hearts, Binder of Change, we defy you.

You took a scale from the Sleeping Dragon AKA, and scrimshawed it into an empty throne. You called this chair AURI-EL and when the other Et'Ada looked in wonderment, you claimed regency over the throne in the name of AKA, who slumbered in silence. For this THRONECARVING we DETEST you, to create a throne is ABOMINATION.

When the WORLD-BIRTH was complete, you named LORKHAN THE TESTER false where all could hear, though none of his words had been untrue. You tried him as an OATHBREAKER, though you had merely misheard the TRUTH of his words. You BOUND and UNMADE him, commanding AURI-EL to fling his HEART from CONVENTION.  

HE-WHO-DESTROYS and SHE-WHO-ERASES saw your FOOLISHNESS marked you as PREY for it. You were consumed in the fire that is BOETHIAH, the OATH-OAK forever burned to SMOLDERING ASH. Knight turned to Leper.

TRINIMAC-NO-MORE who is now MALACATH, we mock your misfortune. Brutalizer-and-Brutalized, Oppressor-and-Oppressed, we laugh at your ANGUISH. Always bleeding, never comprehending, your downfall was deserved by dint of its occurrence. 

FALLEN ONE, we DETEST you for your WEAKNESS.
