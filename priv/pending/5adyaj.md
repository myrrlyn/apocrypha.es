    So, this may be known elsewhere or maybe someone has come up with the idea, but I was reading on tonal architecture and I had a little idea pop into my head. 

So everything is made of music, it is made of tones. This means that each of the individual divine beings have their own melodies they weave or wove to create the world. My theory is that the two largest divine figures in the Creation, Akatosh and Lorkhan, while being space and time, are the opposites that hold Aurbis together and whole.

Lorkhan is often called the Doom Drum, as his name means in Ehlnofex (I believe.) In an orchestra or a symphony or a band, what keeps the music together? A percussion instrument, usually a drum. The drum serves as the baseline, creating the space on which all other elements may play and not be jumbled, one playing over one another. I believe that Lorkhan literally does this for the Aurbis and that his name references the fact that *he is a drum.*

Akatosh, on the other hand, is a cacophonous melody, allowing for other melodies and notes to play but there is no structure in it. Lorkan tricked everyone or convinced them to make the mortal plane and so bound them all to his rhythm. But who ordered them into a consensus? Because even with a rhythm it does not mean all the notes will fix. It was Magnus as he is known as the *Architect.* *The first tonal architect!*

Magnus arranged everything into order, becoming the Conductor of the Cosmos essentially. Lorkhan was the baseline, Akatosh was melody and all the other beings were just harmonies and thumping rhythms. So when this happened the Et'Ada began to die because of their attachment, their music was being rooted in Lorkhan's vision. Those who could escape, like Magnus and those who followed him (mainly I suspect because they knew the loopholes in the Symphony since they designed it), did. But everything settled with Lorkhan essentially binding the laws and Time itself into mortality, into one solid state so it could be linear.

That is why Lorkhan's heart cannot be destroyed in totality because it serves as the very *baseline* of all of existence. When Lorkhan himself died, the heart was his music and when Red Mountain became a Tower it acted like an amplifier for the music or maybe like a tuning fork? I am not sure. I just suspect that the Towers strengthen stability by acting like amplifiers for the stones' music. 

My last point is that Dragon Breaks, where Time becomes non-linear, could be a *skip* in the beat of the Doom Drum. The beat skips and so Time is momentarily freed. So, debunk me, tear me apart. I just had this thought while on the toilet and I just though maybe you all would like to hear it.
