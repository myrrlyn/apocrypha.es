The filthy child stood, features caked in sorrow and dirt.


I could not determine anything about the child, not sex, age nor intellect.


My captain said, “In this child I see great beauty.  We shall bathe her in my milk until she succumbs to the Four Corners.”

“You are safe, child.  I can take you to the Mother.”


I will never forget the visceral anger, fear and the utter relief on the face of the child.


She spoke, her voice a cracked whisper, too old for her tiny frame, “But are you safe, Muthsera?”
