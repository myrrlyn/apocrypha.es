I took the child to Mournhold, where the barren Velothi queen who ruled there was said to care well for foundlings.


When I saw her, I saw a fighter with a spear to match any in the land.  I loved her immediately, and I knew that if she loved something, then so would I.


At her right hand, was a husband of sorts, fussing silently over some kind of puzzle.


As we spoke of my journey with the still-dirt-caked child, the husband grew vexed with his puzzle and tossed it, it struck the child in the chest, and when it hit the ground, the solution was clear.


The barren Velothi queen shared a smile between all of us, proclaiming, “We are a family now.”
