The child has taken the name Vehk. 


I am adjusting to my life in Mournhold, as consort-champion to my Ayem.  She has spoken with Boethiah and believes I will be a great leader to the Velothi.


The court is dominated by priestly types, and I feel like a Dwarven Cacophony whenever my armour plates rub together, or my spear strikes the floor or my leg.


My preference is to be among the commoners, and learning directly from them.  I wish to give my voice to their words.


Voryn, of House Dagoth, has proven to be a welcome distraction from the spiritual patter that surrounds us.


Vehk often giggles that we are two comberries on a twig before flitting back between the shadows of the castle.
