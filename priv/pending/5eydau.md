&gt;**Recovered Texts from Devotees of Sheogorath, Vol. I**

&gt;***Ramos Valoran***

&gt;*Author's Note : This, my first encounter with the writings of Sheogorath's Cultists, was recovered from a nameless Bosmer. The poor fellow had climbed atop, and flung himself from, the Office of Imperial Commerce in the Imperial City's Market District. The following text was found tucked in the man's boot, tightly scrawled on a dried orange peel.*

&gt;Have you seen the waves? On the beach? The waves? Really seen them? Watch. They bounce, and loop, and push forward. Bounce, and loop, and forward. Smaller, smaller, washing away. Back in again and never stops.

&gt;I have seen the waves. Too many waves. The laughing endless waves. I laugh with them. But they know, they know. The waves. They're laughing AT me.

&gt;The waves are so funny. They're so clever aren't they? Wriggle, wrangle, flip-over-flop. Butterscotch. Fish sticks, fish sticks. Everywhere fish's ticks. Would the sweet one like a sweet roll?

&gt;Enough!

&gt;You're so weak! Dance and laugh! Make me forget! But you don't forget. And I remember again. You remember, too, don't you? Like rocks in the waves. And you remember too. Jigglyman is strong. Jyggalag strong and hard as rock. You jiggle Sheeegore. Bounce, and jiggle, and forward.

&gt;I jiggle, too. I giggle. When the tides come out and in, I giggle too. My laugh is strong and never stops. Hard as rocks, with waving all around.

&gt;Auntie Annie and Papa Paddy never got on did they? Hard as rock, and one was not, but no one ever laughing. Now there's lots. One made one and one, and one and one made four and more, and plenty to do the laughing. But Auntie never liked you, did she? Like Father like Son, like Granddad, like Grandson. Auntie HATES you!

&gt;I like it laughing, too. Love is the laughing. I love, but I'd like to stop. As hard as rock, as I am to not.

&gt;Shegorath guide me!
