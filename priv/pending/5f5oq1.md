The child is unique among Ayem’s charges, although it is only when undressed that anything seems different.


The child has memories of parents, a violent father, a netchiman fallen in with seafaring toughs.  A much-abused mother, who escaped only to die protecting the child from unscrupulous Dwemer, spies of a priesthood known for stealing children of magic.


And by Azura, Vehk has magic, even I can feel it.  Seht is particularly interested, and he says that this child is a cipher for all the codes hidden in the world.


The child is used to playing both as a boy and as a girl, as circumstances warrant.


By both measures, Vehk is beautiful.
