**Corruption and Conspiracy in the Imperial Guild of Mages, 3E 433**

*By Tertullian Arnelius*

**Introduction**

In the last year of the Third Era, the Guild of Mages was in turmoil. The sweeping reforms enacted by the new Arch-Mage, Hannibal Traven, had shaken the guild to its very core, and his famous ban on necromancy had resulted in the resignation of half the Council of Mages. The chaos only intensified when, in the midst of the Oblivion Crisis, the Mages Guild found itself at war with the ancient Order of the Black Worm and with Mannimarco, the King of Worms himself. In the ensuing conflict, all but one of Traven’s Council of Mages (including the Arch-Mage himself) lost their lives in mysterious circumstances, leaving the way clear for [REDACTED] to complete a truly meteoric rise to power by defeating the ancient lich and donning the robes of the Arch-Mage unopposed by the former leaders of the guild. 

The war against the Worm Cult is poorly documented and shrouded in mystery, with most of what we know being based entirely on the account of [REDACTED], the chief beneficiary of the string of mysterious deaths and chaotic events that unravelled in the last year of the Third Era. It is, then, our duty to pierce the veil and unravel the mystery surrounding the now-lionised [REDACTED], and explore the string of coincidences that led to the death of Hannibal Traven and his replacement by his protégé. 

---

We must first consider Hannibal Traven. While by no means a weak mage, Traven’s real skill was in the peculiarly Breton arts of politics and intrigue. With the help of a network of allies, spies, and informants, he was able to deftly manoeuvre himself into the Arch-Mage’s tower, and once there he continued to rule by subterfuge and the political management of people. While he was widely accused of abusing his position in pursuit of his own agendas and moral crusades, none would deny Traven’s ambition or impact. Once in power, Traven immediately set to reforming the guild. While constantly touting the legacy of Galerion, Traven imposed harsh restrictions on access to the Arcane University, and confined the cream of arcane resources to those who reached the university. He also made guild history (albeit a little late in the day) by banning outright the magical school of necromancy, or to use his phrase, the Black Arts.

The necromancy ban was met with fierce resistance when it was first proposed. Leading the defence of the discipline was Magister Ulliceta gra-Kogg of Orsinium, who after her defeat in the debate was promptly accused of being a necromancer. Members of the Order of the Lamp were dispatched to arrest her, despite the fact that necromancy was not a crime under Imperial Law and until that year had not even been formally forbidden by the guild. While gra-Kogg was able to escape Traven’s punishment, she was forced to live out her days as an exile, and a monument to the Arch-Mage’s ruthlessness.

When the ban came into force, half of the Council of Mages resigned in protest. This was of little concern to Traven; he replaced one resignation with the uncharismatic and unambitious Raminus Polus – a close ally and protégé of his – and had still not appointed a fifth member at the time of his death. Those who remained on the Council did not outlive him; both Irlav Jarol and Caranya died mysteriously in the wilderness, their fates witnessed only by [REDACTED]. But this was Traven’s war council against the necromancers. Their contributions in the conflict were limited at best; in true form Traven controlled all the information, receiving it from his network of informants (none of whom were subject to oversight by the Council) or from his chief agent, [REDACTED], who had risen rapidly through the ranks of the guild, always working for Traven whether directly or through his puppet, Polus. 

Every major action in the war against the Order of the Black Worm had one thing in common – the agency of [REDACTED]. When Wellspring Grove was raided and defiled, it was [REDACTED] who discovered and reported the crime, and purged the necromancers (all while still finding enough materials to receive a Mage’s Staff). When Mucianus Alias - the only one of Traven’s spies to come close to council oversight – vanished in the line of duty, it was [REDACTED] who tracked him down and reported his (un)death at the hands of necromancers. When the Bruma Guildhall was razed it was [REDACTED], once again, who reported the devastation and escorted the only survivor into Traven’s care (this survivor, a Khajiit named J’skar, disappeared soon after). Every new development regarding Mannimarco and his Worm Cult came directly from [REDACTED] or, it seems, from Count Janus Hassildor of Skingrad, now known to have been a vampire and a Mages Guild intelligence asset under Traven.

Following the destruction of the Bruma guildhall and the slaughter of its resident mages, Traven held a formal council deliberation (the first to be held in relation to the war with the necromancers). The full minutes of the meeting have, characteristically of Traven, never been found, but what is known is that immediately following this meeting, Magisters Jarol and Caranya fled the Arcane University, taking with them a band of supporters and a necromantic artefact each. 

According to Traven and [REDACTED], Jarol absconded with the Bloodworm Helm, hoping to protect it by taking refuge in the ruins of Fort Teleman in the Blackwood. Naturally, Traven’s favoured agent was dispatched to recover it. The picture painted in [REDACTED]’s report is a grim one – Jarol and his bound daedra made a last stand in the bowels of the fort. By the time [REDACTED] arrived, necromancers had overrun Jarol’s band and slain the Master Wizard. Yet the helm mysteriously remained and [REDACTED] was able to retrieve it from the deceased magister.

A similar but even more sinister tale is offered to explain the death of Magister Caranya. When she fled the city it was with the infamous Necromancer’s Amulet. According to [REDACTED], Caranya allowed Traven’s favourite to enter her stronghold in the Colovian Highlands, where she offered entry into the Worm Cult. Naturally [REDACTED] rejected her wicked offer and was attacked by the secret necromancer and her band of followers (all of whom, we are led to believe, were necromancers also, and took the time to *switch robes* and make their allegiance clear). [REDACTED] left Fort Ontus with another powerful artefact in hand and another Master Wizard dead in an abandoned ruin.

[REDACTED] now returned to Traven, and to a Council of Mages now consisting only of the Arch-Mage and his placid steward – a guild, effectively, in the hands of one man. What followed was even more shocking. Traven sent his agent on yet another mysterious mission, dispatching [REDACTED] to an Ayleid Ruin in pursuit of a mysterious “colossal black soul gem” in the hands of alleged necromancer and former guild chapter head Falcar. A team of battlemages assisted [REDACTED] but did _not_ follow into the ruins where Falcar and the mystery gem were hidden. What happened within is unclear, but [REDACTED] returned to Traven for the final time. 

According to [REDACTED]’s account, Traven then took the gem, named his agent as his successor, and promptly *took his own life*, soul-trapping himself in the gem in order to protect [REDACTED] from the sinister influence of the King of Worms. The workings of this magic have never been explained – Traven made no record of how he came to know about the gem, Mannimarco’s magic, or the spell by which he trapped his own soul. There is also no reliable record of the alleged correspondence between Traven and the rest of the guild, installing [REDACTED] as his official successor.

The alleged final showdown between [REDACTED] and Mannimarco follows a familiar pattern; the rising star ventured into the wilderness alone to assault the arch necromancer’s stronghold, slaying the ancient lich in single combat far from any watchful eyes. On [REDACTED]’s victorious return, the work done under Traven paid off; with Caranya and Jarol dead, there were no other viable candidates to succeed Traven. Polus lacked charisma, ambition, and force of personality, but had become an institution in the daily function of the guild, and so was able to lend officialdom to [REDACTED]’s appointment. Then-High Chancellor Ocato, himself a Master-Wizard of the guild, would have been a potential candidate if not for the Oblivion Crisis and his elevated responsibilities as High Chancellor. The only other Master Wizard left in the guild was Tar-Meena, keeper of the Mystic Archives, who was an eminent scholar but had no political following whatsoever, and had never taken part in guild business beyond her own sphere. Other figures like Carahil (head of the Anvil chapter and a key early supporter of Traven’s) were popular but distant, and thanks to Traven were outranked by [REDACTED].

So [REDACTED], an outsider completely unknown a year before, was able to sweep into the Arch-Mage’s tower unopposed. The guild had been totally gutted. The Council was functionally non-existent and the mages of the guild had been assured that the organisation had been saved only by the efforts of [REDACTED], their new, unquestioned Arch-Mage.

It cannot be proven that Arch-Mage Hannibal Traven cynically manipulated the blowback from his necromancy ban in order to create an atmosphere of emergency, assassinate his rivals, and seize control of the guild. It cannot be proven that the return of Mannimarco, ancient lich, was in fact an elaborate inflation of the truth – that a few disgruntled necromancers were retaliating against Traven’s ban. Lastly, it cannot be proven that [REDACTED] in fact followed along with Traven’s plan, assisted in his power grab by [REDACTED] in a series of un-witnessed tragedies, and finally [REDACTED]. 

All that can be said for certain is that in 3E 433, Arch-Mage Hannibal Traven took the Mages Guild to war against a shadowy enemy rarely encountered by anyone but [REDACTED]. Through his inflammatory policies, his management of people and information, and a series of deaths witnessed only by that same favoured agent, he eroded the power of the Council of Mages leaving himself alone at the top of the guild. And finally, in yet another mysterious death with only one witness, he died, leaving the way clear for [REDACTED] to replace him as Arch-Mage, presiding over a shattered guild with no Council and no credible rivals. Here it is the responsibility of all thinking citizens of the Empire to examine the facts, and look beyond the legend of [REDACTED], “hero of the Empire”.
