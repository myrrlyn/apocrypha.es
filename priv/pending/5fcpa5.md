I am truly and singularly blessed to have the love of my Queen.


Working tirelessly for months my Queen has helped me be named Hortator of House Indoril.  I have always known that the Queen of Mournhold was a devout follower of Boethiah, but truly the will of the Prince of Plots is personified by my Ayem.


In support of my new role, my brother-husband Seht has introduced me to a disciple of Azura, named Alandro of House Sul.  He is not well born, but he is of a practical mind and clear vision.  Seht has told me that Azura favours him greatly, and I would be wise to heed his advice.


My heart is swollen with gratitude.
