So lately I've been absolutely fascinated with Left Handers, the mystery within it.. marvelous, absolutely. Now I've read a lot of books and articles about this, and decided I'd compile this information to come out with a theory.

#**Lefthanders and Yokudans**

Before the Redguard came to be what they are, they used to be the Yokudans and co-existed with the Lefthanders in Yokuda, a fact we all know. Yokuda was very similar to Hammerfell, they were both dry arid deserts. Now the main point here is gonna be around Lefthanders and how much influence they exerted over Yokudans. 

 * First of all we know that Yokudans share a lot of with the Lefthanders, after all they taught them how to make Scimitars and Turbans, an important part of Redguard culture of course. Now what I really can't understand is how they "co-existed". This is a dark one, were the Yokudans on par with the Lefthanders? Were they *enslaved* by them (Highly unlikely?) ? Now my theory on this is that when the Yokudans arrived to Yokuda, the Lefthanders didn't enslave them like the Mer-Men of Tamriel, but instead adapted them into their society, and so the Yokudans became a distant but included part of the whole "Yokuda" society,

 * Which brings me to another point, why do the Yokudans hold such a view against Lorkhan? The Yokudans after all were part of the Wandering Ehlnofey, it is very strange that they'd hold this view, unless the theory about Lefthander influence is right? Let's take their northern cousins, Bretons. Originally humans who lived under Direnni influence for long enough that they adopted a pantheon similar to theirs and accepted the global Elven view on Lorkhan.

Now we pretty much got little to no information about their society, politics, culture or appearance, which I believe could've been very much related to Redguards, considering the traditional tenets of the Yokudan Empire in the equation. On their culture, I also believe it should've been very close/tied to that of the Redguards. I mean, we're talking about desert people here, city builders, to be more exact. There isn't a lot of possibilities for a distinct culture in a desert, no matter how hardy/endurant these people were, they'd still posses pretty much the same resources, and adding the fact that Redguards learned a lot from them in the equation reinforces it more. About their appearance, I'd like to believe they were purely yellow skinned mer, if not it would've been most likely really dark skinned Mer due to climatic reasons.

But the main concern is, magic. We know Yokudans/Redguards HATE magic, especially conjuration which they associate with alteration and illusion. I think it's easy to answer this one, perhaps Lefthanded magic was based off Conjuration, Alteration and Illusion? Well it definitely is anyways, based off it's description.

Let's not forget their name, "Lefthanded Elves" which probably means they wielded mainly with the left hands or maybe it had something related to force, as stated by Cyrus's sword meeting with Vivec.

#**Maormer**

I'm not gonna get too deep in this one, but the essential is they're a race of Mer mastering the art of sailing and they are also strong Snake mages. Their king Orgnum was an Aldmeri noble who got exiled for rebelling, he is believed to be immortals and he grows youthful by every century, add to that he is also believed to be Satakal, the Serpent god.

#**Satakal**

&gt;Satakal, the Worldskin, is the Yokudan god of everything, and a fusion of the concepts of Anu and Padomay (Satak and Akel), or the habitable universe resulting of their interaction, also called the Aurbis or 'The Gray Maybe'. Driven by hunger to eat one world to begin another, Satakal has much in common with the Nordic Alduin. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal has done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition, notably Ruptga, the first who learned how to do so. These spirits ultimately became the Yokudan pantheon. Satakal is a popular god of the Alik'r nomads. Redguard creation myth holds that they are doomed to mortality because they are very far away from the real world of Satakal, and the safe haven of the Far Shores is too far away for them to jump from the mortal world.

*Redguard religion*

#**Conclusions**

Obviously we can only theorize from this, but here's mine:

Maybe the Lefthanders worshiped Orgnum, believing he was the true Satakal? Of course it's not impossible that he is, but it's just highly unlikely. Many Redguards deny the fact that Orgnum is Satakal, so perhaps the Lefthanders did something really bad to piss the Redguards about it. It was so bad that they had to fight themselves to decide who's gonna lead, and it is also perhaps why Redguard divines were involved in this as in Orgnum tried to mantle him and the Lefthanders helped him which posed danger to them.
