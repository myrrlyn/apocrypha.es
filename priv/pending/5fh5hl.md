I didn't intend on creating a radical interpretation of Elder Scrolls lore, with the caveat that I also did not mean to take a strict humorous bent. It was my hope that a more realistic view on certain aspects of the lore could be achieved where Bethesda had chosen to remain overly vague.

That gravity exists seems to be a given, so no surprises there. May you forgive the fact that I chose a heliocentric perspective over the accepted geocentric nature of the Mundus, and a reliance upon realistic physics. Minor exaggeration has been employed with emotional response, and a few light-hearted jabs taken with the recent trend of attributing events or motives to more deific endeavors.

I'll welcome blistering criticism if that is warranted due to misreading potential in personal interpretations. I've also a handful of further ideas as to cultivate a more reality-based (or even grimdark) lens that would not (and should not!) deviate from the core nature of the franchise. I'll admit to a touch of hesitation in posting this here rather than seeking out a fanfiction subreddit, and as such I'll also welcome a suggestion that such ideas would find a more welcome reception thereabouts.

Perhaps you'll enjoy it, and I'm not alone in thinking the lore will tolerate a subjective tilt toward the primitive potential within the heroic fantasy.
