&gt; *Transcript Resumes:*

RosewingD: So... if we're not dead, *why* are we not dead?

Cariques: How should I know? I'm still getting used to the idea that I died.

RosewingD: Well, I think we can rule out conventional methods.

Cariques: There are conventional methods?

RosewingD: You know what I mean: Resuscitation, Raising, Resurrection...

Cariques: Yeah, I think I'd remember waking up in a clinic.

RosewingD: Or on an altar for that matter.

Cariques: That might depend on the altar of course. Know any quick tests for undeath?

RosewingD: You work in a temple - try getting someone to turn you.

Cariques: I work for Moth Priests. They have spells to drive off bookworm and dry rot, mainly. 

RosewingD: Let me see if ... Ow!

Cariques: Ow? 

RosewingD: Paper cut. If I'm undead, I'm not a "magical weapons only" type.

Cariques: Anyway, it's not so much like we came back to life; it's more as if we never died in the first place.

RosewingD: You thinking maybe a dragon break?

Cariques: Could be. Maybe we died, but someone changed time so that it never happened.

RosewingD: We didn't have any potential dragon breaking events on our watch list. Of course, it wouldn't be the first time something major flew under our radar.

Cariques: *cough*Oblivion Crisis*cough*

RosewingD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That never stops being funny.

Cariques: Anyway, whatever breaks the dragon, it doesn't need to happen now.

RosewingD: It doesn't?

Cariques: Dragon breaks rewrite history. Therefore it has to be something that happens in the future. It could be a long way into the future.

RosewingD: Of course, that's assuming that we are the important actors here.

Cariques: Well we have to be fairly close to the thread of events. People that weren't involved generally don't remember anything having changed.

RosewingD: So something we were about to do or that we are about to do was important enough to rewrite history to bring us back from the dead?

Cariques: Potentially, I suppose

RosewingD: Potentially? It's obvious! It must be the plan you were about to propose to solve the Dwemer problem!

Cariques: I, um, I suppose we can't rule that out...

RosewingD: So what was the plan? We have a second chance here! Let's get cracking!

Cariques: Well about that...

RosewingD: Yes?

Cariques: I, ah, I can't remember what it was.

RosewingD: What do you mean, you can't remember?

Cariques: There are gaps in my memory from just before ... you know.

RosewingD: You have got to be kidding me!

Cariques: It was all so clear... and then when I try to go there, it's just music.

RosewingD: Wait ... does it go sort of "la-la-lah la-la la-la-lah la-la-lah, la-la-lah la-la-lah la-la-LA!"

Cariques: Whoah! Don't go singing that!

RosewingD: What? Why not?

Cariques: There's a document in our archives about a priest who was traveling too fast when he hit Enlightenment and couldn't stop in time. We managed to catch a memospore transcript when he evaporated.

RosewingD: That sounds unpleasant, and yet oddly irrelevant.

Cariques: Rosey, his thoughts at the moment of his death were all in *music!* Worse, if you transcribe the music and get an  orchestra to play it, everyone that hears it also evaporates.

RosewingD: Y'ffre save us! I need another tune to get that one out of my head!

Cariques: You haven't heard the worst of it.

RosewingD: "A-doo-doo-doo, a-dah-daa-dah.."

Cariques: There's a note attached to the transcript:  apparently, it was only some fancy footwork with the Chim-El Adabal that contained that discorporation event to the people listening. 

RosewingD: "ta tum-ti tum-ti tum-ti-too" 

Cariques: It seems that particular recital came perilously close to unraveling the entire Empire.

RosewingD: ... wait, you think that's what happened to us?

Cariques: Well it could just be that our deaths are also capable of musical expression. Still it can't hurt to see if anyone accessed the vault containing the rapture weapons.

RosewingD: I'll check that. But that doesn't get us any closer to finding out what we're supposed to do.

Cariques: I got nothing at this end.

RosewingD: Why bring us back if we can't do the thing we were brought back to do? We are *so* screwed!

Cariques: Well, on the bright side, we're still here. So there's still time to do it, whatever it was.

RosewingD: Doesn't help much if we don't know what it was.

Cariques: Hey, maybe it's not us.

RosewingD: What do you mean?

Cariques: Well, the break could have been in the far future. Maybe it's not us that are the pivotal actors, but our descendants

RosewingD: What, both of our descendants? That seems quite a coincidence

Cariques: Not if they're the same people. Maybe the thing we need to do is to make babies together.

RosewingD: Not this again.

Cariques: Hey come on! We can save the universe and have fun at the same time.

RosewingD: Cariques, if the fate of the universe depends on us having sex, then the universe is just going to have to end.

Cariques: Hey, somewhere in the future it's already happened! 

RosewingD: It's *never* going to happen.

Cariques: You can't argue with history, babe.

RosewingD: Call me "babe" again and I'm going to take a steak knife and make sure you never father anyone, ever!

Cariques: I'll be round at your place in fifteen minutes, OK? Don't forget the ready meal and the mood music.

RosewingD: Jacko, I'm warning you...
