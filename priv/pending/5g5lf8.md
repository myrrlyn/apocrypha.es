**Nords, trust your blood!**


*By Almgrim Blood-Shield, 4E201*


To all the able Nords still in their farms, hamlets, and cities: arise! Do not allow the southern heretics to rule over you for any second more, take up arms, and head to the nearest camp of the noble Stormcloaks, to fight for your people, your nation, and your heritage! Remember even in your darkest hour that you are not a weak deceiver, like the southrons and the elves, but a hardy Nord, born from the race of muscle and steel! Through your veins flows the icy cold blood of Ysgramor, of Wulfharth, and even of Talos, the true man-born Ninth Divine! Remember even in the dead of night and the chaos of battle that hundreds of generations back, our people conquered these lands from those who wronged us, and remember stoutly that we will now reconquer it from those who have betrayed us! Is this land not ours? Is the cold not as natural to us as the sea is to fish and the air is to birds? Is the snow not as warm as a well-lit hearth to a true Nord? Nords everywhere, trust your blood, and join the only just cause in existence: join the armies of Ulfric Stormcloak, and rid us of the disease which has infected our lands. Your race wills it!
