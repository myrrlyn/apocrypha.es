Research on the Eye of Magnus

Kael Al'Reyn

The eye of Magnus, possibly the most powerful artifact in the mortal plane, other than the heart of lorkhan. It's believed that the name of the orb was given by the atmorans upon the realization of its power. But, why Magnus? Why would the atmorans connect this artifact to the architect? We must first look at the creation of the mortal plane. 


When lorkhan tricked the aedra into creating Mundus, Magnus was the chief architect, harnessing the powers of aetherius to create the laws of the mortal plane. However, upon achieving his work, he looked upon it with a great dismay. He had created a plane in which there would be insurmountable suffering and death, and a plan in which mortal subject would have free will. He fled Mundas, but his magical imprint on the plane had stayed. By traveling back to aetherius after the convention, a hole was torn through oblivion, letting the light of aetherius shine through to the mortal plane. Magnus had many et’ada followers, known as the magna ge. When Magnus himself fled, it's thought that all of the magna ge followed, ripping very small holes through oblivion, appearing as the stars. 


A leading theory, and one most accepted by scholars, is that the eye of Magnus was created shortly after the convention by Magnus himself. This theory posits a regulatory function of the magical imprint left by Magnus. Though no writings exist to support this theory, it's said that Magnus had anticipated the consequences of his presence on the mortal plane, and had created the eye to ensure that magicka would never be able to overwhelm the mortal plane and render it out of existence. However, several problems exist within this theory, most notably as an obvious contradiction in magnus’ supposed attitude toward the existence of the mortal plane. 


The theory I'm proposing would move the date of creation of the orb forward by a few hundred years, at the hands of the last Magna Ge to walk Nirn, and as a direct request from Magnus. It's very likely Magnus still had a hand in the eye’s creation in the form of a part of himself. 


In the writings of Dranor Seleth, specifically in “Night of Tears”, it is suggested that the reasoning for the snow elf attack on Saarthal was indeed to secure this thing discovered by the atmorans. I hold it to be true that the function and purpose of existence was known only to ancient Dwemer and Falmer civilizations. My research in Skyrim has brought me to multiple Dwemer ruins but yielded nothing pertaining to the orb or its function. However I've managed to track down the last known being to lay eyes on it, the Dragonborn. 


A few decades ago, the eye was uncovered in the ruins of Saarthal with the help of the Dragonborn and the college of winterhold. According to the dragonborns account, the calamity ended when a member of the Psijic order appeared to transport the orb back to Artaeum, which at this point had vanished a century beforehand. This was the second time that Artaeum had seemingly vanished from existence. Also involved with the orb was a thalmor agent, suggesting the Aldmeri Dominion still has a use for the object, or at least knows of it immense amount of power. 


If the Eye of Magnus was indeed created by the Magna Ge, using or encapsulating a  piece of Magnus, is this the object that allows magic to function within the mortal plane? Some would say the fact that the Psijic Order were able to transport the eye without consequence is proof that this theory is false, however, magic flows through all planes, mortal or otherwise. An object with magical influence upon Mundus will have the same magical influence in Oblivion, so long as the object is powerful enough. It could be that the orb is way to contain and harness the power of the et Ata. In other words, the eye of magnus is to the piece of magnus contained within it, as the tools of kagrenac are to the heart of lorkhan, a tool with which to harness the power of an et’Ada.


Perhaps, if my theory rings true, it was best for the Eye of Magnus to be taken and guarded by the Psijic order, away from the corrupting touch of mortals within Mundus. Nirn should take solace in the fact that they are now protected from undesirable mortals achieving CHIM. My research into the eye will not cease. I have texts that seem to point in the direction of Summerset Isles, this will be my next journey.
