Presented to His August Majesty, Emperor Titus Mede II and his Elder Council, 4E 200, Midyear 11

As per your specific request, I have made a thorough review of our military assets in the Nibenay valley, as well as the strategic assessment of the river itself. 
 
*[a meticulous catalogue of military assets, garrison strengths, warships, emergency food stores, contingency plans, etc. follows]*

One glaring weakness in our defense of the river lies in the inadequacy of patrols along the upper and lower Niben. I needn't remind anyone that during the Great War, the Dominion enjoyed unimpeded access up the waterway after the surprise attack upon the fleet at Topal Bay. Leyawiin, Bravil and the Imperial City itself may have been able to hold out weeks longer had they been resupplied from the Niben. 

Few warships are stationed year-round at the Imperial City docks on Lake Rumare, while the bulk of our fleet is based out of Topal Bay. The only regular patrols along the Niben river and bay are conducted by galleys, with typically less than a dozen fighting men aboard each. These might seem adequate in peacetime, but we require a force that can repel interlopers attempting to navigate upriver, as well as reinforce the defenses anywhere along the river's course. Our standard naval carracks have difficulty maneuvering in shallower water, and it would be unwise to divert them away from the Topal Sea Fleet. Rather than reassigning existing ships to the river, I purpose that your majesty commission the construction of a fleet of mid-size, shallow-draft vessels, fitted with oars and sails, carrying a compliment of at least fifty legionaries. Each of these Dreugh-class ships (my suggested appellation) would be armed with two ballistae, fore and aft, and at least two battlemages. These vessels would be equally capable in ship-to-ship combat, boarding actions or coming ashore to deploy troops inland. The Dreugh ships would not replace the existing galleys, but compliment them and lead their patrols. I have discussed the matter with a naval shipwright and she believes that such warships could be constructed at the Bravil shipyards, provided enough timber and skilled labor. 

Your Humble Servant, Mercator Decanius, General of the 2nd Cyrodiil Legion, Commander of the Upper Niben District.

**P.S.** I have mentioned this before, informally, but I will take the opportunity of this report to submit it in writing. I believe the traditional names of Fort Grief and Fort Irony are harmful to the garrisons' morale. I know there is a storied tradition dating back centuries or some such, but I would rather they were rededicated with the names of the legion's heroes from the Great War.
