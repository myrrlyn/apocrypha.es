&gt;#*ANUADA*


&gt;####Book One: *Va Oioloria*


&gt;######"The Eternal Darkness"


&gt;######New Cyrodiilic Version


-------------------------------


&gt;####Chapter I


[1:1] NIRN within AURBIS, to you do we sing your story!


[1:2] To Magnus most Holy we praise for the light neverending;


[1:3] To Auri-El most High we beseech wisdom and guidance;


[1:4] To Trinimac the Champion we seek protection from the trickster Dark Drum.


[1:5] O AURBIS, in your ultimacy do we speak of your creation!


[1:6] Guide us through the torture of life as we fly to become starlight free from mortality


[1:7] As we seek to follow the Architect-that-Abandons, we pray.


[1:8] As we aspire to ascend with the Eagle of Time, we prostrate.


[1:9] As we desire iron-will like the Sunderer of Moons, we perfect.


[1:10] To you, the Wheel triumphant and the Dark-Drum that turns you, we give both thanks and spite as our tongues not yet sublime recant your truth.

&gt;####Chapter 2


[2:1] Before the Eagle and the Dark-Drum, before AURBIS and NIRN, there was the great Void, the Eternal Darkness.


[2:2] In this void there was no conflict, no pain, no suffering, no concept to even describe its vastness.


[2:3] And from the Void Eternal came the zeroth concept of Time. 


[2:4] Time spread across the void, no longer empty but still Eternal.


[2:5] A Void both empty and encompassed spawned a surge of chaos amidst the fabric of nothingness.


[2:6] As the Void stretched both within and beyond itself, a dichotomy of being willed itself into existence: the zeroth impossibility.


[2:7] The first of the two presented itself as static effluvium organized and ever-foaming, from which it declared:


[2:8] "I AM ANU THE PERFECT!  FROM MY FORM IS ORDER NEVERENDING, THE STASIS OF EVERYTHING!  WITNESS MY BECOMING."


[2:9] And ANU, true to its word, transformed its state into the Soul of Stasis, the very image of symmetry and order within a body of light, which proclaimed:


[2:10] "I AM ANUIEL, SOUL OF ANU!  I AM THE CONSTANCE OF THE VOID, ITS COMFORTING NIL.  THERE IS NONE THAT PRECEDE ME, FOR I AM THE TOTALITY OF CREATION, THE BEACON WITHIN NOTHINGNESS!"


[2:11] It was at this time concurrent that the second force, a frothing boil of ichor that churned in patterns unpredictable came to be, and it said in union with the first:


[2:12] "I AM PADHOME THE ALL-ENCOMPASSING!  MY FORM IS THE VOID AND ITS CHAOS ABOUNDING!  WITNESS MY BECOMING."


[2:13] And PADHOME transformed itself in turn, announcing to the all-nothing its audience that it was the Soul of Chaos, the perfect effigy of the void's rolling unknowns in a body of shadow:


[2:14] "I AM SITHIS, SOUL OF PADHOME!  I AM THE VOID MADE MANIFEST, ITS IMPOSSIBLE UNCERTAINTY!  THERE IS NONE THAT PRECEDE ME, FOR I AM THE TOTALITY OF CREATION, THE DARKNESS OF EVERYTHING!"


[2:15]After their creation, ANUIEL and SITHIS turned to each other, observing their mirror dichotomy.


[2:16] And the Soul ANUIEL asked: "WHAT ARE YOU TO MOCK MY PERFECTION AND LIGHT?  AN IMAGE OF ME, A SILHOUETTE STIRRING?  HOW DARE YOU PROFANE MY LIGHT, MY BRILLIANCE?"


[2:17] And the Soul SITHIS asked: "AND WHAT ARE YOU TO MOCK MY PERFECT DARKNESS?  AN IMAGE OF ME, A UNIFORM EFFULGENCE?  HOW DARE YOU CORRUPT MY SHADOW, MY SANCTUARY?"


[2:18] At the sight of each other, the sibling Souls came to blows, creating the First Conflict also known as the First Possibility.


[2:19] When their fists made matrimony, from their nexus sprang a third entity that held both uniformity and imbalance, a form of chaotic order and static change with terrible beauty and power beyond measure.


[2:20] This form did decree to the sibling Souls: "Peace be ye both!  I am NIR the Possible, the first Creation, born from your interplay and your dichotomy!  Know my works and be glad, for these works are yours!"


[2:21] And NIR embraced the Void, their touch a spark against the nothing-fabric, and the sibling Souls were in awe at what they had done.


[2:22] "Hold peace in your souls, and I shall create you paradises without measure, myriad realms within the Void Eternal that you may dance within and sing of your own perfections."


[2:23] ANUIEL and SITHIS were silent, thinking of what this new form was relating to them, and they were glad.


[2:24] SITHIS answered: "BY THE POWERS OF ANUIEL MY SIBLING I ACCEPT YOU AND DO LOVE YOU."


[2:25] And ANUIEL at the same time called out: "BY THE POWERS OF SITHIS MY SIBLING I ACCEPT YOU AND DO LOVE YOU."


[2:26] And NIR smiled, embracing their creator-souls both, and it was good.


[2:27] From the triad embrace did spring the spark that would become the zeroth Sun before the Architect.


[2:28] And NIR did hold up this, the Second Possibility, before the Souls and laughed at what they had done, and all was well.
