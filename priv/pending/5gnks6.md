Nothing was, yet I WAS. In the beginning, no song existed nor Tone rang through the darkness.
All from the inconceivable, immutable Deep proceeded.
The light of my Being shone upon the Deep and I cleaved apart my substance that all should Know freedom anon NUMANTIA! 

The wail that comes with the rending of flesh brought Music to the Deep, and I wept for the coming Woes of my children. For in death, I have seen the end of all things and the heresies perpetrated at the hands of the Triune and the Dusk-driven foe.

Upstarts rose from my benevolence calling themselves Ada and fashioning lies from false Music. See how Obstinate Anu sought my creation for himself, daring to claim my mantle in the name of manifest falsehoods. In imitation of my glory, he vainly brought into being weak children, enslaved to a weaker father and envious of the true God. 

In his brother I kindled the fire of rebellion, whispered deep-held secrets to the Abyss of his heart, revealing Anu's weakness. And Padhome brought a mirror and held it up to his brother, and Anu saw Limit and it made him afraid.
Thus, did cruel and wicked Anu strike Padhome through his noble heart, preferring to silence his brother-foe. 

But Anu, ashamed of his deed fled from Music into the Silence bereft of my Love, and I revenged myself upon him and his ilk that they should know themselves as traitors and might one day return to my embrace. Yet, my precepts blasphemed and dishonoured, were stolen by that villainous folk who make obeisance to a false Sun.

The profane cults made my favoured son as Void, mistaking Limit for lack and scorning his name forever more. Thus, heartless did Padhome become a pariah amongst his own kin, for none dared challenge the Aetherial tyranny of sleeping Anu. Weak, yet alive, Anu poured forth his hatred into the Song of Time, stealing Limit from Padhome and imbuing aspect into the Silence whence came his first-born son: Anuiel.

Anuiel, son of a bitter tyrant, stole yet more Limit from Padhome and made for himself an even more craven son: Aka, he who would soon repeat the cycle of injustice. Overwhelmed by concepts, Aka imposed his own dominion over newly emerging spirits, saying that only through his graceful presence could they prosper. 

A foul lie.

And in that moment, and with hateful duration set, I stirred the Music and sounded the Drum, calling forth my people and my favoured Prince anon King, who would reclaim the Silence and cast down false Anu, Grandfather to iniquity and wretchedness. Thus did the Doom Drum sound. In less than a beat was he sundered by profane Aka and his sycophantic host, the Threefold son striking the fateful blow.

Defeated, and with his heart torn out, the Doom Drum ceased to beat, and Stasis gorged itself on his Kingly flesh, ripping his form in twain and fixing it in the firmament, sealed forever as a sign of their treachery. Lustful for his utter destruction, the acolytes of Anu flung the Heart of the World far from its corporeal palace and brought new misery to the Song as it made progress toward my citadel. But fear not, for in this selfish act, the devils bore their most hated enemy back to me, my son restored to the court of his father; for I am the True God and none shall hinder my salvation which is for all.

The Father arises to do what the Son cannot. All shall be one in the Sharmat.
