Well, okay then. The "Uutak Mythos Bible" is officially done. Now you can know the complete history of the Uutak Mythos itself, how to talk like the Echmer with an incomplete Echi Lexicon, the archipelago of Yneslea itself, the complete timeline to the events of Yneslea, and so much more. It's a bit of a long read at around 146 pages, and it took me awhile to complete it (I don't think I'll be writing any more Uutak/Echmer texts any time soon), but I'm glad I did. It's available as a doc on Google Drive, but be free to download it at your leisure if you wish to read through it.

I want to thank everyone that has ever helped with or showed interest in the Uutak Mythos (there's something special in the UMB, just for you), and I'm glad that the Echmer have gotten mostly a positive reception for the last two years. And remember to drink your ovaltine.

With that being said, [hobey-ho, let's go.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13y6nkaFenfu8BYW4S271k6SVq_3Uw4JmID1FAyTBJPE/edit?usp=sharing)
