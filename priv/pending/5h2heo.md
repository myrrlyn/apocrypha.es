The child, Vehk, grows quickly.  In body and magic, we can see maturity hardening the set of jaw and shoulders, the youthful face giving way that of a pensive and studious young adult.


I feel my age, surrounded by such otherworldly beauty.  Even my Ayem only seems to grow younger and more radiant as the seasons pass.  My brother-husband, Seht, has reminded me that age means nothing when the seas of Padhome consign our stories to the Mnemoli, and our secrets to Hermaeus Mora.  He says every day he prays to Azura, so that dusk may fall on our ambitions, and dawn may shine on our achievements.


I was somewhat surprised that he prays at all.  He laughed, and said that there is no harm in reaching out to spirits, as long as we do it right.
