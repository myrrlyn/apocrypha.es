*With anger in our hearts we sail  
To melt the snow with our fire  
Five Hundred make way through the waves*

*We make landing on the rocky shores  
All ships arrived, save one  
I row against the tide to battle the Sea*

*Storms force me back to the coast  
Gales and darkness that seem unending  
For two fortnights we wait*

*The storm breaks at last  
Our kinsmen returned, yet lost  
For the Sea had claimed their souls*

*We choke back our tears  
As our hopes wash up on the shores  
Leaving only ghosts*

I wrote this interpretation of *Yngol And The Sea-Ghosts* a few months ago for a TES-inspired musical project I've been procrastinating on. Nothing groundbreaking, but I figured I'd share regardless.
