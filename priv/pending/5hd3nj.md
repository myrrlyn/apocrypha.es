The New Theorists are a neovehkian order dedicated to "reaching violence by heaven" which they believe will ultimately bring about some sort of transcendental liberation of society as a whole.

The group first came to public attention when they claimed responsibility for the introduction of a powerful aphrodisiac into the water supply of the Talos Plaza District and the subsequent outbreak of what has been euphemistically referred to as "public disorder". They are also thought to be responsible for a number of uses of the notorious Stark Reality spell originally developed by Third Era sanguinistas.

Members of the public are advised that membership of the New Theorists is illegal under Imperial Law and that any contact with the group should be reported to the authorities at the earliest opportunity.

Editor's Note: 

It should perhaps be mentioned that the term "Theorist" is used here in a strictly Mephalaic sense, presumably on the assumption that anyone familiar with the writings of the Urvehk will understand the deeper meaning.
