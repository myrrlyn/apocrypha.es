&gt;#*ANUADA*


&gt;####Book One: *Va Oioloria*


&gt;######"The Eternal Darkness"


&gt;######New Cyrodiilic Version

------------------------

&gt;####Chapter 3


[3:1] Thus it was in the Void Eternal that NIR the Possible conferred with Soul ANUIEL and Soul SITHIS to shape their darkness into perfection.


[3:2] By the powers of inspiration, the sibling-souls did bestow their Possibility with a kiss upon NIR's ethereal cheeks.


[3:3] From the meeting of their lips did bloom two spheres of influence in effigy of their makers.


[3:4] The first was the epitome of Order absolute; a thought that could constantly be ineffable, never changing its perpetual brilliance in miasma.


[3:5] And it was so that ANUIEL proclaimed: “BEHOLD, DEAR SPIRIT, THIS CONCEPT OF MY MAKING, THE EVER-CHANGING STATIC OF ORDER!”


[3:6] The second was Chaos inertia; a realm that organized itself, the cacophony in the act of attempted organization, forever needing to be categorized, forever making itself impossible.


[3:7] And it was so that SITHIS proclaimed: “BEHOLD, DEAR SPIRIT, THIS CONCEPT OF MY MAKING, THE CONSTANT ABYSS, THE CHAOS ETERNAL!”


[3:8] ANUIEL sighed and so followed SITHIS, and they decided to give their newest action a name.


[3:9] “FROM THE AETHER OF MY SOUL, I DECLARE THIS TO BE *AETHERIUS*” called out ANUIEL to their sibling soul.


[3:10] “FROM THE NOTHING OF MY SELF, I DECLARE THIS TO BE *OBLIVION*,” echoed SITHIS.


[3:11] It was so that NIR exclaimed, “By the mingling of our powers did we make this all, and we shall cherish this place forever more.”


[3:12] “For myself,” NIR did continue, “I shall take the Penumbra and the overlap; a place in-between yet to become that I may gift you many realms for your pleasure.”


[3:13] And the three did agree to this, their works complete and unfinished, the task at hand only beginning but already ending, and it was good.

&gt;####Chapter 4


[4:1] This is the story of the alien trees that pierced the Outside and intruded itself upon the three-headed paradise of the sibling souls and the possible; this is start of the schism, the end that begins again.


[4:2] And so it was that NIR lectured: “Remember dear souls that made me, these are not the realms I promised you, merely the idea in which they would inhabit.”


[4:3] By which the Souls did protest in union, “BUT FOR OUR POWERS DID WE CREATE THIS BY OUR LOVE, OUR LOVE FOR YOUR EXISTENCE, OUR LOVE FOR YOU.”


[4:4]  NIR did place their hands upon the cheeks of ANUIEL and SITHIS, and in doing so imparted a lesson of great importance.


[4:5] “Your powers, dear Souls, were the reflections of your own selves upon your creation, not an act of love.  **I** am an act of Love most true, that pointed moment of fists clashing in conflict.”


[4:6] “The Love of your Wills is the conflict of your existence, and through this conflict does your affections manifest as they have done in Me.  Know Me, and behold your Love for each other.”


[4:7] As ANUIEL the Static and SITHIS Chaotic recoiled at this revelation, there came a resounding crackle through the Void Eternal, a staid sensation ripple that was foreign and strange even for this intangible place.


[4:8] Thus did appear before the Souls a cluster-collective of branch and bark: things that did not yet exist in this place and time.  


[4:9] These manifestations of tree beings did speak before the triad: “*be not afraid for we are here in refuge of the end that begins anew that always is.*”


[4:10] And NIR in curiosity asked, “What are you, gentle beings?” 


[4:11] “*we are hist and we are here*” was their reply, the voice of their monotony echoing across the Void, penetrating the core of each Soul’s being.


[4:12] In discomfort, ANUIEL retorted: “YOU INTRUDE UPON OUR SANCTITY AND REQUEST REFUGE?  OUR REFUGE IS IN OUR TRI-CORNERED SELF; THERE IS NO PLACE IN OUR REALITY FOR YOU.”


[4:13] The Hist replied in kind: “*reality is a peculiarity to grasp for the egg that becomes the many heads within the sun.*


[4:14] Their response failed to satisfy ANUIEL, confusing them in excess, thus they spake: “I HAVE BUT ONE HEAD AND ONE SOUL.  I AM ONLY WITHIN MYSELF, BECOMING MYSELF, FOR I AM ME AND I AM ONE.  YOU FOOLISH BRAMBLE, SPEAK NONSENSE AGAIN, AND I SHALL PUNISH YOU.”


[4:15] “PEACE, ANUIEL SOUL OF ANU,” bade SITHIS.  “THEIR SPEECH MOST STRANGE INTRIGUES ME AND I WISH THEM TO CONTINUE.  GO ON.  ENLIGHTEN ME AND MY SIBLING SOUL, I DARE YE!”


[4:16] Though not interested in the goading of the Soul of PADHOME, the Hist did enlighten ANUIEL of their meaning. 


[4:17] “*we are unaware of time as it affects you and is affecting you as we do speak young soul we are beyond you and before you within you and without you and what we do know is that you are the shatter-god of many heads with birds and lizards and beasts and fangs and hunger and humanity this is you and your becoming why do you fight it*”


[4:18] Headached by the nonsense of the Hist and their streams of conscious words, ANUIEL did protest: “YOUR WORDS ANNOY ME!  I AM NOT A SHATTERED GOD BUT A WHOLE ENTITY!  DARE YOU PROFANE ME IN MY EXALTATION!”


[4:19] “I BELIEVE THE HIST WORDS RING WITH PORTENT, ANUIEL.  PERHAPS WE SHOULD HEED AND BEWARE OUR FATES.”  But SITHIS could not console the Soul ANUIEL.


[4:20] “SILENCE, SITHIS!  TO YOU WILY AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE THINGS, BEGONE!  WITNESS YOUR EXODUS!”


[4:21] And with great force did ANUIEL kick the Hist out of sight, far into the concept-voids of the Soul of PADHOME.


[4:22] In reaction did the ideas that swathed through Oblivion cradle the Hist, the will of SITHIS giving comfort to the tree-forms.


[4:23] “THOUGH MY SIBLING DOES YOU GREAT DISHONOR, I AM ELATED IN WELCOMING YOU IN MY CONCEPT, MY OBLIVION.”


[4:24] The Hist, not ignoring SITHIS and their kindness, told in plain: “*though we are in an understanding we know this does not matter for the violence of your sibling that is also you creates a world for us to inhabit we wish nothing more than to float in this void where the great change happens*” 


[4:25] “THOUGH I HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR MEANING,” remarked the soul, “I DO ALLOW YOU REFUGE HERE.”


[4:26] Then it was that SITHIS and the Hist would be idle in their own Void, leaving ANUIEL in a confusing brood.

[4:27] "THAT THING MADE NOTHING SENSIBLE WITH ITS WORDS, DEAR NIR!  HOW COULD I TOLERATE IT WHEN IT COULD NOT BE DISCERNED?"

[4:28] Though alas, dear NIR was in awe at the spark of the Zeroth Sun that would Become, holding it up before ANUIEL.

[4:29] "Know that no thing, no confusion, no agony, shall keep you from your Will so long as you hold it in your Soul, ANUIEL.  Look to this spark of our triangled creation and know my meaning."

[4:30] The comfort of NIR's few words did ring true into ANUIEL, tossing aside the Hist's string of knowledge, deciding instead to admire with NIR the spark.

[4:31] The ignorance of the Soul of ANU would be the downfall of the triad and the truth of Hist.  

[4:32] In observation, the Hist did ponder: "*the many-head soul looks to their egg in wonder do they know their fate after all*"

[4:33] So the End Began.
