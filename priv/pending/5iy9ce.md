*I am the Lore Master (not really the best Lore "Master", but I digress) for the modding team Akavir-Calling. We are going to be adding the continent of Akavir into the game. We are still at the conceptualization and recruitment phase, so not much I can say on that topic.*

*Anyways, main point, I am also going to be writing quite a few of the Akaviri books for the project and have just finished the rough draft of my second one. Names will be added and the writing style may change depending on how how the team decides the Tsaesci are going to be like, but I would love some input from you guys here. As an fyi, the mod is, as of now, going to run off the idea that the Kamal and Nords are both descended from the Atmorans, just Atmorans who landed on different continents. This is a rough draft.*

*It is 1 of X for now as I do not know how many reports will be in the mod.*

(written by the Tsaesci)

I have returned from the third archaeological dig in the Elder Woods.

The purpose of this particular dig was to research the architecture of the continent.

It seems as if some of the soldiers who returned from Tamriel found similarities between the Nordic and Kamalic architecture.

Furthermore, from what we know of both of their traditions they both claim to have come from the continent to the north, what is known as the Elder Woods.

The purpose of this dig was to find out what similarities exist between the architecture of all 3 areas.

What we discovered is that there is, in fact, similarities between all three places.

While what information I have of Nordic architecture is currently limited, it does seem as if there are more differences between the Nordic and Kamalic architecture than between each of their architecture and the structures we found in the Elder Woods.

While I do believe that this is significant and may indeed prove that they both come from the same people, other areas must first be studied.

We found what appears to be a temple in the Elder Woods and, in the forth dig, we will excavate it and study it in more depth.

We will then compare what we have found with the religions of both the Kamal and the Nordic Men.

Before we can do this, however, we need to gather more information on the religious beliefs of the Nordic Men.
