*Found amongst the gathered writings of the Moth Priests of the northern Cyrodiil sanctuary, this poem is written in the familiar, carefully exact scrawl of moth priests who have gone fully blind.*

*It has been dated to 4E 81, the same year as Brother Furioso's final reading of the Elder Scrolls.*

.

Life has crushed my fantasies.

.

Bring canticle bark burnt for moth magicry,

to shine a light into the eternities,

losing sight of what is now in front of me.

But why would this be your one only decree?

For you we dance like flames without vanity,

with flame's same mortality, only hoping,

hoping to stay alight in aetherial flight,

but now I'm just a candle trying to stay lit

in this windy night, oh, this windy night, no...

.

Got to crush my fantasies of how this life

is supposed to be, how it's supposed to be.

.

Bring my broken mind up to invisible 

kings with a hope one day they might answer me,

and so I do pray, do not abandon me.

.

Your silence,

.

it kills me.

.

Could it be any other way?

.

Is it wrong to think you might speak to me?

You might speak, would it be words? and what would you say?

What *could* you say?

.

It's so heavy.

.

It's so heavy,  

.

A heavy price to pay.

.

The darkness.
