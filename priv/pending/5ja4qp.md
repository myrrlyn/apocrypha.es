'Neath fire and ash

I wait for you

Eternities of darken'd slopes



The Heart asks why

I love you, how

Betrayal dark may feed my hopes



It speaks, incessant

Veins of thought

Tendrils red and silver-tongued



I mustn't doubt

You will return

Although the way is many-runged



Millenia have passed

It seems

Since 'way our foes had crying gone



Blade and chant

Carved sword and word

Our blood, together, we had drawn



I'll ne'er forget

Our closeness then

The fires in my chamber lit



So turn your tools

Upon my Heart

And bring Wraithguard, I have need of it
