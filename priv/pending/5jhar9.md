As Vehk grows and changes, we grow concerned.  Several times now, Vehk has vanished from the castle, returning days later, covered in dirt and blood, stinking of belly-magic and rage.

Ayem’s charges lack for nothing, they are given food, clothes, education, even money to spend on themselves.  Yet...This is not enough for Vehk.

Ayem and Seht, who are most involved in the raising of Vehk, are at a loss of what to do.  Vehk is unlike any child under their care.  My official duties often have me far away from Mournhold, and I am unsure if Vehk would even listen to me.

Voryn has suggested that an apprenticeship at the Temple of Mephala may be able to offer the depth and structure that Vehk seems to need.  Alandro suggests that Voryn’s advice is inevitable, whatever that means.

I hope Ayem is in a mood to listen tomorrow.
