**Saturday Morning Vivec.**
=======================
**Episode Two: The Many Headed One.**
=================================



**Page One:**
=========

Panel One:
----------

Big Panel. Inside the storeroom at the Farmers and Labourers Hall. Vehk Indoril sits on a large long crate with his head in his hands looking glum. The box has has the episode title "The Many Headed One" written on it's sides. Other similar boxes are stacked around him, their stickers suggesting they are from an archaeological expedition. There are labels saying things like "Nerevar Expedition: Red Mountain" and maybe some less serious comments/graffiti, like "Fragile (LOL!)" or "Danger: Spikey!".

Fedura Sethan is there and is trying to cheer Vehk up.

**Fedura**: What's the matter, **Vehk**? Why the long face?

**Vehk**: **Serjo Ildram** wants me to clear these old crates out of here, but I don't have anywhere else to store them.

**Fedura**: "**Nerevar**". That was your **father's** name, wasn't it?


Panel Two:
---------

Close up on Vehk, looking glum.

**Vehk**: These are the **artefacts** from his last expedition to **Red Mountain.**

**Vehk**: He gave his **life** to save **mine**, and this is all I have **left** of him

Panel Three
-----------

Looking past Vehk to Fedura who looks sympathetic.

**Vehk**: I wouldn't mind so much if they were going to be **studied**, or **exhibited** ...

**Fedura:** Well, there must be **someone** that wants them! A **school** or a **university** maybe?

**Vehk:** I suppose there must be.

Panel Four:
----------

Vehk looking almost hopeful, Fedura steering him towards the door, almost pushing him.

**Fedura:** Well let's go and **knock** on some **doors**!

**Vehk:** But...

**Fedura:** **Come on!** It'll be **fun**!

**Page Two:**
=========

Panel One:
----------

St Delyn Canton, upper walkway. Vehk and Fedura. Both look a bit tired, Vehk looks a bit happier than on the previous page. More because of Fedura's company than anything else.

**Vehk:** I'm **beat**. We've been walking **forever**!

**Fedura:** Now don't give up! I'm sure there's a **museum** around here **somewhere**.

Panel Two:
----------

Fedura waving to attract the attention of a passing ordinator. Vehk looks understandably dubious.

**Fedura:** Why don't we ask an **ordinator?** Oh, **Ordinator!**

**Vehk:** Fedura...

**Fedura:** **Ordinator!**

Panel Three:
------------

Fedura has the ordinator's attention

**Ordinator:** Citizen.

**Fedura:** Do you know where ...

Panel Four:
-----------

This is a narrow space between panels 4 and 6 and is basically a big sound effect.

**SFX: FZZZAAK!**

Panel Five:
-----------

Same scene, but the ordinator has been replaced with a Dremora.

**Fedura:** A **Dremora!**

**Vehk:** What?

**Dremora:** **Remain Calm Mortals. There Will Be. An. Announcement.**

Panel 6:
--------

Wide Panel. We're on the upper walkway at St Olms looking towards the railing. The dremora is standing, very much "on duty", Vehk is asking questions forgetting for a moment that he's in his mortal identity. The dremora is pretty much ignoring Vehk. Meanwhile, Fedura is trying to get Vehks attention and point out something happening below. The other half of the panel is empty except for a big sound effect in the sky.

**Vehk:** **Announcement?** What **Announcement?**

**SFX:** People of **Vivec City!**

**SFX:** Your **Attention** Please!



**Page Three:**
===========

Panel One:
----------

Wide panel. Looking down from the walkway on High Fane. The POV is is if the reader was leaning on the railing, and at the edges we can just about see Vehk and Fedura looking down so it's as if the reader was standing between them.

Way down below, on the steps of High Fane someone is addressing the city through a PA system. Except that there isn't a PA system, he's just shouting, very, very loudly. From the vantage in this panel, he looks very small and we
can't make out a lot of details.

**SFX:** **Vivec City** is Under **New Management**.

**SFX:** There's a **New Ruling King**: **Me!**

**SFX:** So everyone **stay cool**, and we can all have a **good time** today.

**Fedura (small):** How can anyone **shout** so **loud?**

**Vehk:** **Oww!**

Panel Two:
----------

Vehk has slumped down and is sitting on the floor, his back against the railing (it's more of a low wall, but I'm not sure what to call it really). He looks to be in pain. Fedura has crouched down, worried about Vehk. Above the railing the public address continues.

**SFX:** Also, try not to tease the **Dremora**. They're just **temporary** until...

**Fedura: Vehk!** What's **wrong?**

**Vehk:** I ... don't know! My **head** ... **splitting!**

Panel Three:
------------

Fedura peers closely at Vehk, looking worried.

**Fedura:** It looks like you're having some sort of **attack**.

**Fedura:** **Stay there!** I'll find someone to **help**.

Panel Four:
-----------

Untime: Vehk the God is also in some discomfort. He has conjured the sigil CHIM so he can talk to his mortal self. We can see it burning in thin air, or whatever passes for thin air in Untime. He's also conjured a scrying window so he can see his mortal self.

**Vehk the God:** I sense something **amiss**. What **occurs**?

**Vehk the Mortal:** He says ... he's the ... **new king** ...

**Vehk the God:** This challenge must be **answered!** Say my name! **Quickly!**

**CAP:** When **Vehk Indoril** says his name at the same time as his **divine self**...

**Panel Five:**

Mortal Vehk, obviously in pain and trying to focus past it. Maybe he's dragged himself away from the rail. No one is looking at him, everyone is watching the scene on High Fane.

**Vehk The Mortal (small):** ... 

**Vehk the God (continued): Hurry!**

**Vehk The Mortal (small, continued):**  vehk

**Vehk the God (continued): Vehk!**

**Cap:** ... his two **souls** merge...

**Page Four:**
==========

Panel One:
----------

Dr.Chim explodes into existence where Vehk had been a moment earlier. Some of the people who been looking over the railing have turned round, started by the noise.

**CAP:** ... and he becomes ...

**SFX (bracketing Dr.C):** **V-Vehk!**

**CAP (Large): Doctor Chim!**

Panel Two:
----------

Dr.Chim swoops down towards the figure on the High Fane steps. The figure is The Many Headed One (TMHO for short), although we still haven't got a good look at him.

**Dr.Chim:** This place is not yours to **rule**, **interloper**!

**TMHO:** **Ha!** I **knew** this would flush you out!

Panel Three:
------------

Big Panel. Now we get a good look at **The Many Headed One**, standing in front of the big arch/tunnel of High Fane. He's a big chap, standing head and shoulders taller than Dr. Chim. And he has three heads. One of them has a horned helmet and a neatly trimmed beard, one of them wears granny-glasses, a leather pharmacist's cap and a long white beard and the third one has a villainous looking cast to his face with an eyepatch and a nasty looking scar. The effect we're going for is fighter, magic-user and thief.

TMHO's outfit is similarly a mix, with maybe an iron breastplate, wizard's slippers with curly toes and fingerless gloves for better lock-picking; just mix it up a lot.

Incidentally, TMHO's head order doesn't need to be consistent. Feel free to change it from one panel to the next.

**TMHO:** A big part of your power is "**royalty**", isn't it?

**TMHO:** You had **no choice** but to meet my **challenge!**

Panel Four (inset):
-------------------

Dr. Chim's face, shouting.

**Dr.Chim (burst):** **Muatra**, to me!

**Dr. Chim:** Your challenge shall be **met**...

**Page Five:**
==========

Panel One:
----------

Looking past Dr. Chim as he floats in mid-air and blast TMHO with Muatra. TMHO is on the ground and in general doesn't fly.

**Dr.Chim (Burst, Large):** ... and **overcome!**

**TMHO:** **Ugh!**

**SFX: SHHHRAAAKKK!!**

Panel Two:
----------

The force of the blast drives TMHO back and into the High Fane arch, damaging the stonework.

**SFX: K-KRACK!**

**TMHO: Ooof!**

Panel Three:
------------

Looking over THMO's shoulder. Dr. Chim is swooping in on an attack vector, with Muatra ready to deliver a roundhouse smash.

**TMHO:** That's a good trick with the **spear**, but I've got tricks of my **own**.

**TMHO:** See, I come from **up North**...

Panel Four:
-----------

Looking side on at Dr.Chim and TMHO. Dr.Chim is almost close enough to deliver his blow, but THMO breathes frost at him, immobilising Dr.Chim in a block of ice. His head is sticking out the top.

**TMHO (burst):** ... and my breath is **LONG WINTER**!

**SFX: kk-kkk-rkk**

**SFK: THU-UUUUM!!**

**Page Six:**
=========

Panel One:
----------

Dr.Chim in the ice block. He has started to glow and his head is wreathed in fire. The ice is beginning to melt.

**Dr. Chim:** **Fool!** Mere **ice** can never hold me!

**Dr. Chim:** I am **armored** in **brilliant flame!**

**SFX:** sssssssssss

Panel Two:
----------

TMHO has turned his back and walked away from Dr.Chim a little way. He's rummaging in a back of some sort. Maybe he was wearing an adventurer backpack and this is it.

Behind him, Dr.Chim continues to melt his way out of the ice. It looks like it could break at any moment.

**TMHO:** It'll hold you for **long enough**.

Panel Three:
------------

Dr. Chim breaks loose and flies up high, readying another Muatra-blast.

**SFX: Kra-ksshhhh!**

**Cap:** You see, I've done my **research**...

Panel Four:
-----------

Large panel. Head and shoulders shot of TMHO. He's holding an unfurled scroll and the wizard head is reading from it. The other two are talking to Dr. Chim.

**TMHO/Fighter:** ... and the other half of your power comes from **starlight**.

**TMHO/Thief:** Which is why I brought this **Scroll Of Impenetrable Night**

**TMHO/Wizard (Daedric): LET DARKNESS FALL**

**Page Seven:**
===========

Panel One (Full Page):
----------------------

Dr. Chim looking very small and suddenly very lost in the center of a pure black panel.

**CAP:** "All that magicka, constantly raining down from the **sun** and the **stars**".

**CAP:** "You **swim** in it, breathing it in. **Feeding** your **power**".

**CAP:** "So what happens, I wonder, if that connection is suddenly **severed?**"

**Page Eight:**
===========

Panel One:
----------

Still outside High Fane, but now it's Night. Not utter blackness like the previous page, but the sky should be dark.

Dr. Chim falls out of the sky to land in an ungainly heap at TMHO's feet.

**TMHO:** That's what I thought.

**SFX:** ffffffffWHUMP!

Panel Two:
----------

In the foreground, TMHO snaps his fingers, causing three Dremora to port in behind him.

**TMHO:** Might as well finish this.

**SFX: SNAP!**

**SFX (Dremora) wwWommpff**

**SFX (Dremora) wwWommpff**

**SFX (Dremora) wwWommpff**

Panel Three:
------------

Looking past TMHO as the dremora sieze the barely struggling Dr. Chim and begin to drag him over the bridge and away from High Fane.

**TMHO:** All right boys: take this washed up **ex-king** and escort him off **my** lands.

**TMHO:** Don't feel you have to be unduly **gentle** with him.

Panel Four:
-----------

Dr. Chim struggling in the grip of the Dremora. He's starting to recover a little, although they still have him well in hand.

**Dr. Chim: Many Headed One!**

**Dr. Chim (cont):** You are **mistaken**!

Panel Five (thick border):
--------------------------

Vehk The God in Untime. He floats cross-legged in front of a single blue-white star, eyes closed, meditating.

This is a symbolic page, a flashback if you like. It doesn't form part of the sequence of action. Mainly it's here because it's more interesting than another shot of Dr.Chim struggling.

**CAP:** The **starlight** that empowers me is the **brilliant white star** of my **Divine Will**.

**CAP:** It burns **within** me ...

Panel Six:
----------

Dr. Chim, now fully recovered, has broken loose and swings Muatra around him in a roundhouse sweep, sending the Dremora flying in all directions.

**Dr. Chim (burst):** ... and it can **NEVER** be extinguished!

Panel Seven (inset):
--------------------

Tight on TMHO's fighter head. His expression is rueful.

**TMHO:** I **knew** that. I was just hoping you **didn't**.

**TMHO:** Oh well...

**Page Nine:**
==========

Panel One (Full Page):
----------------------

Dr. Chim and TMHO clash, trading blows. maybe both of them swinging a blow with one hand while blocking the counter blow with the other.

**TMHO (Burst)**: ... we'll just have to do this the **HARD WAY!!**

**Page Ten:**
=========

Going to be a multipanel fight scene. Feel free to show bits of the scenery getting damaged where you can fit it in.

Panel One:
----------

**CAP:** First Hour.

Dr.Chim slugs TMHO across one of his chins. TMHO doesn't seem particularly fazed.

**SFX: Whap!**

**SFK: Uhhn!**

Panel Two:
----------

TMHO backhands Dr.Chim in return, sending Dr.C flying back a little way.

**SFX: Whakk!**

**SFX: Ugh!**

Panel Three:
------------

**CAP:** Second Hour.

Dr. Chim swings Muatra, catching TMHO's three heads, one after the other.

**SFX: Thok-Thok-Thok!**

**AFX: Arrrgh!**

Panel Four:
-----------

TMHO breathes fire over Dr.Chim.

**SFX:** **YOL!**

**SFX: THU-UUUM!!**

Panel Five:
-----------

**CAP:** Third Hour.

Dr.Chim blasts TMHO with Muatra, driving him back into one of the statues which breaks.

**SFX: KSSSHHHHHHHHHH!!**

**SFX: Krack!**

Panel Six:
----------

TMHO throws a lump of statue at Dr.Chim, catching him on the head

**SFX: BAM!**

**SFK: Yarrgh!**

Panel Seven:
------------

**CAP:** Fourth Hour.

Dr.Chim power dives TMHO, executing a classic move-through maneuver and bowling TMHO off his feet.

**SFX: OOOFF!**

Panel Eight:
------------

Tight on TMHO's thief head. He looks even more beat up than usual.

**CAP:** Eventually...

**TMHO:** Say ... you want to **talk** about this?

Panel Nine:
-----------

Tight on Dr.Chim who is also showing signs of wear and tear.

**Dr. Chim:** Are you giving up?

**TMHO (cont): No!** Only ...

**Page Eleven:**
============

Panel One (Full Page):
----------------------

Pull back to see the whole of High Fane. The place is a war zone with statues toppled, holes on walls, walkways broken - it's a mess! All of it incidental damage from the superhuman battle that has been waged there.

Panel Two (inset):
------------------
Tight on TMHO's Mage head

**TMHO:** ... if we **keep this up**, there will be **no city left** to rule!

Panel Three (inset):
------------

Tight on Dr.Chim.

**Dr. Chim:** Huh.

**Dr. Chim:** Why have you come here, **Many Headed One?**

Panel Four (inset):
-------------------

Tight on TMHO/Fighter.

**TMHO:** I didn't plan on fighting you. But you know how it is...

**Page Twelve:**
============

Panel One:
----------

Hostilities are suspended. TMHO sits down on the broken steps of High Fane and starts rummaging in his pack again. Dr. Chim floats nearby watching warily.

**TMHO:** ... I had to **know**. "The ruling king who sees his **equivalent**..."

Panel Two:
----------

TMHO has unearthed a sandwitch and has started to eat it. Dr. Chim lifts his legs up into cross-legged levitation pose.

**Dr. Chim:** "... rules **nothing**." **I know**.

**Dr. Chim:** So why **did** you come here?

Panel Three:
------------

TMHO is munching on his lunch with his fighter head while the thief talks to Dr. Chim. Dr. Chim looks surprised at what TMHO says.

**TMHO:** I'd heard **rumours** about a **giant dwemer robot** being discovered.

**TMHO:** I thought I might see if I could get it **working** again.

Panel Four:
-----------

**Dr. Chim:** If you **did**  ...

**Dr. Chim:** ... what would you **do** with it?

Panel Five:
-----------

TMHO's mage head is eating now and the fighter head is talking. Dr. Chim still surprised.

**TMHO:** I was thinking...

**TMHO:** ... maybe invade **Summerset**, sack **Alinor**, subjugate the **Altmer** and force them to accept the **Sovereignty of Man**.


Panel Six:
--------------

TMHO in the same pose, thief head eating, mage talking.

**TMHO:** Would that be a **problem** for you?

Panel Seven:
------------

Same scene, no dialogue. Maybe mix up which of TMHO's heads is doing what.

Panel Eight.
------------

Same again. Going for a long beat here as Dr. Chim considers.

Panel Nine:
-----------

Same scene again. Dr. Chim has recovered from his surprise.

**Dr. Chim:** Why didn't you just say so in the **first place?**

**Page Thirteen:**
==============

Panel One:
----------

Change of scene to the road outside Vivec City. All the archeological crates from the first page have been loaded up onto guar carts and are being hauled off in the general direction of Seyda Neen. Dr.Chim and TMHO are chatting amicably, if still a little warily.

**CAP:** Later...

**TMHO:** ... **nice city**, although the **province** could **use a little work**, you don't mind me saying so.

**Dr. Chim:** What do you mean?

Panel Two:
----------

Shot of the desolate ashlands with TMHO's fighter head inset.

**TMHO:** All that **ash** and **desert**, you could make the whole place **green** if you wanted.

**CAP (Black):** **No. He could not.**

Panel Three:
------------

Back to the guar train. The carts have moved on somewhat.

**Dr. Chim:** Well maybe some of us **care** about **bio-diversity!**

**Dr. Chim:** Do you know how many **jungle species** you placed on the **endangered list** in **Cyrodill?**

Panel Four:
-----------

TMHO is laughing, maybe slapping his thigh. Dr. Chim is getting annoyed with him.

**TMHO:** **Hah!** Trust an **Elf** to be a **tree-hugger!**

**Dr. Chim:** If you **don't like it** here, **go home** to Cyrodiil. You can **start now**.

Panel Five
----------

The last cart is receding in the distance. TMHO is walking off after it.

**TMHO:** **All right! All right!** I'm **going!**

**TMHO (small):** What a **grouch!**

Panel Six:
----------

Dr. Chim framed against the Ascadian landscape.

**Dr. Chim (thinks):** And not a moment too soon. This has all taken far **too long**, and **Vehk Indoril**...

Page Fourteen:
==============

Panel One:
----------

New scene, inside the Farmers and Laborers Hall. The door to the storage room stands open and there's a blaze of light from inside it as Dr. Chim reverts to his two selves.

**CAP:** "... will surely have been **missed**".

**SFX: Vehk-Kek!**

Panel Two:
----------

**Vehk** walking out of the storeroom. He looks tired, but pleased with himself.

**Vehk:** Well, it wasn't easy but on top of everything else, I managed to clear the storeroom.

Panel Three:
------------

**Untime**: **Vekh the God**, floating cross legged and looking across the panel border at his mortal self.

**Vehk The God:** To say nothing of **saving** the **city** from **conquest**!

**Vehk The Mortal (Continued):** Yep, it's been quite a day. 

Panel Four:
-----------

 **Vehk** is continuing to talk to his divine alter ego, unaware that **Gindas Ildram** has entered the Hall. He is angry, as usual.

**Vehk:** I think I'll **knock off early** and get some sleep...

**Gindas Ildram:** **What?** Go home **early?** **Not a chance!**

**Vehk:** **Serjo Ildram!** Where did you...

**Gindas Ildram:** Where have you **been** all day, **Indoril**?

Panel Five:
-----------

To add to Vehk's misery, **Fedura** has entered through the other door. She isn't happy with Vehk, either.

**Fedura:** That's what **I** want to know!

**Vehk: Fedura!** I ...

**Fedura:** I was so **worried!** You **collapsed** and then I couldn't **find you!**

Panel Six:
----------

Vehk stands in the foreground looking straight at the reader. He is shrugging helplessly with a bemused look on his face. Behind him, Fedura stands on one side, Ildram on the other, both shouting at his, Their speech bubbles overlay each other making much of it hard to read, and the text passess behind Vehk himself. 

**Gindas Ildram:** I **told you** to clear the **storeroom!** I didn't say take the **day off** to do it! And have you **seen** the **mess** in there? It looks like an **army** has been through here. I swear if it wasn't for the **promise** I made to your **father**...

**Fedura:** I try to think the **best** of you, Vehk! I really do! But I never thought you'd **pretend to be ill** just so you could **ditch me!**  I was only gone a minute, you must have **run and hid** as soon as I was out of sight! **How could you, Vehk! How could you!**

**CAP:** "Forge a **keen faith** in the crucible of **suffering** and engrave upon thine **eyes** the image of **injustice**." 

**The End**
