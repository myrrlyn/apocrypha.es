Dear *(illisible)*,

The horrors of the war have been catching up to me recently. I've been forced to hide in a cave to escape the Thalmor. I truly hope you're doing fine wherever you are. The war has only been getting worse for us.

But that is not why I'm writing to you, friend. I'm writing to you about the savior of the Imperial City, the forgotten Shezzarine, the one that none remembers, widely known as the Forgotten Hero, or *(illisible)* as he called himself. He saved mankind by winning the battle of the Red Ring for us, for if he didn't exist we would be bowing to Elves right now. Praise be to Lord Lorkhan, for he was watching for us all this time. The missing god is the true god of all mankind. He has saved us many times throughout history, yet we refuse to acknowledge him. We are truly unworthy of this! *(the rest couldn't be recovered unfortunately)*


 â€Œ 

Yours truly
