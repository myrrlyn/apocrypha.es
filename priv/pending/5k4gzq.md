The years since coming to Mournhold have been exhausting, and I feel my joints creak with advancing age.  However, with the help of my beautiful Queen and my dearest friends Seht, Alandro and Voryn, I have been officially named Hortator of all the Chimeri Houses.

The Dwemer would probably prefer someone more magically inclined, a cousin-Psijic like my brother Seht.  He claims however, that this would be inappropriate.

I was chosen, however, specifically to bring House Dwemer to heel.  They are up to something, something dangerous, I donâ€™t know what but I can feel it in my bones.
