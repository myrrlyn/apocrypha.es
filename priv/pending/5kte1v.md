*The Starfall corsairs*

*Wayrest, 3E???*

*by a Breton priest of Dibella*

***

**T**hey caused inimaginable fear among our people. They had a reputation so bad that people used to call them a "reincarnation of Molag Bal". They were vampiric rapists, pillagers and raiders. All they cared about is loot and plunder, no more, no less. 

**T**hey go by the name of "Starfall corsairs", a name very common to one hailing from around the Bay. In fact I'd wager you didn't know that this universally not-so-common name was indeed derived from this filth, specifically from their founder, Soscron Starfall, a half-Breton half-Redguard putting our glorious race to shame.

**F**ounded sometime during the Second Era in Sentinel, at first everyone though of them as another wave of filth, but something distinguished them from the rest. Unlike the other buccaneers, they were involved in something bigger. 

**T**he entirety of the Daggerfall covenant, merely in terms of territory though was shocked to learn the truth. They were involved into the mass disappearance of populations around the Iliac bay, especially in High Rock. They enslaved the population and brought them to the Alik'r to sell them and perform some dark yet cruel practices on them. 

**I**n fact, right after they were defeated the ol' inspectors found some questionable items in one of their bases, related to the Daedra. Other than that they found no crucial information, other than a location and a date pointing out to the Alik'r which turned out to be just a normal transaction.

**O**h wait, did I say defeated? Yes, that's right. At one point during their history they captured the daughter of a noble from Wayrest, who was very close to the High King. This signaled their end as a pact was signed between High Rock and Hammerfell. It took around 3 years of long fought battles and skirmishes, and it finally ended during the battle of the Twelve Salls, deep into the Bay where they got absolutely wrecked. However much to our bad luck, the Officials already deserted their way out of the covenant, there was no way to find the real truth.

**F**inally, said everyone, the Bay is finally calm and peaceful again! Wrong, because they came back! The filth came back!

**O**nly recently, during the Third Era they came back. After almost 400 years of peace, though numbers are never too exact. However they came back! And that's what's it. There's nobody to stop them either now. Attempts have been made, but the blame is the Empire's! Damn lazy dogs! People really dislike the Empire, but we're forced to live with it. Protests, rebellions and peasants breaking out all occurred recently, all thanks to the Empire and the sudden return of the Corsairs. 

**T**hey're as notorious as ever, but luckily we've established some kind of *deal* with them. The kind hearted priests of High Rock would travel all the way to Hammerfell to pay these bastards a sum to release the slaves. I've been there so much that I hate it, but it's a necessity. Rumour has it that these damned bastards sailed all the way to Solstheim and brought Skaal slaves with them. Can you believe it?

**N**ow we've been inspecting this whole Daedra business closely lately, and we've drawn out the conclusion that these bastards are associated with the House of Troubles, if you're familiar with Dunmerri culture, which I expect of you of course.

**N**ow I know, I know! As if that wasn't obvious already! We believe they're servants of Molag Bal, judging by their vampiric nature. But they're not all vampires, obviously. 

**B**ut this so powerful organization isn't free of flaws either. It's rotten corrupted and even more divided than the Empire has ever been. They own bases all along the Northern coast of Hammerfell, and rule their so proclaimed kingdoms and *republics*.

**J**akbrdand for instance, a famous Breton buccaneer that deserted to join them founded the Sala'Kar republic, east of Sentinel, and others such as Dulpl Kasgob rule on the supposedly rumoured to be given by the Redguard royalty lands.

**Y**es, these bloody Redguards sympathize with them, because it helps their economy. They pretend to care and do indeed condemn the issue, but only in name unfortunately. 

**A** recent scandal around this was flowing all around Wayrest, that the Prince of Sentinel made a pact with Dulpl. But the Imperial dogs quickly came to rescue and covered it up, because it helps them too.

**O**ne can only hope this gets better eventually. Divines preserve us.
