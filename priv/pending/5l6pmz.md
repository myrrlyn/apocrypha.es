*From a Treatise on Smithing by Grothrang gro-Narzlbru, High Priest of Malacath, 4th Era*

Many know the old School of the Tilted Square(also known as Old Malacath Cult Style), intended to impart the quality of instability to those struck with weapons bearing said square. While this is an excellent direction of thinking, it is woefully incomplete; the square, in and of itself, is a stable shape, given the quality of instability only by its position of being tilted. Fortunately, renowned smith Uzrug gro-Shugluth, also known as the Uzrug the Mangle-Master, improved on and eventually surpassed the ideology of the Tilted Square School to create the modern School of Erratics (or Nova Malacath Cult Style) at the beginning of the 4th Era.

The School of Erratics expands upon the quality of imparting instability to foes. Rather than using the Tilted Square, the School of Erratics focuses in undulating blades and jagged edges, often combining the two. Said qualities serve to impart great instability to one's foes.

Erratic weapons often appear primitive, but every serration, jagged edge, and radical curve is intentional and contributes to the weapon's effectiveness. Often likened to ancient flint and obsidian weapons, Erratic weapons differ in that the flexibility of orichalcum enables usage of qualities and techniques that are impossible for simple stone weapons. While developing the ideology for the Erratic School, Uzrug gro-Shugluth is said to have taken inspiration from patterns found in nature.

Erratic blades have undulating edges, almost serpentine. At the height of each curve, the blade is partially shaped into a semi-regular angle. This creates the illusion of haphazardness but is actually the product of careful engineering. While parrying with an Erratic blade, unpleasant vibrations can be transmitted into an enemy weapon and its wielder by running the blade along the enemy weapon. Additionally, the semi-serration of an Erratic blade can leave lacerations on those struck with it, enabling one to inflict heavy bleeding.

Erratic blades lack a traditional cross guard and instead have a spike where the blade meets the hilt, often resembling a claw or spur on an animal. This is useful in parrying because the curve of the spur in relation to the blade can be used to break blades caught between the spur and the blade. Other Erratic weapons feature similar claw or spur designs used for similar purposes.

The Erratic School, through the use of interactions between irregular and regular shapes, utilizes instability to a far greater degree than the Tilted Square School and is a vital part of the Orcish Smithing Tradition in the modern Era. However, it must be noted that the creation of Erratic School weapons is far more time consuming and complex than that of the Tilted Square School, which is far more economical and is often the first form of weapon smithing an orc learns.
