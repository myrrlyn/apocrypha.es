Our Vehk has finally returned.

While I still feel the anger and unrest under the surface, the time spent in the Temple of the Black Hands has obviously been for the better.  There is a discipline, a calm now that was not there before.

I have been invited to a recitation of some of Vehkâ€™s poetry, and told that it pairs best with greef.

Why am I nervous?
