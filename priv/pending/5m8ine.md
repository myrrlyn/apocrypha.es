*In 3E292, a massive frozen ship was discovered, abandoned, off the northern coast of High Rock. The wreck, apparently of Atmoran origin, was completely devoid of life. In its hold were countless priceless artifacts, one of which was a metal scroll case, capped with stalhrim on both ends, containing a manuscript that appears to be a representation of the Atmoran interpretation of the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon. Central to the manuscript is an illustration of Dagon, with three of his arms flared out, holding grisly artifacts, and one of his arms held close to his torso holding his notorious Razor. He is standing atop a pile of blackened skulls, with a nimbus of fire surrounding him. His garb is horrific, a skirt of flayed faces, and a necklace of soot black tablets, and black iron torcs and bracelets on all of his limbs. He is crowned with a headdress of skulls, his horns protruding from the top twisted and jagged. Beneath the illustration was a water damaged inscription in what appears to be a variation of dragon language. What follows is a translation of the text. - Guilliame Galeurre, Scholar of Northpoint, 3E370*

Beware Dagga, Annihilation Axiom, The [Inverse Salmon?], Destroyer Once-Called-Preserver, Father of Mad [Water Fear?]. He is enemy-creation of [Destroy-Devour-Master], who returns to Reverse Entropy at each Kalpa. Fear and despise him, for he brings [evil howling?] upon the valleys. He is cunning and persistent, tormented by a geas to bring [heat exhaustion?]. To avert a most disastrous coming, eradicate the line of the King of [shifting abominations?] to the south and crack open the skulls of their children in offering to [Destroy-Devour-Master]. He is patron of violent betrayers, oathbreakers who were once fishermen, and [text too damaged]. He is the Factor of Chaos upon Kalpic progression, where he goes, he brings [evil memetics?] and violent alteration of [unknown] as to maximize entropy in his desperate lust for [heat exhaustion] and the embrace of [empty eternities?]. Know him. Hate him.


His baleful Astra:

* In his first arm he wields the Hell-Axe, which is edged in [never brittle densities?], which he uses to cut down mountain ranges to expose [earth blood] in which he cooks men for his larder.

* In his second arm, he wields the Talon-Moon of Flaying Enemies in the Most Painful Way possible for Both Victim and Wielder, with which he escapes his confinement by stitching [not-presence] in the walls of his prison.

* In his third arm he wields [High King Heads], which, by evil arts, he revives to expel [Killing Truth] upon his foes.

* In his fourth and final arm he wields his dread Razor, whose blade was forged in a dead possibility. It weaves threads of chance, setting the likelihood of [instantaneous reaction completion?] abnormally high for all who feel its bite.



Proofs against him:

* Invocations to [Destroy Devour Master]

* Invocations to [Sister Hawk]

* Clever trickery

* Wa[text too damaged] by which he can be fooled into destroying his own followers and himself for a time

* Tricking him into saying totem names, for he was [text too damaged], and will choke

[the rest of the text is too damaged]
