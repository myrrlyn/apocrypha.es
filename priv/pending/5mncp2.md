Aelana Galjum, Priestess of Boethiah, Circa 3E 225

Boethiah, the Prince of Plots, is a fickle master indeed. He is swift to punish, and quick to replace his faithful if they fail to meet his standards. He is also generous to those who do his bidding.

Our master has many artifacts, all of which gleam with the splendor of the Deceiver of Nations himself. The Ebony Mail, which almost burns one's eyes at the very sight of it. Goldbrand, the Fiery extension of Boethiah's bloodlust. But more powerful than all is Fearstruck, an Artifact so mysterious, only one legend tells the uninitiated of its existence. 

Legends tell of a mighty hero, Lysirius, who used its powers to assault Akiviri Slavetraders. It was said to be destroyed when a Wyrm blew its fiery breath at the brave hero. The shield was blasted from existence, but Lysirius was unscathed. No other common legends of this artifact survive.

However, we, as Boethiah's faithful, know why this shield has not been seen in modern times. It is the greatest of our master's boons, and is not given lightly. Therefore, we will dwell in eternal combat as we wait for one of us to ascend and be deemed worthy of its immense power by our Lord.

Long is the Arm, Swift is the Blade. All glory to the Prince of Plots
