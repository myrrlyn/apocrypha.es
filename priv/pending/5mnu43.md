Part of a letter written by an ancient, forgotten Tongue.

... The dragons have tightened their rule. They must sense that we are plotting against them. The Priests' oppression has gone on long enough. First, we will assault [undecipherable] on the outskirts of Windhelm. Our Dragon Allies will keep the enemy dragons busy while we shout open the gates and take every head...

... defenses have been worn down, we will assault Bromjunaar, the capital. We will cut off the head of the cult, and then take the fight to the dragon overlords. We must kill Alduin. Without their... Tyranny will end. Prepare your men for the assault.

Kyne be with you,
[Undecipherable]
