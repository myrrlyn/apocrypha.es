*Kingdom of Wayrest, 2E 367*

Another payment had to be made. Guardsmen usually did it by themselves, but now, when a prince was assigned to join the guard, it should be him to do it. Even though the beast terrified him to death.    
Trystan took a deep breath and clutched the chest in his arms even tighter. He made sure his sword is at his hip - although he doubted it would help him in any way - and addressed his soldiers. “All right. Show me the way.”    
The guard captain took a step towards the prince. “Are you sure you want to meet him alone, your grace? You know, he… he is an ally of your father, but also so unpredictable… I have lost over a dozen men who became too cocky in his presence. Just greet him, show him the gems, and get back.”    
Trystan put on his most confident face. “Yes, I am going. Why else would I be assigned to this unit if I am never to meet the one we are protecting?”    
The captain nodded. “Yes, your grace.” He pointed him towards one of the tunnels in the stone wall and handed him a torch. “This one leads to the main chamber. Good luck.”    
“Thank you, captain.” Trystan put the gilded box of gems under his armpit to free his other hand to the torch. The tunnel was rather narrow, but not too long. Soon, it opened into a dark, ominous cavern. Trystan carefully stepped in.    
He treaded carefully, torch raised high, illuminating the floor. Small stones and irregularities on the floor casted long, shaky shadows, and an occasional glint of a gem or metal shone back at the prince. The walls of the cavern were so far away that they were barely visible. Darkness was everywhere.    
“Hello?” he yelled into the void, trying to keep a firm voice. “My name is Trystan de Gardner, third son of the king, your ally. I brought you what is due.”    
A soft and warm breeze blew in Trystan’s face, almost like an invitation. He continued deeper into the cave. “Are you here, my lord?”
A sound of many coins sifting against each other was the response, followed by another gust of breeze. Then… a voice, resonating through the poor prince’s bones, flesh and soul.    
**”Yes,”** he rumbled, **”I am. Let us look at you, first.”**    
A string of unknown words carrying power resonated through the entire cavern, as braziers along the walls and chandeliers hanging from the ceiling suddenly caught fire to illuminate the room. Trystan dropped his torch in shock, as he finally lay eyes on the dragon.    
Laying on a rather large pile of gold coins and gemstones was him, a large, red-scaled, winged, horned monster, smugly observing the prince’s reaction.    
**“This is only the second Gardner I see. You don’t look much like Casimir, no. Joor kirzir. So complicated.”** He leaned his long jagged neck closer towards Trystan. **”Third son? So you will not be my new ally when your father goes to Sovngarde...or wherever you Munfahliils go. Why are you here and not your brother?”**    
“Uh… I requested my service here, my lord. I have always wanted to meet you. You are responsible of great wealth and prosperity for our kingdom. I wanted to personally thank you.” Trystan rehearsed this line for so long that it didn’t sound as terrified as he expected.    
**”Hahaha… another bottom-kissing mortal. I know you Munfahliils. What intrigue is behind your pleasantries? Do you want to be the king after all? Try to befriend me and then convince me to eat your brothers alive?”**    
This went south too fast. “Uhm… no, my lord. Not at all. I…”    
**“Give me a reason not to eat you instead. Right here, right now.”**
His mind raced. “That would… it would surely damage your relationship with my f... father, your king and he might not focus on mis… misleading the Dragonguard in the future…”    
**“Waaait a minute, you puny joor. Are you threatening me? Oh, and Casimir is no king of mine. I do not have any king since Alduin-mah, and I’d never bend the knee to a mortal. Such a thing is very insulting to say to a proud dovah!”** The dragon gritted his fangs. **“Zu’u Nahfahlaar, Strun do Lok Vild, duaan do sille, stin!”**    
Trystan backpedalled, but keeping his eyes on Nahfahlaar as he crawled through masses of gold towards the prince. He looked around the room and focused all his magicka for a spell to save his life. He raised his hands, thanking his mentor for lessons in frost spells.    
All braziers and chandeliers were extinguished at once, plunging the cavern into darkness. Trystan ran to the direction where he expected to find the tunnel leading back outside, but he just ran into a wall, fruitlessly grasping the stone to find any sort of doorway.    
**”TAHRODIIS JOOR!”** echoed behind him. **”SHUL!”**    
A ball of fire formed in the center of the cave, illuminating most of it, Trystan with it. And… the door. Few meters from him. He immediately jumped in. Nahfahlaar can’t fit inside to pursue him.    
**”Mortal! You! I… well, actually, I am impressed. Casimir is a dumb warmonger, but you are cunning!”**    
Trystan was already behind a corner in the tunnel. The dragon’s fangs or breath could not harm him anymore. Still, he stood there and listened, as the beast crawled closed to the door. **”Mortal… you forgot to give me my payment. The storm I summoned was ordered and it should be fairly paid for. Then we could maybe talk some more… I do see your potential. And the riches and souls you would bring me as the next king. I doubt your brothers could pull this stunt off. You are indeed very smart.”**    
Trystan opened the box and threw it into the corridor. Soul gems of various shapes and sizes spilled on the floor, for Nahfahlaar to see.
**”Oh, a black one!”** exclaimed the dragon in excitement. **”Who’s soul is inside?”**    
Trystan’s voice was calm and surprisingly confident. “A Redguard admiral from Sentinel. The leader of the fleet your last storm obliterated. We captured him and I got the idea you would like his soul.”    
Nahfahlaar loudly moaned. **”Geh! Hes rel! The souls of opponents I vanquished myself are the sweetest of all.”** The dragon then whispered something powerful again, and a sudden gust of breeze blew all the soul gems from the corridor back to the cave. **“Hin sille los dii… geh… So exquisite...”**    
Did the dragon eat the gems? Trystan pondered this and many other things, as he returned to the outside of the mountain. This did not go as expected. Should he trust that Nahfahlaar changed his mind about him so quickly, or is he playing him?    
Despite that unanswered question, he felt much, much closer to kingship.
