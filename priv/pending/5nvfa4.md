Vehk has left with Seht, for the Clockwork Citadel.

While part of me does not want them alone together, this is for the best.

Ayem has been withdrawn.  We are trying to repair our communication, and I am sorry to say it but Vehk has driven a wedge between us that we cannot understand.

We focus on politics, where were can forget about our tattered House.

The shaggy men stir, and the Dwemer are definitely hiding something.

I should seek out Voryn, it has been several months since we have spoken.  He always knows what to say when I am in a mood.
