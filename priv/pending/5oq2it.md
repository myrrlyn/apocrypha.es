I wonder what Seht and Vehk are doing now.

The design of the Clockwork Citadel is unique in all my travels.  Dwemer complexes are scribs next to the fully grown Kwama Queen that is the homestead of my Seht.  During one of my first visits, I was not used to the way the lines were placed, and I found myself almost falling into a pit of silently moving gears.

Seht caught me by my belt, and easily lifted me back to safety.  I remember the vertigo, and leaning heavily against Sehtâ€™s broad chest as my stomach emptied itself.

We had traveled there by magic, which he said he had learned on Artaeum.  I asked if his Citadel was like the mysterious island of the Psijic Order.

He laughed, and said if I ever again compared his creation to that pathetic captive whale he would throw me into the gears himself.

He then jerked my body back towards the pit and back, laughing, as I clung dizzily to him.

Seht has always had an odd sense of humour.
