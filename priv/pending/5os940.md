Encoded in Guild cipher and hand delivered by the most reliable urchins in Wayrest to select members of the Wayrest Thieves Guild, 4E222

-----
*To the Thief, Vagabond, Crook, Confidence Trickster, Burglar, Robber, Highwayman, or individual of similar persuasion affiliated with the Wayrest Thieves Guild who now possesses this invitation.*
----

*You are cordially invited to The Annual Feast of Our Concealed Lady Masquerade Ball, this 3rd of Hearth Fire in the Wayrest Guildhall at dusk!*

*Celebrate the day of the Night Mistress' Summoning with a masked ball, with entertainment provided by our very own Twelve Fingered Fabian and his Dextrous Orchestra! Catering provided by renowned chef and retired bandit Youssef the Trout, using only the finest ingredients donated by various peers of High Rock!*

*All attire except masks must be "borrowed", preferably from the most esteemed echelons of society, with prizes awarded to those whose ensembles are appraised to have the highest net value in today's market, should the wearers choose to participate in the contest. Masks must be of a value of at least 300 septims.*

*There will be a silent auction on goods acquired from the most prestigious establishments throughout High Rock, with the famed Rat-Catcher's Ear Stud (said to confer great agility to its wearer) being the centerpiece.*

*Entrance fee of at least 100 septims. Identity, masks, and attire must be triple checked by Guild personnel before entrance is granted.*

*-G.*

Author's note: The Guild uses this as a way for high ranking members to make connections, exchange information on various targets and hazards, and recruit each other for heists, as well as testing each others skills at deduction, pickpocketing, and lying (through coming up with bogus stories about how they acquired their attire). Lately, the Guild has been inviting affiliated arms dealers, pirates, and smugglers.
