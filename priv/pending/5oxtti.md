Sermons of Malacath I

The IV Corners of the Orsimer.

Strength in the eyes of the unworthy means naught,

For in the eyes of our Father, it means infinitely more,

as the stares and jeers of the unworthy are brought

upon us - the window may be closed, but open is the door

to Ashpit, where we will watch their deserved demise

with a mug in our hand and a lover in our arms!

Will in the eyes of the unworthy means naught,

For in the eyes of our Father, it means infinitely more,

as the crumbling minds of the unworthy are like pillars

built upon the sand - prone to falling to the forces of oars

that fell the pillars of their fragile minds!

Endurance in the eyes of the unworthy means naught,

For in the eyes of our Father, it means infinitely more,

as the frail bones of the unworthy break like brittle brick

while we stand strong with burdens that we have bore

from our creation until forever, we bear that heavy weight!

The Orsimer in the eyes of the unworthy means naught,

For in the eyes of our Father, we mean infinitely more,

as he gives us the four corners of the Orsimer -

Strength, Will, Endurance, and Comradeship;

That will stand long after the unworthy

are long gone in History!

The Values of Life

Live with Honour, but not without Respect.

Live with Caution, but not without Love.

Live with Stubbornness, but not without the Acceptance of due aid

For Malacath teaches us to rise above the hate, not sink below.

Live with Integrity, but not without Compassion.

Live with Rivalry, but not without Kinship.

Live with Discipline, but not without Desire

For Malacath teaches us to rise above the repulsion, and show our beauty.

Live with Determination, but not without Forethought.

Live with Piety, but not without Free Thought.

Live with Strength, but not without Endurance

For Malacath teaches us to channel his power through our arms and our minds.

Sermons of Malacath III 

A Dream of Ashpit

An Orc Dream of Ashpit fills the spirit

Like a barrel of home-brewed mead.

So, stay here kin, for the very truth - hear it!

An Orc Dream of Ashpit tempers even the dullest blade

For our Father, Malacath does live in that very haze!

He gives unto us not just his Love in this life

but in the Next as well.

An Orc Dream of Ashpit calms even the fiercest woman

For the awe and wonder silences the tongue with its beauty

But emboldens the heart and soul!

An Orc Dream of Ashpit psychs even the most passive of us.

For our Father, Malacath does live in that very haze!

He demands determination of our love.
