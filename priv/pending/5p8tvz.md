Xrib, Echo Eater. Xrib, Heat-Stealer. To you do we gnash our teeth.

You who are without echo, you who swallow the clicks of our tongues.

You speak to us in the deep hollows, in the shed blood, in the dry bone.

We offer warm meat from the Hated Above, we offer not-stone from our dead Conductors.

Oh great Xribis, patron of all tribes, grant us your blessed hatred and we will worship you in ecstasy.

Hail Xribis, Scratch the Flesh.
