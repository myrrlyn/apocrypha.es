The dragon Tuzkrentokaaz teaches his adoptive daughter Jaan about the creation of dragon priest masks by the Drake Faastilimax and the Jill Qruhnilaax.

----

The fourth Concept was OTAR, which is a word that describes the sound of madness.

Qruhnilaax and Faastilimax were flying in sequence between measures when an awful clangor came upon them. This clangor was a great rain cyclone that swallowed them into its eye.

As they gathered their bearings, they saw a two headed drake. This drake was called SHEOR, the Nonsense Verse, and he appears at random to throw confusion into arguments and play notes contrary to The Song.

SHEOR said unto them in unison: "Good pastmorrow, hast thou any fermented milk?"

The pair replied: "No, Nonsense Verse, we have no milk for thee, fermented or otherwise."

And SHEOR said unto them in unison: "But how dost thou plan to pay the crossing toll then?"

And SHEOR gibbered uncontrollably until everything had abbreviated into a great city of JOOR, ruled by a mad THURI with a crown made of severed toes.

Qruhnilaax and Faastilimax had been abbreviated into lesser mortal aspects laying siege to the city. 

Betwixt existence-states they fought, with SHEOR sitting at his feasting table drinking inordinate amounts of green tea, sending contradictions to fight Qruhnilaax and Faastilimax.

As they reached his feast hall, they found that they could not dismiss SHEOR's aspect, but the could overwrite it temporarily. They cut open SHEOR's veins, for his blood was Chaos, and forged a cage from the time-frozen primordia. Faastilimax and Qruhnilaax then cut off each of SHEOR the man-king's two heads, making SHEOR's gibberings mute.

As everything elaborated back into the storm and the Drake and the Jill, the pair noticed that SHEOR had vanished, tying their tails together as he went. But the storm had dissipated into a cloud that smelled like OTAR, from which they gleaned the fourth Concept.

Faastilimax took what had been SHEOR's tea, which had elaborated back into ecstatic-colored crystal, and chiseled it into a God-Face upon which Qruhnilaax recorded OTAR, granting it the blessing of Perseverance against Chaos.
