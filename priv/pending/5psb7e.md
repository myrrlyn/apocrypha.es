Thalmor Dossier: Tonal Manipulation

Status: Under Research, Moderate Priority, Emissary Level Approval

Description: Form of magic that utilizes sound and vibrations to alter reality

Status: We have little understanding of how tonal manipulation works at this point in time, but it has the potential to greatly accelerate our plans. Unfortunately, few working examples are available for study. It is difficult to discern myth from history in many accounts of Tonal Manipulation, and modern sources can be just as unreliable.

The most obvious potential sources of understanding are the remnants of the Dwemer civilization, who appear to have been the first to use and understand the school (if Tonal Manipulation may be considered a school at all.) There are rumors of working tonal machinery in Arkngthamz, but these describe some sort of lock or trap rather than a productive artifact. Agent Ancano is currently keeping watch on an Arniel Gane that appears to be investigating the subject, though he is preoccupied with the Sarthaal excavation at this point in time. The Numidium has been theorized to work through tonal manipulation, but it’s highly unlikely that any scraps of that machine remain. 

Of course, there’s also the lately-infamous Nord practice of “Dragon Shouting”. Unfortunately, we have not found any practitioners that are willing to share information on the technique. Former prisoner Ulfric Stormcloak refused to divulge his knowledge and the so-called “Greybeards” on High Hrothgar have reacted with hostility to inquiry. Rumors about a new Dragonborn are being investigated, but accounts of his identity are highly varied and seem to lack useful information about his location. To further complicate things, research concerning past Dragonborn indicates that even if one exists and could be found, he would be unwilling or unable to assist in our research. If the Blades loremaster Esbern is found and captured, interrogation on the subject is highly recommended. 

Other forms of tonal manipulation come with similar difficulties. The fabled Yokudan art of sword-singing appears to have lost its tonal control (if it really involved Tonal Manipulation at all) and it is highly unlikely that records on the subject would be of any use. Whether or not the Middle Dawn was the result of Tonal Manipulation, I doubt that its replication would benefit the Thalmor. It was difficult enough to clear up that mess once and the ritualistic component of the process involves a great amount of unpredictability. 

The appropriate authorities will be notified in the case of a significant new discovery. It is advised that Thalmor agents be extremely cautious when dealing with Tonal Manipulation. Do not attempt to interact with objects or beings that exhibit related powers without the advice of a qualified Thaumaturge. Further research funding may lead to great leaps and bounds in our understanding of Tonal Manipulation, and as such it is encouraged.
