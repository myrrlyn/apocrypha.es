*By the blessing of Jurgen the Calm and his Seventeen Disciples,*

*Faithful ruminants, corruption rears its head across Tamriel! Aldmeri Zealot-Armies swarm across the south like amber locusts, seeking to murder causality and bring about primordial chaos! Inqusitor-Angels gestate in the bowels of Thalmor strongholds, awaiting their dread birth! The Bosmer and Khajiit ravage the land as mutant abominations, shackled, as they always have been, to the will of the High Elves and the Aldmeri Dominion.*

*The horrors of foreign lands are kept at bay only by the efforts of High Hrothgar, Skyrim secluded in the eye of the Storm. But the SU'UM of our Tongues grows ever shorter, soon the Totem-Wall shall break. Even now, the people of Skyrim flee, escorted by the DOVAH, back to the place of our people's birth, Holy Monahaven.*

*Fear not, at the Tolling of the Bell, TALOS-AKA-SHOOR shall send His savior unto us once more. The World-Eater shall return, his scales shall be ebony, his Voice shall be cleansing flame, his wings shall blot out the sun, and his name shall be DOVAHKIIN. The plans of the Aldmer shall be thwarted and the Isles of Summerset be razed to the ground, the Inquisitor-Angels of the Thalmor shall be strangled in their gestation, their unholy ascension stillborn. The Kalpa shall turn and the world will be born anew. The works of mortals shall be undone, and all life will be reborn, save for the Faithful who achieve blessed Dracosymbiosis, who shall go on eternal as oracle-aspects to the DOVAH, and for the most devoted, Dracochrysalis shall be achieved, their mortal aspects forever shed to soar triumphant as living gods in the skies of the next Kalpa!!!! HAIL DOVAHKIIN THURI!!!!*

*-Greybeard SUVULAAN, Ascetic-Priest of The Church of The Voice,  committed to the Wind-Annals in 5E4*
