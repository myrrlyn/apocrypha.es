**Daedric Dossier: Desideratum**

**By Emsubal, Dremora Archivist of the Concilium Mercantator**

The Council of Merchants, Lord Vile’s inner circle, has given me the duty of writing this “pocket guide” to the Master’s Realm of Serenity. Before we begin, many mortals have been very keen on knowing my Master personally, as neither those who serve him, nor his domain in Oblivion are known to the denizens of Tamriel. It should be noted, that the true name of the child-god’s realm remains a mystery, even to those close to Him. Therefore, this document shall be compiled of my own knowledge of the Master’s realm, and I shall only be listing what is necessary to know. With that aside, let us begin.

Unlike Dagon’s Deadlands, or Molag Bal’s Coldharbour, Clavicus Vile has rendered his domain as an idyllic countryside, dotted with majestic merchant utopias, fields of white clovers, woodland meadows, twisted foliage, and odd melted-looking places. The air smells of both wildflowers and a profound decay, while the sky is blue with cottony clouds, and greenish-gray streaks that stain the atmosphere. The realm itself houses the many souls of mortals that have made wagers with Lord Clavicus, as well as the deceased members of the Cyrodiil Vampyrum, and the Little Key cult, a small commercial sect with a monopoly on worshipping the Prince of Pacts. Very little is known about them, but they are known to be very powerful, and influential within the Imperial City. Political turmoil between the Cyrodiil Vampyrum, and the Little Key is quite common, especially in the Kingdom of Tranquility where both factions vie for the Master’s favor. Those within the Jovial Lambasters of Rimmen are also known to find serenity in the Desideratum; mainly hosting festivals, celebrating in Lord Vile's name.

The realm itself is guarded by powerful Dremora wearing golden Daedric armor that glistens, and changes between a multitude of colors when exposed in sunlight. They are quite common throughout the realm, keeping order, and making sure that everything is in it’s proper place. In the upper echelons of the realm lies the most prominent merchant cities, with Veinardia and Merveilleux being among the most grand. Here, the primary force of serenity is kept in check by the most deadliest of Daedra, the Djinnkyn (or ‘wishing warriors’), Vile’s personal guard. Unlike the Merchant Dremora, and the Clannfear that are commonly used for transportation, the Djinnkyn are “special”. Being the result of vestige mutation between the wish-granting Daedra Djinn, Lord Vile’s most favoured servants, and the warmongering Dremora. So far, there have been no records of the Djinnkyn being seen outside of the Master’s realm, which is to be expected, as they normally remain by Clavicus Vile’s side, or serving as commanders in areas of interest to Vile. Some members of the Djinnkyn are known for serving as bodyguards to powerful Dremora merchant lords, like Palial, who oversees the grand utopia of Veinardia, which was previously mentioned.

Another important characteristic of the Desideratum is its place as the center of trade and commerce within the realms of Oblivion. As the Lord of Bargains, Vile is the most sought out Prince when an important deal needs to be made. This in turn, makes Lord Clavicus a necessity within the Daedric hierarchy.

For all who read this discourse, I hope the knowledge you have received pleases your needs, and therefore, I shall be sending it to the appropriate parties for review, and approval.
