The months since Vehk left have given Ayem and I a chance to focus on politics and each other.

Love and passion are curious things.

Ayem and I were sat in our lounge, as I worked some knots out her shoulder from her swordplay that day.

She asked me if I thought she was a monster for giving in to Vehkâ€™s advances.

Had this occurred before Vehk's study at the Temple of the Black Hands, my answer would have been different.

Vehk is not the tattered innocent I brought to Mournhold, but a strong and independent mer who will do great things.

Ayem put her arms around my neck and whispered that while her passions remain divided, the heart beats only for me.
