#Gospel of Amaranthine Truth

---
1.
Vehk: I am the nines time nine sigil, and the sixteen blasphemies are branded on my bosom.

Mephala: I am the usurper’s ambition, and the royal assassin. 

Vehk: I am become Amaranth. Strong as acacia, fragrant as frankincense.

Jubal: Is it the nighttime already? Has sleep taken me by surprise, or am I too dead for dreaming?

[Night creeps further into blackness, yet perpetually apart from the new day’s dawn. In the distance, Azura weeps softly so as to not wake the flower-child of her betrayer.]

Vehk: He who walks in shadows grows accustomed to the dark. And he who speaks in whispers grows accustomed to the secrets. Repose is the only defense against death.

Nerevarine: speak to me the sweet nothings whispered to you by the Prince of Love-by-Force.

Vehk: When you make inside as the outside, and the outside as the inside; you will come to know your own will. When you make the male as the female, and the female as the male, you will be the two in one as one, under your own will. He said unto me, Love without will is an affront to the YOU, the ruling king.

Nerevarine: How may I ascend as You have?

Vehk: When you make the two into one, you shall become a ruling king. When you come to know yourself, you will become known, and you will realize that you are all are we.

[Jubal approached the Nerevarine in the provisional house]

Jubal: You have known my wife for many years. Is there anything you know of her that I don’t?

[the Nerevarine contemplated this for many cycles of untime before approaching The Bride]

Nerevarine: What is it that the Father-of-all-Flutists doesn’t know of you?

[They spoke for seventy seven cycles of utime before the Nerevarine backed away, face glowing. He approached Jubal]

Jubal: What was it that my beloved taught you?

Nerevarine: If I were to utter the words, you would pick up the disregarded cornerstone with which to stone me, but we would 
both be consumed by flames.

Jubal: I am fading with every cycle, and with me, my dream. Know that memory had left my people, and yet I sent my letter. The House of We shall depart from the Grey Maybe as Artaeum departed from the sea. Know this and answer me.

Nerevarine: Vehk said “whoever has come to understand the world has found a corpse, and whoever has found a corpse is superior to the world. I am the corpse as Jubal is the world. But He will be dead soon, too.”

[They were engulfed in flame]

Dumalacath(watching from afar): Were not two men engulfed in the fire? But I see three men loose, and they are not hurt; and the appearance of the third is like a god.

[Following his success at Red Mountain, the Nerevarine travelled to Akavir.]

Nerevarine: I have sought, and now I have found. I have become troubled. Through astonishment, I will rule over the all. 

[the Nerevarine consulted his Triune of shape-shifting anthropomorphs: His shadow, Indoril Nerevar, and the shade of the Sharmat]

Shadow: How can the inner become the outer when it is so divided. Can we have unity without blurred lines. Without a Grey Maybe?

Shade of the Sharmat: How can the inner become the outer when it is so divided. Can we have unity without blurred lines. Without a Grey Maybe?

[The shadow and the shade of the Sharmat speak in unison, and merge together to form another shadow, slightly darker than the 
one before]

Nerevarine: Now there are naught but two of you. Two is an inelegant number in the realm of divinity.

[the Nerevarine reaches into the provisional house and brings Jubal with him into Akavir.]

Jubal: What you have done, you cannot do. To leave the endless untime is to face death for me and my world. The jills have been after me ever since I wrote my letter.

Nerevarine: You need not worry, for this is the land of your one true son, whose bloodthirst is renowned and ambition untethered. For he is the dragon god of the dragon land. Born of landfall. The Flower-baby of numantia.

Jubal: This is the land of milk and honey? Where I shall open my womb and release the nu-men?

Nerevarine: Perhaps it is just a shadow of a dream; But, It will do. I have brought you here for I must find astonishment to rule over the all, but compared to the miracles of Twice Vehk, I cannot be impressed.

Jubal: With Mephala as my witness, hear me sing the polyphonic overtones which bent the snake men before Reman.

[Jubal sings a two-toned lullaby for his son, the Raka Tosh. As he sings, the trees begin to fall asleep, the Shadow begins to yawn; the Nerevarine remains skeptic for he lived a thousand different lives and heard a thousand such songs.]

Indoril Nerevar: I have long since died, and yet here I stand. You are I, yet foul murder has not scarred your skin. Watch as we may become one.

[Nerevar faces the Nerevarine and fuses, so that they may be one in the same.]

Nerevarine: this is not the feeling of completion. This is a shallow connection, for our union creates dissonance. The sourest harmony is that which lies closest to the root. I have walked as many men, and denied myself as all of them. We have picked up the muatra and followed thy lord into the land of ruling kings. 

[The Nerevarine and Nerevar split. Nerevar looks taken aback. The Nerevarine then splits himself again, and his ever-shifting 
female-form comes to know Nerevar, before reuniting with the Nerevarine.]

Shadow: Do not despair, I know true amazement. Only true harmony can come from the marriage of things unalike. I am the shade of Ur as I am the shade of You. I am what you are not. To know astonishment we must be as one. Accept the Sharmat, for you are Him, as He is the Hortator.

[The Nerevarine embraces his shadow, that which is the remains of the Ur. The shadow melts into him and he rejoices, for he 
knows true astonishment. A union in harmony.]

Nerevarine: Blessed are you, my shadow; for in my consumption of you, you have become man.

EDIT: fixed the formatting, I always forget to double down on the returns.
