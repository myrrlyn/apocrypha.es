Alandro has been one of my most important friends and advisors.  I am forever in the debt of Seht for having introduced us.

Alandro accompanies me on most of my diplomatic missions, in his Velothi armour, trimmed with the Moon-and-Star, he is a most impressive figure.

Today was a day where I accompany him, however.  Always favoured by Azura, Alandro has been offered her highest blessing: an immortal bond to her realm, a rebirth as a child of Royalty.

In this manner, my dearest Alandro has become as the Ada, and I am most blessed to keep company with him.  That he chose me to witness his holy apotheosis in the presence of his wondrous matron is an honour I shall never forget.

The Prince even offered me a blessing of my own:

My Son loves you like no other

And so I will also cherish his love

And you

Until you are are one

Which to say all.
