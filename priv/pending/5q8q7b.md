##Speech of Surrender of the Akaviri General at the Pale Pass    

Hail, Dragonborn! Before you stands the greatest army of the eastern lands of Akavir. We of Tsaesci have always served those of the dragon-blood. For long centuries was our land graced with the Voice of the Dragon, but for many more still has it been without. Thus did we leave our ancestral lands, thinking to find conquest and glory, but praying to find you. Now your godsblood has been made clear to us, your might unquestionable as your sword drips still with our soldiers’ blood. Thus, if you will have us, I pledge unto you my sword and scales, and the sword and scales of every man and woman of Tsaesci in my army, to protect and serve you, and your godsblood kin, for all the rest of their days. The blades and fealty of Tsaesci are yours, Dragonborn.
