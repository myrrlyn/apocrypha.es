Ayem has acted strangely since Alandro was given Azura's gift.

“I did not know you felt so strongly for him,” she said to me one night in bed.

I said nothing, but I know she felt me shrug.

“Voryn dislikes Alandro, you know.  Says he has strange eyes.  Like anchors around his neck.”

I chuckled and kissed her scarlet hair.

“Alandro may be the only person who truly sees the difference between Voryn and I.”
