*A note pinned to the front of the leather-bound folio reads: [As per your request for a note on my progress, the following document, the “Mundus Remanada”, as it has been dubbed (by me), is the next in-progress translation of the cache of ancient documents recent acquired by the Imperial Geographical Society (you know the one). It appears to be a variant, in full, of the Remanada, an ancient text describing the mythic birth of Reman Cyrodiil. The text is contemporary, with no signs of forgery or blatantly false information, but thus-far is much more divergent and unprecedented than the Remanada we know. I won’t mince words, Artorius. This is an historical bombshell, and the Emperor may not like it. I would suggest you hold off informing him until the work is complete, and when you receive your official completed translation, that you pen yourself a copy before bringing it to him. Expect another update soon. ~A.]*

###Chapter 1: Birth of a King    

As light is conceived in darkness, so too was the Light of Man conceived in the dark of the earth.^1 In the bowels of ancient Sard the Gods first revealed themselves to the Slave-Queen, *and* this place she did choose for her Incarnation.^2 Thus did much of the ruined city crumble to dust as the Golden Hill rose up.^3 Foxes and bulls were seen to climb the growing hill, and even the bull-men came to worship, gathered at the east as pious farmers and shepherds gathered to the west.^4 They had come following the stars, for after many months of growing, the Warrior and the Thief together appeared above the mount, followed soon by a new group of stars, which some called the Uncoiled Serpent but others called the Dragon Crown.^5 And each pilgrim was met by the first, the shepherdess Sed-Yenna.^6    

For the spirit of the Al-Esh had appeared to Sed-Yenna, first in glimpses in the river where she prayed, then in her dreams.^7 Twice did the Slave-Queen *come*, wreathed in fire, belly swollen with her gestations and breasts withered with age.^8 From her ashen feet and clenched fists the fire came, consuming and restoring the spirit in turn, and around her neck hung low the Ruby of Kings, resting on the crown of her belly.^9 The spirit pointed the way to ancient Sard, and Sed-Yenna knew in her heart what was asked of her.^10 Thus did she and *her* sister Shonni-Et make pilgrimage, to watch the Golden Hill grow from mud-mound to mountain, and to spread the good news to each pilgrim who came.^11 Thus did many look on with joy when, after the quakes came and ceased and the first cry rung out, the shepherdess Sed-Yenna ascended Sancre Tor, returning with the Child-ut-Cyrod, bearing in his brow *the* Ruby of Kings which promised Imperial renewal.^12 At the foot of the mountain Shonni-Et placated herself before the babe, removing her silks to swaddle him.^13 Together the sisters carried him to the Eternal City, followed in procession by many of the people who lived near that place and the places the sisters passed through.^14 And their followers shouted joyously of the babe’s miraculous birth to any who would listen.^15

###Chapter Two: The Taking of the Tower    

Now in these days the Eternal City was ruled by a petty regent named Jacobus, a puppet of the ancient Council of Elders, which claimed authority from its origin in the Aleshut’s Council of Skiffs.^1 *As* the procession approached the city word reached the regent, who feared for his rule.^2 As they approached the gates he met them there, surrounded by guards.^3 He spoke unto the sisters, saying “Who are you people, and why do seek entry into my city in such numbers?”^4 It was Shonni-Et who answered, saying “We do the work of the Gods, regent, and bring this babe, called Reman, the heir to the Slave-Queen, born of the Golden Mountain, unto his throne. Look ye upon his brow, and behold the proof of his manifest destiny.”^5 And the regent did behold the babe and the Ruby of Kings, but wickedness twisted him and in his heart he rejected him.^6 “This is but a trick, and that jewel just a bauble. Begone from here! There can be no heir to Alessia’s Thronel!"^7 And as he spake these words the Ruby erupted in balefire on Reman’s brow, and the light of this flame did strike Jacobus dead.^8 *His* guards dropped to their knees at the sight of the miracle, and the sisters walked on, stepping over the regent’s corpse, entering the Tower with no more disruption and to much praise.^9 There she did place the babe Reman on his Throne, where he spake as an adult, saying I AM CYRODIIL COME.^10     

The Council of Elders, fearful of the fate of Jabocus and wise to the moods of the army and citizens, soon gathered to swear fealty to the babe, who stared each of them in the eyes as they did so, flanked by the sisters.^11 When the new regent suggested they depart and leave the babe solely in Imperial care, the infant Reman flashed a red-lit face of fury, and the sisters refused, saying “We have been sworn unto him by a power much greater than your own; if you seek to remove us, there will be blood.”^12 And the regent agreed that they might remain as Midwives to the King.^13 And in this manner did eleven years pass.^14 And in this time did the sisters instruct the King in the ways and customs of his many peoples, from the Eastern belly-magics to the Western totem-prayers, and all things in-between.^15 Thus in the season before his twelfth year Reman did declare that the time had come for the ancient jarls and petty-kings of Ald-Colovia and of the Niben to pledge themselves unto him.^16

###Chapter 3: The Uniting of Cyrodiil      

Nibenay came readily to the side of the boy-king, it’s petty-kings and queens far too new and weak to resist the Chim-El Adabal.^1 The people too loved the boy-king, for he honored their customs and the river in kind.^2     

Yet many of those olden kings of Ald-Colovia resisted him, for they gloried in their independence and cared nothing for the lands beyond their own.^3 Reman himself did lead his Imperial Legion, the first true Legion in a millennium, accompanied by his Midwife-Wives, whose swords sung in the wind.^4 First he took the fortress-city of Chor, which fell in the first day as its soldiers wavered.^5 Then he marched on the petty-hold of Fal’kreath, where he laid low their proud army, and Shonni-Et did kill their proud king, bringing his head to Reman, who ejaculated on it, declaring his provenance and glory in many voices as one, and the head begged for mercy for his people through fouled lips.^6 But they were Reman’s people, and he would love those that stood with him, and destroy those who stood against him.^7 And as had their king did many of the people choose to resist Reman, and each received the same reward, so that in this manner did ninescore of their people die, and the ground of 'Kreath was filled with corpses and godseed.^8 And news of this conquest spread far across the land, so that when Reman returned to his Tower and demanded the sword-surrender and oath of allegiance from all the kings and queens of the Cyrodiils, no others resisted him.^9
