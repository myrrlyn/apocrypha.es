*I've been reading Varn's old books while he wasn't looking. I swear, I'm this close to turning into a god. I don't know why more wizards don't do it, the way he wrote it made it seem easy. The first method I found was "Walking like them until they walk like you," and I figure that's easy. Just gotta find someone who's easy to walk like. So, I've been following Varn around, walking like he does. He limps a little on his left foot, so I've been doing that. It's kind of uncomfortable, actually, but I'll be sitting pretty in my own little slice of Aetherius when I'm done!* 

*It also says something about "Mantling," so I looked it up and that means that thing in heraldry where colorful stuff comes out of a helmet. Easy! I went out, bought a helmet and some feathers, and now all I gotta do is keep walking around like Varn. Everyone looks at me weird, probably because they're so impressed. I'll be a god by Fredas at this rate!*

*I only get to look at Varn's books when he's not looking, though, so to make sure I have enough memory I've been drinking lots and lots of water. I heard him say water is memory once, so I'll be set.*
