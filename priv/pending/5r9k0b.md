Voryn, Alandro and I went to visit with King Dumac, who was generous with his hospitality, as always.

Something strange happened, however; at one point Dumac and all his entourage went silent for a minute or more, staring into nothing.

During the eerie silence both Voryn and I felt a sharp pain under our eyelids, and the world flickered at the edges of our vision.

A heavy strangeness came over the revelers, that persisted through the night.

Kagrenac appeared briefly to greet us, holding a dagger so bizarre, I could barely take my eyes away as the world shimmered around it.

Voryn saw it too, and when our eyes next met, it was like gazing into something like my very own.
