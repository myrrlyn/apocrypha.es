*My last attempts were a bust. I think there must be some sort of mistranslation in some of Varn's books, because none of my walking-like-other people or mantle-wearing worked and I'm still not a god. But! I found other things to try in these weird books with black covers that Varn keeps under his bed.*

*Soul-stacking seemed easy enough, but the problem is the books never say how high you're supposed to stack them. I bought tons of soul gems from that shop-keep who sold me the helmet, and he swore they were all real and filled with souls, so I think the problem is that I just can't stack them high enough before the pile falls over. I need to get some flatter soul-gems before I can try soul-stacking again.*

*Stacking things looks like a big part of being a god, cause it also said I could "reach heaven by violence" and then I'd be a god and then everything would be great. I put a lot of thought into it and I think what you're supposed to do is beat up a lot of people, make a pile of them, and climb it up to Aetherius where Akatosh and Dibella and everyone will get together and make you a god as a reward. I was gonna try this, but I figured I wouldn't get that far before people started to wake up and then the pile would fall over. Currently investing in glue, gonna try with the soul gems first.*

*There's also some nonsense here about Chim, but when I asked a friend about it he just said that "As Chim as you get, you can never be Chim-est because Vivec's even Chimer than you." I don't get it.*
