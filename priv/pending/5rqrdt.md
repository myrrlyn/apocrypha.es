Travath Maseleh (priest)

Born to unrecorded parents outside a fishing village in Lower Deshaan in 3E33. Served the Tribunal Temple and earned the Acolyte's robe 3E80, Disciple's ring 3E90. Recognized by House Dres as Captain of Poets, revoked posthumously. Sent to Leyawiin on a special ambassadorship in 3E93, where he defected his mission and founded the heretical Accretion Academy (affectionately called the Nestmakers of the Niben). Married 3E101 to Ianina, a minor noble of Leyawiin. No children.

In Leyawiin the outcast Maseleh taught poetic composition, calligraphy, coraclemaking, and pioneered an obscure school of forgetting-and-remembering magic that has disappeared from use. Spell scrolls made by his hand feature fantastic birds, stylized feathers and beaks, solar imagery, mirrored writing, palindromes, and annular orthography. Of his students only a few are known, and those are in the ledger of County Leyawiin as infamous bandits or rogue wizards.

After the death of Pelagius III and ascension of Katariah in 3E153, presumably to make amends, Maseleh sailed around Black Marsh to Mournhold and then traveled by foot to Vivec City where he died of old age. No body was returned, however. A waiting door erected in a river grotto near his birthplace bears his name and is notable for having none of his remains. Incense burned at his empty tomb is added to an ashpit of local ancestor bones. The superstitious Dunmer fisherfolk claim that making offerings during seasonal floods grants miraculous elocution, and every year several poets disappear chasing immortality.
