Orc king, Gortwog gro-Nagorm, gathered all the shaman priests of Orsinium that day and promised a revelation: *"Let me tell you of the vision i had, let me tell you of a secret door that was open in front of me to see the past, let me show you that our God lives, let me share with you what Trinimac showed me."*

*****

**DAGON**: *What time is it?*


**SHEOG**: *Too soon demon.*


**BAL**: *What or who are we waiting for?*


**DAGON**: *The Return of the Mac, I guess?*


**SHEOG**: *Cheesy!*


**Mauloch**: *Apologies for the delay, Nords again at Dragon wall!*


**DAGON**: *8 years to travel east? Should’ve make it 6, fits nicely with the upcoming war.*



**BAL**: *You seem to know what this is Mad God, don’t test my spear!*


**TriniMalac**: *This is about my revenge, the Heart and the testing of Veloth teachings.*


**SHEOG**:

*Easy there dirtpile, you temper is surely vile*

*It may be the Mac is back, but I will do all the hack*
 
*Timing is key, and I will need your thunder*

*Fittingly it is, the year of winter in summer*




**Dumalacath**: *I see the deep ones’ souls have made it to the skin, under my sulphurous sky I shall eat their Soulless King and wait for Boethiah’s son to visit me with his questions. He’ll never recognize a Dwarf-Orc when blinded by love with his Dwarf-King.*



**SHEOG**:

*Not so bad for a Bal Masqué,*

*I’ll be in Azura’s temple sacré*

*Where he consults for his tribe's fate*

*Mad God pops and hacks the date*

*It’s war they want and war they get*

*When prophecy comes, scheme is set*


**DAGON**: *Where do I fit in?*

**BAL**: *Patience! When I lay my stone in the liar’s womb, and the Mad God tricks it to come in blaze, wait for this Rock to Lie, for Truth will fall when prayers stop.*  


**SHEOG**: *That takes care of our three troubling sisters, until the new temple comes with the prophecy fulfilled. It's time to dance.*
