On Wasabi: Being a Treatise on the Nature and History of Wasabi by Volundr of Winterhold
----
Too long have I heard wasabi called "Nord root paste" by ignorant outlanders. They say that it is made by "crushing roots" or "letting plants rot underground for a few months", belittling one of Skyrim's oldest and most cherished arts. The foolish puritans of Cyrodiil compare it to Skooma and demand that the Empire outlaw it. What follows is my attempt to enlighten the people of Tamriel about the true nature of wasabi and its significance to the Children of Kyne.

**The Nature of Wasabi**

Wasabi is more than simple crushed and fermented roots, it is an artful mix of various vegetables, fungi, spices, sauces(often fish sauces and sometimes pieces of fish), and roots. This mix is sealed inside an urn and left to ferment over a period of months. After it is done fermenting, it is then ground into a fine paste and traditionally  mixed with ground ice wraith teeth or frost salts and stored inside special containers made of hollowed out boar's tusks, crafted so as to have a vacuum seal cap. Wasabi recipes vary from tribe to tribe, with some including exotic and rare ingredients. Wasabi recipes are often jealously guarded and the location of fermenting grounds are kept secret from outsiders. Many different types of wasabi are made in Skyrim, and are used in various types of cuisine, worship, and warfare.


**The History of Wasabi**

The preparation and consumption of wasabi dates back to Merethic Atmora. Legend tells of Clever-King Fohrii receiving the first recipe from Dibella on the banks of the Greenwound River. The Clever-King's lands were destitute, having little to offer to the dragons as tribute. While attempting to drown himself in despair, Dibella appeared to Fohrii in the form of a she-dragon surrounded by a halo of moths. She told him of a holy garnish eaten in Sovngarde by Shor's most favored berserkers. When the dragons came to collect Fohrii's tithe, he offered up jars of wasabi. The dragons were surprisingly pleased with his tribute and instead of razing his keep and villages, they rewarded Fohrii with enchanted weapons to be used in raids (so that he could collect an even greater offering for the next time they visited).

Wasabi was (and to an extent still is) considered a form of communion with the Totem Gods. For years, the preparation of wasabi was reserved for nobility and clergy of the Dragon Cult, and was only consumed by laymen and commoners during warfare and special holidays. The cultivation of wasabi was seen as both a holy ritual and a sophisticated art, akin to Khajiiti moon sugar rituals and Orcish smithing. The consumption of certain varieties of wasabi was restricted to royalty, high priests, and dragons. During this time, a special aesthetic ritual was devised for the serving of wasabi at feasts.

When Ysgramor and his 500 Companions conquered Skyrim, they used wasabi as a frenzy-inducing drug during battle. Wasabi continued to be used by warriors, nobles, and priests before, during, and after the Dragon War.

During the Early Third Era, High King Borri issued the Wasabi Cultivar Decree, legalizing the consumption of many types of wasabi by all Nords. However, he also restricted the making of certain types of wasabi to licensed artisans.

Wasabi continues to be a major Nord art into the modern era. Lately, lesser types of wasabi have been exported to Tamriel at large. However, critics of Nord culture in Cyrodiil and High Rock have called for the Empire to make this most sacred substance illegal. This movement is based on nothing but rumor, it is a form of mass hysteria founded on the offensive and incorrect comparison of wasabi to skooma. Spice merchants also have reason to oppose the wasabi trade, as it often serves as competition for their own garnishes.


**Varieties of Wasabi**

Wasabi craft is an ancient and diverse art, so there are hundreds of recipes. What follows is but a small selection of wasabi types.

* *Petty Wasabi*: Petty wasabi is the most common type of wasabi and holds little to no ritual significance to the people of Skyrim. However, its creation is still a time consuming and delicate process, resulting in a relatively high price outside of Skyrim. While most types of wasabi use nirnroot or other types of root, Petty Wasabi uses mammoth radishes, a relative of horseradish that has been domesticated. It is this type of wasabi that is often exported to the rest of Tamriel.

* *Nirn Wasabi*: Nirn Wasabi is an expensive type of wasabi often reserved for feasts. It uses nirnroot instead of mammoth radish and is fermented for much longer. It is traditionally eaten alongside smoked fish. This type of wasabi fetches extremely high prices both in Skyrim and the rest of Tamriel.

* *Red Wasabi*: Red Wasabi is never eaten outside of battle and is never exported outside of Skyrim. It has a distinctive crimson hue and extremely strong scent. It uses Fly Amanita stems and Blisterwort caps, alongside several types of spices and alchemical ingredients. It is only prepared by licensed artisans who are trained in alchemy. It is applied to the rim of shields before battle. Upon consumption, it induces both a resistance to pain and violent(but not uncontrollable) anger.

* *Eyebleed*: A liquid byproduct of the creation of Red Wasabi. Eyebleed is used as a weapon of war and is never consumed. Pots and jars of eyebleed are flung at enemies, causing painful coughing and temporary blindness. Outside of warfare, it is used to drive away dangerous predators, deterring even trolls and frostbite spiders.

* *Wasabi Soma*: Wasabi Soma a legendary type of wasabi consumed by heroes, nobility, powerful mages, and mountain ascetics. It is mixed with mead and drunk only very rarely and few know the exact method of its preparation. This type of wasabi is purported to extend the life of those who consume it, confer great strength and resistance to pain, and bring about holy visions.
