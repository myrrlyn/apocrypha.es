**Count Reyner and the Daedra: A Children’s Tale**

*By Charlon Verrier, Vigilant of Stendarr*

*Evermore, 4E23*

So, little one, have you ever heard of the bad creatures that are called *''Daedra’’*? I’m sure you have; after all, they bug us hardworking people so much, that not many do not know them! Apart from bugging, Daedra also lie a lot. They are like bad friends; they promise you very nice stuff, but they never end up giving you that stuff. Do you have friends like that? They are a bit like the Daedra. These bad creatures do not only promise stuff, but also other nice things. There once was a count called Reyner, who listened to what a Daedra said. The Daedra said that if Reyner helped him, he would in turn give him more land and power. Reyner was a dumb man, and wanted more power; he was angry at his neighbours because they would never cut the grass on their lands, and he wanted their lands to do that himself then. The Daedra wanted Reyner to do many bad things, and hurt many people. Reyner did so, and thought it was good of him to do so; after all, the Daedra would give him what he wanted as well. Do you think this was smart of Reyner? Then one day, the Daedra asked Reyner to summon him, and promised him that he would help him get power then. Reyner agreed, and listened to the Daedra. When he summoned the Daedra, the evil creature burned Reyner alive, and caught his soul forever. Reyner did not get any of what the Daedra promised him, and the Daedra then bugged the people of Reyner’s lands some more. So you see, little one, that the Daedra lie a lot, and you should not listen to their promises. Also, never summon them. It does not end well. Be a good child, and pray a lot to the real Divines; only they look out for you.
