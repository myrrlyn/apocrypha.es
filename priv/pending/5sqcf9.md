The calling of simple priesthood is a blessed one indeed, but there are a few things you must know as you start your life tending to your people's needs of faith. 

First, you must be kind and concerned in your disposition towards everyone you deal with, at all times, putting aside your internal reluctances. Doing so not only helps improve the stead of the priesthood in the eyes of the people, but also is a spiritual practice itself, and bestows upon the faithful the graces of Mara. 

Second, you should acquaint yourself with the basics of healing, alchemy, rituals to each of the Beloved regardless of mother school, and magical blessings. Being in isolated settlements far away from large towns will necessitate that in the absence of more specific healers, you will have to be a able to provide the basic medical and religious needs of your congregation. 

Thirdly, devotionals to Arkay each day, preferably before the sun rises, are of great benefit, as the Lord of Cycles watches over the holy priesthood, and has a special fondness for the Nine's servants who minister to the more isolated of Their children. 

Finally, always have in your heart only the love of creation, and take care to treat all provisions, including our sacred Mother Empire, as a gift to be respected and nurtured. If done so, you will find many moments of joy during your life as a helper and seeker, and not even the most vile of prince will be able to destroy you. 

Akatosh and Arkay be with you.
