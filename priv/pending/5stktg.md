Shrine of Saint Veloth, 1E ???


"So commences session number three. Bring him back again."


*Wh- what is this? Where am I?*


"That matters not. The Tribunal willed this session. Baleth, engage the Rack!"


*Aaaaah! Who are you to torment me so?*


"Servants of your rightful lords, spirit."


*What do you want of me?*


"Who are you, spirit?"


*I... I was someone. I was a leader. I was Veloth.*


"No. You are Saint Veloth of the Tribunal Temple."


*What is this nonsense? My Gods are the Daedra-aaahh!*

"That, spirit, is our Soul Rack. Every time you answer incorrectly, you will be treated."


*Gah! By Azura, make it stop!*


"Invoke not the heathen gods, spirit. That will merely prolong your exposure."


*My people shall avenge me for this injustice, knave!*


"You have no people, spirit. You are but the spirit of Saint Veloth, and you exist by the will of the Tribunal."

*Never!*

"You are ready, scribe? Very well. Let us commence session two hundred and sixty. Conjure his essence, summoner."


*You have returned me again, then. Very well. How many times have you tortured me now? Twenty? Thirty?*


"Somewhat more than that, spirit. Let us begin. What is your name?"


*I... I am Saint Veloth! I follow the Daedra, not your Azura-cursed imitations! I-ahh!*


"You remember my predecessors' arsenals of reconditioning devices? Since I took office, I expanded somewhat. You are now experiencing my Essence Sieve. Answer my questions correctly, and you will be allowed to return to your eversleep. Understand?"


*No, I- ahh! Yes, yes!*


"Who are the true Gods of this land?"


*My lords Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura-aahh!*


"Who are the true Gods of this land?"


*The Daedra! The good Daedra!*


"You lie. The Daedra murder and decieve! I will ask you once more. Summoner, engage the Sieve. Who are the true Gods of this land?"


*Nnngh! The... The three goo-ahh!* *The three..*

"And so commences session one thousand and eight. And, by the will of the Tribunal, the last necessary. Have you prepared yourself?"


*I have, Archcanon. By the will of the Tribunal.*


"Worry not, Saint. This is merely a formality. And now, question the first. Who are the true Gods of this land?"


*The Tribunal.*


"Very good, spirit. What of the Daedra? Why are they unsuitable for worship?"


*The Daedra are foul murderers! They lie and decieve, and cannot be trusted.*


"Your wisdom grows immeasurably, Saint Veloth! And now for one final question: why do you support the Tribunal?"


*My people have always... have always adapted. We used to worship the good Daedra, but that time has passed. The Tribunal are the only true Gods of my people.*


"Very well, Veloth. You may take your leave. May the grace of Almalexia be with you."


*Praises to the Three.*
