1. When AKA gave his gifts onto Nirn, he sundered into many fragments, some sympathetic to Mortality, and some who shunned the gifts they had been given.

2. The first of these fragments was Auri-El, the Eagle-Once-Dragon, who fled to the western islands and gave his blessing upon the mortals who lived there, who would become the Old Elves. He shunned the gift of Mortality and spent his years seeking a return to Stasis.

3. The second of these fragments was Alkosh, the Lion-Once-Dragon, who fled to the southern reaches of Tamriel and blessed the mortals who wandered the deserts, who would become the Beast People. He shunned Mortality, but instead blessed his people to make the most of their limited lives

4. The third of these fragments was Al-Du-In, the Destroy-Devour-Master, who fled to the northern frosts beyond the coasts of Tamriel, and who conquered the mortals who made their home there, who would become the Atmorans. He embraced Mortality, but only for vile purposes.

5. The fourth of these fragments was Tosh-Raka, the Dragon-Once-Tiger, who fled to the far east of Akavir and blessed the mortals who lived there, who would become the Serpent People. He embraced Mortality, believing that mortals should emulate the actions of the gods rather than the elements of them.

6. The fifth of these fragments was Ruptga, the Towering Father, who fled to the far west of Yokuda and blessed the mortals who lived there, who would become the Red Guard. He shunned Mortality, but instead blessed the mortals under his care with long lives.

7. The sixth and final of these fragments was Akatosh, the Man-Once-Dragon, who did not flee but settled in the jungle-now-forest of Cyrodiil and blessed the mortals who lived there, who would become the Nedes. He embraced Mortality, seeing it as a gift that the gods should envy.

8. The fragments of AKA saw that their fracturing was good, and they told their brothers and sisters, who had become the Gifted Limbs; “Join us in our fractured state, for it will open us to more possibility and change.”

9. And so the seven Gifted Limbs, who were ZEN, JHUNAL, ARKAY, MHARA, KYNE, STUHN and DIBELLA, fractured themselves into many forms and spread across the mortal world, blessing the races of Nirn.

10. And AKA saw that this was good, and thus he gave unto Nirn the gift of the Divines.
