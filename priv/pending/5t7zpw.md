# Southern Colovian History
## By Thagor Mivellus, Winterhold College, 4E231

## Foreword
When I approached the Winterhold College's archmage with my request for a one-year leave so I could work on my (now published; you hold it in your hands) comprehensive overview on southern Colovian history, she just smiled and provocatively asked: "Does Cyrodiilian history at all really still matter?" I raised my eyebrow and said nothing. Indeed: Maybe we have entered a completely new era in which the fate of our ancestors may be a theme of stories and songs for entertaining the youth and hobby historians like myself, but has no further relevance to our own lives. Why should my college fund my personal interest in that?

I left and went away to think further about my request and a reason why the archmage should agree. The more I reflected on my intentions, the more I focused on one fact: Tamrielic history in general and Cyrodiilian history in particular have long been written for propaganda purposes, thereby losing grip on what really happened and on what might be learned from that - especially how false beliefs and behaviors led to our fall, and which we therefore have to avoid in the future, such as the false worship of emperor Tiber Septim as so-called Talos.

What started out as a promising new empire, dedicated to the eight divines, got perverted as the emperor "ascended to godhood". Centuries of decline followed this, culminating in the Oblivion crisis, leaving a weak state unable to prevent or to react on further events such as the Red Year or separatist movements such as the Stormcloak rebellion (that thankfully never was strong enough to be a real danger). It is only thanks to the generosity of the Aldmeri Dominion that the empire still exists and has stabilized again. Guided by the wisdom, the compassion and the friendship of our Thalmor allies, the renewed empire has finally returned to the eight divines, and we, the peoples united under the empire's banner, have understood that Tiber Septim, although a successful ruler when alive, never stood by our side after his death, not because he did not want to, or because he was a bad ruler (which he wasn't), but because _he simply couldn't_. Tiber Septim was a mortal, an impressive one for sure. But Tiber Septim was never Talos. The hopes we burdend him with simply could not be fulfilled. Accepting this truth has been the first step of our redemption, and we are now aware enough of our failures, and strong enough in our hearts and minds that we can begin to re-evaluate the long decline of the Empire.

And _this_ indeed matters. Understanding what led to false claims of godhood and what planted the seed of decline into the empire's soil right after its birth will prevent us, the people of the new empire, from rejecting again the eight divines and our Aldmeri friends. Only then we can expect to have a lasting place in this world, where safety and prosperity can rule, a place that fits us, mortal men, in our humility.

I returned to the archmage and she thankfully shared my view. She granted my leave and I set out to a long journey to Skingrad where I stayed for the upcoming months. I talked with a lot of folk there, visited libraries and historic places, as well as villages and other towns near Gold Road and Gold Coast. Day by day, and month by month small pieces started to connect to a bigger image which I finally can share with you, esteemed reader. Southern Colovia may just be one region in Cyrodiil, but it was central to our history. Its analysis may serve as an example for future studies on other parts of the empire.


## Thanks and Dedication

I want to thank everybody who supported me during this endeavour, but especially the local Thalmor representatives in Skingrad, Anvil and Sutch who provided me with important documents which, to my knowledge, have never been published or discussed before. I dedicate this volume to all of them. 

Most importantly, though, I dedicate this work to you, the peoples of the new empire, standing united in peace.

This is one of your _true_ stories.
