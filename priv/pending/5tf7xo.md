*By Orvas Dathren, priest at the Shrine of Saint Jiub, 4E 204*

Most of you have heard of Saint Jiub the Eradicator, Hero of Morrowind and Saviour of the Dunmer, and you are probably familiar with his holy quest against the Winged Menace. However, how many of you know of his philosophical endeavours? Saint Jiub was not a mere champion of brute force, but a hard-working scholar and a sagacious thinker that could cut the veil of ignorance with the sharp edge of revelation.

Hearken now to the words of Saint Jiub the Magnificent, he who taught much wisdom to Nerevar Reborn, Vivec and Ysmir of the North.

&gt; *I miss my homeland,*    
&gt; *but I can't say*    
&gt; *that I miss all the noise.*    

Even when he was far away, Saint Jiub had his country and his people in his heart. However, such love did not blind him to the flaws of his homeland. The word “noise” here is an obvious reference to all the religious and political squabbling that has plagued Morrowind for millennia. In a daring statement, the Eradicator tells us that we must not put our petty differences before the common good, lest we chase away the very people that could help us.

&gt; *'Savior of Morrowind.'*     
&gt; *That's good but it sounds*     
&gt; *too narrow of scope.*     

Saint Jiub loved his country, yes, but he also despised narrow-minded provincialism. Humble as always, he remarks that being considered the saviour of his homeland is inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. Is it righteous to be content in our own peace while the rest of the world suffers? Saint Jiub says: “no, it is not”. That he found his demise defending the innocents of the Empire of Men against the hordes of Oblivion should shame those who turn their backs on the other races. Uncivilized as they may be, they are equally deserving of protection.

&gt; *Stand up.*    
&gt; *There you go.*     
&gt; *You were dreaming.*    

Much ink has been spilled over the first encounter between the two greatest heroes of Morrowind: the Nerevarine and Saint Jiub. The words of the Eradicator are full of mystery and symbolism, and scholars today still argue about their meaning. The most widespread school of thought theorizes that Saint Jiub is acting here as Voice of Morrowind and Second Prophet. He guides Nerevar Reborn in the process of shaking off the chains of the Prisoner (“Stand up”), performs the Call to Action that turns a mortal into Hero of Prophecy (“There you go”) and hints at the fleeting nature of reality and the transmigration of souls from Aetherius (“You were dreaming”).

A more radical school goes further and argues that before that moment the spirit of Nerevar was floating in the Dream beyond reality, formless and nameless. That the Hero of Prophecy did not even exist in the material world until Saint Jiub’s call made it possible. If that were true, the Magnificent would be thrice-blessed and the only mortal to truly understand the mysteries of Incarnation.

It is never late to change your path. Follow the wisdom of Saint Jiub and be redeemed!
