&gt;#The Requisite Book of Daedra, Peryite Section
&gt;##Anonymous

[This volume is an encyclopedic reference to the Lords of the Daedric Realms, their chief clans, the themes and spheres of influence of each clan, and to the legends and lore associated with those mortals who traffick with Daedra.]

#PERYITE Heading
Peryite, whose spheres are the ordering of the lowest orders of the Oblivion, pestilence, disease, natural order, tasks, the law of equivalent exchange, the culling of mortals and immortals, hierarchy, slavery and slave-drivers, integrity, and falling rock.

Peryite, who is also known by the monikers of the Taskmaster, the Imposter, the Blighted Lord, the Father of Bad Luck, the Great Culler, the Pear-You-Eat, the Creator of Cures, the Causer of Contagions, Oblivion’s Warden, the Sewer Keeper, the Master Collector, the Honest Dragon, and Fallen Rock.

Peryite, whose realm is known as the Pits and is completely inaccessible to mortals, also known as Hell and the Infernal Pits.

Peryite, whose wives are Meridia, Mephala, and Namira, in contrast to his mirror-sibling Akatosh and his wives Kynareth, Mara, and Dibella.

Peryite, whose enemies are Ebonarm and Vaermina, and whose allies are Clavicus Vile and Hircine.

To Peryite belongs these clans: Clan DULLSCALE of the DREMORA CLAN, Clan DRAKETOOTH of the DREMORA CLAN, Clan BRITTLESTONE, and Clan BATRACHITE of the DREMORA CLAN. (NOTICE: All clans sworn to Peryite have underwent vestige manipulation and are thought of as a suborder of the DREMORA CLAN; their piercing yellow eyes, pale skin, and oozing green armor that has melded with their skin denotes their service to Peryite, as it has since they gave him their nymic-oaths in the days before the FALL OF LYG)

The Duties of Clan DULLSCALE are as follows: To properly raise, cull, and synergize daedrons into new bacteria, to properly catalogue every disease – anatomical and worldly – in a concise consensus, to test new and old diseases upon themselves to determine their effectiveness, and unleash bacteria into the Mundus and the rest of Oblivion at optimal times at the behest of the Blighted Lord.

The Duties of Clan DRAKETOOTH are as follows: To properly analyze and experiment upon localized bacteria and events in order to create cures for potential nuisances to Lord Peryite’s plans, to concoct potions and alchemical brews and test them upon themselves in order to properly create these cures, and to release these cures into the Mundus and the rest of Oblivion at optimal times at the behest of the Blighted Lord.

The Duties of Clan BRITTLESTONE are as follows: To maintain balance in the Oblivion and upon Mundus through subtle and not-so subtle acts, to ensure the Lords of Tumult do not intrude upon one another too much or too little, to ensure mortals do not overstep or underestimate themselves, and to provide diplomatic services to those realms Lord Peryite does not govern and to provide governance to those that fall under his sway (which is many).

The Duties of Clan BATRACHITE are as follows: To locate and destroy realm rips in the Oblivion, Mundus, and occasionally Aetherius, to censure portals that do not have the proper clearance, and to otherwise aid mortals and other immortals with their plans less they interfere with the Will of Lord Peryite, which results in self-termination.

To Peryite belongs these species of Daedra: the PLAGUE ATRONACH, the DAEDRAT, the PUS TITAN, the ARCHIVIST, and the PUSS-RIDDEN:

The PLAGUE ATRONACH, found originally in the realm known as the OOZING MIRE and the PITS, whose forms are generated from stray daedrons and semi-sentient daedrons that form an intelligent collective conscious. Claimed by Lord Peryite.

The DAEDRAT, found in all realms of the Oblivion and created by Lord Peryite. Their rotting fur and skin holds the cures to a thousand infections, but their breath can cause a thousand more. Claimed by Lord Peryite; often mutated by Molag Bal, Namira, and Mehrunes Dagon in their foolhardy attempts to usurp him.

The PUS TITAN, found only in the PITS and those realms governed by Lord Peryite, mutated and modified by him from the DAEDRIC TITANS created by Molag Bal. Highly intelligent and possessing a constant tranquil rage, their bodies covered in constantly bursting pustules that spray foul, acidic liquids. They also have the ability to discharge sewerage from their mouths. Claimed by Lord Peryite; often found to be in the service of Namira as well.

The ARCHIVIST, found originally in the realm known as the FIFTH APERTURE OF KNOWLEDGE and the PITS, as well as wandering Oblivion. Humanoid insect-like entities as black as the night, with six eyes the color of the rainbow, four muscular arms, and sharp razor-like mandibles. They are fond of cataloguing everything in existence and ordering those without order; known to experiment upon mortals and immortals alike for some obscure purpose. They are a Hive Mind that follows orders from the ARCHIVIST QUEEN. Claimed by Lord Peryite; sometimes found in the possession of Hermaeus Mora as well.

The PUS-RIDDEN, created by Lord Peryite and scattered throughout the PITS. Originally were mortals that entered into his service willingly in death to uphold the natural order. Are derelict, fragile beings possessing incredible strength and speed as well as bodies constantly in a rough state of decaying perfection. Vestige insertion allows them to be reborn in the PITS upon death like natural Daedra. Claimed by Lord Peryite.

To Peryite are these artifacts – the SPELLBREAKER, the MIRROR OF HARD TRUTHS, and DENSTAGMER’S RING:

SPELLBREAKER, shield forged by DWEMER and crafted by Lord Peryite as the price for his aid in their endeavors. Capable of blocking any weapon made from any metal, and can silence any spell instantly or generate a ward that can do so. In the right hands, and by that the hands of one who truly understands natural order, the SPELLBREAKER can bring order to chaos, chaos to order, cure or inflict illness, and open or close rips in time and space. Much sought after for its power, but can only be found by those who do not crave it.

The MIRROR OF HARD TRUTHS, made by the Altmeri god PHYNASTER during his days as a mortal, and eventually became the cause of his undoing after Lord Peryite enchanted it after he became disgusted by his vanity. Reveals whatever truth the wielder unknowingly seeks no matter how terrible or painful it is. The cause of many suicides and wars on the Mundus, and eventually shattered into four pieces and acquired by the Psijic Order in order to prevent more devastation.

DENSTAGMER’S RING, an enchanted ring that once belonged to the famous Nord warrior DENSTAGMER in the First Era, who summoned Peryite and asked for his help in attaining immunity to all elements so he could become perfect. Lord Peryite did this and gave the ring the ability to protect the wielder from the forces of nature, but cursed it so it would allow even the smallest physical pain to kill the wielder. Denstagmer later died from a rock thrown by a Snow Elf child upon trying to avenge his people killed in the Night of Tears, and the RING has passed from hand to hand through the centuries since
