Preparations
----
**1) First you must give away or destroy all your worldly possessions and consign yourself to the wilderness.** 

**2) Second, you must eat of the brain and eyes of a hare and leave the offal for the hawks.**

**3) Third, you must bathe naked in a freezing river.**

**4) Lastly, while bathing in the river, you must envision three figures: yourself, a stranger, and a dragon. Your double is you past self, exile him from you sight. The stranger is uncertainty, murder him. The dragon is your future, consume it. Thus, you have severed your limitations, escaped your doubt, and embraced your rebirth.**

**5) Having unmoored yourself from the world, you are ready to climb a mountain and sit in silence for nine days.**
