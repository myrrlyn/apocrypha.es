Voryn has told me he thinks Kagrenac doing something highly unethical in Red Mountain.  He refuses to tell me how and what he specifically knows but his tone had the ring of truth, and I trust him.

It turns out that the strange visual phenomena has torn through the Chimer.  There were also signs of certain Chimer falling extremely ill, some with no sign of improvement in days.

The most severe cases seem to run in families, many of them are known to have intermarried with Dwemer over generations.

I hope Seht is well.
