The strange episodes still happen, but most victims have grown accustomed to them.  The most severe cases continue to waste away, but curiously, none have died in the months since these started happening.

The sickest have been having nightmares.  They talk in their sleep.  They all say the same things, and they make no sense at all:

“Love the Walk-Brass who is our freedom.”

“Make ourselves anew.”

“Quilt a Nymic for Numidium,      
Numidium will cut a Nymic from the Night.     
The Deep Ones delve into the depths,     
Transcending life by ending Death.”     

There are a good number of young children who are sleeptalking as such and their parents rightly find it very upsetting.

Voryn thinks I should press Dumac more aggressively for answers, but I think that is a step that must be taken with absolute care.
