*(An old tale among the bards of Cyrodiil and High Rock, there are several versions of it, sometimes with prophet Marukh himself as the Archimonk of the story. Its historicity is in doubt, but all versions are set during the Alessian Order’s theocratic control of the Imperial Province)*

It was the age of the Seventy-Seven Inflexible Doctrines, the Exclusionary Mandates and the Expungement of the Taint. And expunged it was, from the temples, from the names, from history itself, with holy fire if needed. Prophet Most Simian had said: “All are guilty until they have proven themselves innocent”. And many were found guilty in those times.

One day, the Archimonk asked: “Is Music corrupted by the Elven taint? Because I do not see its use, except to distract and make the faithful forget their sacred duties”.

He was right to ask, because the slaves before Al-Esh had enjoyed the music and poetry of their former masters and made it their own, and it was also the age of the Direnni and their romances, and the wind carried the beautiful and infectious musical notes of Elven East, Elven South and Elven West too. So the Archimonk announced that Music itself would stand trial and that, if found guilty, it would be removed from the world.

Nobles and commoners alike were anguished, but nobody dared to go against the Order. Nobody but Lucina of Cheydinhal, the fairest and bravest of all the bards in Cyrodiil.

When the day of the trial came, Lucina stood before the Archimonk and said:

“I will speak for Music”. 

And the Archimonk nodded, but warned her that she would be found guilty too if she could not prove her innocence.

Lucina took her harp and sang the most beautiful love story ever penned by Elven writers, its charm so great that everyone but the Archimonk was moved to tears. But the judge remained unshaken, chastised the rest for their childish sensitivity and said:

“The Elves sing of capricious selfishness and emotional decadence. Al-Esh did not fight so we would mimic the corrupted ways of Aurielic worshippers. You and your cursed Music should die”.

“There is music that does not come from the Elves and does not share their decadence”, answered Lucina. “I will show you”.

She took her drum and sang the heroic tales of the Nord warriors that came with Ysgramor to liberate Mereth, their feats so glorious that everyone but the Archimonk imagined themselves marching against the cruel Falmer and building a new empire of Man. But the judge remained unshaken, chastised the rest for their youthful passion and said:

“The Nords sing of brute force and rapacious barbarism. Al-Esh did not fight so we would mimic those uncivilized enough to mistake the Supreme Spirit for a World-Eater. You and your cursed Music should die”.

All looked at Lucina and feared the worst, but she took her lute and sang once more.

This time she did not use songs written by others, but by herself. She sang about Akatosh and his Covenant with Al-Esh, her voice so spiritual that everyone, including the Archimonk, felt their faith in the Supreme Spirit increase with each passing verse. When Lucina ended, the judge applauded her.

“You sing of holiness and Proper-Life. Al-Esh fought so we would praise He who is of unitary essence. You and your blessed Music should live”.

There was much rejoicing and bards all over the Empire started writing hymns in honour of the gods. The Elvish influences would be expunged, yes, but Music would live on to illuminate the souls of Men. The Alessian Order itself would embrace it as another weapon in their fight against the Taint, praising the Supreme Spirit, the Singularity Misplaced, Al-Esh and Prophet Most Simian.

As for Lucina of Cheydinhal, she was executed the day after the trial. For she had been found guilty twice, but innocent only once.
