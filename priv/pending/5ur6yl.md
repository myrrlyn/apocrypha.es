Vehk has returned! And as I have feared, Seht has been quite sick.

Although he looks somewhat wasted, it is not as severe as with others afflicted.  He says his time with the Psijics has shielded him from the worst.  He has, however, acknowledged the sleep talking and nightmares.

Ayem then whisked Seht off to her private suites, tending to him day and night with the help of Vehk.

I would prefer to help them, and I could certainly use their counsel, but Dumac will be received in Mournhold tomorrow to explain these events.

Voryn and Alandro will attend me.
