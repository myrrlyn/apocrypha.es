An Account of Death - by Cleric Fontibus

Fourth Era, 172nd Year 

Cyrodiil, Cheydinhal 

&amp;nbsp;



From my homes window I see rows upon rows of newly inducted Legionnaires march in formation, headed for the city's gates, to no doubt combat the Thalmor. What many of these Legionnaires fear is death itself, the veterans try to quell these fears with sage advice, but to no avail. Many are the young ones. They've only seen there twentieth year and yet, they readily volunteer themselves to march to war. 


Some believe (like myself) that we return to Aetherius. Our memories themselves being washed in the waters Of Nirn (while i've inquired with my fellow clerics multiple times on this, no one can get a clear picture on what these 'waters' are) some belive that it is the literal waters of Nirn, others believe that it is some sort of ever flowing river or lake within the starbound realms of Aetherius. However, most of all no one knows. 



Some believe that when they die, they enter what's known as 'The Dreamless Black'. That means when you die, you die. Your memories are not washed into the Waters, but are gone forever. 



(May I also remind our clerics and priests that its is **not** appropriate to judge another person's beliefs, while this is a house for the Divines, we are to welcome everyone to our door, including those that don't belive in what we do.)




Some say that Nords are welcomed into Sovngarde, while books have been published on that matter it is still an unknown quantity. What we should be asking ourselves is 'why and how'. As in, why do some Nord Souls travel to Sovngarde, while others go to Aetherius? And more importantly, can a member of the non-nords (such as Bretons, Mer and Beast races) choose to enter Sovngarde if they have proven themselves worthy? 



I realize this may raise more questions then answers. But do you know what my answer is? Its up to you. We currently don't know the full scope of all of this. As it always has been and as it always will be, things in this world will always be up to your decisions and your choices. It is up to you to choose the right answer.
