Dumac was attended by Kagrenac, a surprise most unpleasant but a wise choice given many Chimer blame the Tonal Architects for the sickness sweeping through Resdayn.

Kagrenac insisted his work has nothing to do with these nightmares, suggesting that local Khajiit be investigated for selling Skooma to children and to inquire about Hist-interference in our territories.

Both suggestions are preposterous, and I told him so loudly.  The Chimer cheered me, and I asked the First Council to discuss a joint investigation of Red Mountain to get to the heart of these phenomena.

Dumac raised the topic of the Nords and energetic anomalies detected by his brethren in Skyrim.  The Dwemer cheered him, for they had little love of the humans who invaded and upset their dominance over the Falmer and their lands.

Voryn volunteered to investigate the Nords, but only  if the Chimer and Dwemer could work together to investigate the sleeping sickness.  Dumac and I agreed, embracing before our tribes.  The court reverberated with cheers, jeers and the thumping of weapons against shield or floor.  Kagrenac scowled, as he always does.

Alandro sat in silence, his hands still in his lap, so focused I swear he was trying to memorize every detail.
