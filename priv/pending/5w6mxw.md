Voryn is in my bed, fast asleep.  He leaves tomorrow to investigate the Shaggy men.  He is beautiful in the torch light.

I can't sleep.  This whole night I have felt a crushing weight that I cannot shake.

I feel like we are on the cusp of a change that is as irrevocable as it is inevitable.

As Hortator, my House is the provisional House.  Like the great Veloth before me, I must lead the Chimer, I must provide for the Chimer, and I must protect the Chimer.

I have no idea how to do this.  It is all ash blowing through my fingers.  Voryn is ash blowing through my fingers.

I don't want to lose him.  I don't want to lose anyone.
