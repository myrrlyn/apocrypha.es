To all Legionnaires,

We have been receiving reports of rumors concerning the skeletal warriors which we have recently fielded. These rumors must stop, as not only are they unfounded, but they are damaging to morale.

So, let us clarify: these Skeletal Warriors are the resurrected dead of our Legion; they are not bodies dug up from desecrated graves, nor are they taken from those who yet live. As you may have heard from your commanding officers and from fliers, these resurrected bodies have been imbued with the souls of those brave soldiers who have pledged to die twicefold for the legion, and the skeletons themselves come from the same stock. We assure you that once each resurrected warrior is felled, they are granted the proper rights of Arkay, to sleep the eternal sleep.

The Legion will no longer tolerate these rumors of Daedric influence or corpse desecration concerning the Skeletal Warriors and Anchorites who serve in our legion. To speak ill of the Resurrected is to speak will of the dead - to speak ill of those who have so selflessly allowed themselves to be subjected to battle and death twice as many times as the rest of you. Furthermore, keep in mind the Fellowship of the Anchorites are the Empire's authority on the Arcane. They have proven their worth by combating the Mages Guild and their foul Daedric Magicks which plague Dawn's Beauty, and they will be rendered the respect befitting of such an auspicious organization.

This is your only warning. Any further discussion of the skeletons being anything but the revered resurrected heroes of the Empire, any further mocking of the Fellowship as the 'Worm Cult' or any other slanderous monikers, will result in swift and harsh punishment for defeatism and undermining the morale of the Legion. Furthermore, offenders will be handed over to the Anchorites so they can see firsthand how the Resurrected are truly handled. These offenders will be stripped of rank and serve away from their respective units for an indefinite period of time, to be returned at the discretion of their superiors.

As a final word: we are once again accepting applicants to pledge their bodies and souls to be resurrected upon their death. Those who do so will be granted an increased pay for the duration of their service - both alive and dead - as well as double benefits bequeathed to their dependents.

For the Glory of the Empire.

Respectfully,
Lucius Ossuarios, Primate of Resurrection of the Fellowship of the Anchorites, on behalf of Lord Mannimarco

With the increased losses we are incurring we require more souls and bodies. Monthly quota per cohort has been raised from 48 to 60 bodies. Achieve this by any means necessary. Use the sick and infirm, those awaiting courts-martial or execution; simply hand them over to your division's anchorites and they'll take care of the rest. And if you choose to use slain enemies or burial sites *please for the love of the Aedra* KEEP IT SECRET. We cannot afford further rumors circulating throughout the Legion. Remember, we do this in the name of the Empire; for the security of our sons, daughters, and most importantly, for our homeland and Empire. We trust that you will comply with the raised quota, for those who don't will be...'recycled', as well.
