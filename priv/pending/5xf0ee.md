On an untold year of Jurgen the Calm's hermitage he met with the Assassin of Veloth, a fell and powerful elf. From the East she came, a slave given no name and raised to do evil. She had learned and mastered the art of wielding four blades at once. She was taught by the Blasphemers of Veloth to abhor Jurgen, son of Jurgen, to seek vengeance for the sins of Jurgen, father of Jurgen. For four days she tried to murder The Calm. 

On the first day, which was an evil day, she wove a glamour about herself and slipped into High Hrothgar and ensorcelled an onion with foul intent. She left this onion in its usual place, beside Jurgen's prayer mat. Jurgen, son of Jurgen ate of this onion but did not perish, for he had eaten the onion whole long before she had poisoned it.

On the second day, which was an evil day, she prepared a barbed arrow and shot it at The Calm. This arrow was crafted by the Deep Folk, who knew many secret and forbidden things. This key pierced the side of Jurgen, son of Jurgen, but he did not perish, for he was not among the things that the Deep Folk comprehended (at least before they un-became).

On the third day, which was an evil day, she sabotaged the three-thousand three hundred and thirty third step on Monahaven to expel killing light when The Calm trod upon it. Jurgen, son of Jurgen did indeed tread upon this step, but he did not perish, for The Calm had befriended the mountain and all that was of the mountain could do him no evil.

On the fourth day, which was a holy day, she leapt at her enemy in frustration, all four blades flashing in morning sun. But the daggers of Veloth could not penetrate Jurgen's iron scales. Jurgen flared his wings and a great gust knocked the Assassin of Veloth to the ground. 

"Why!", she screamed, tears freezing on her cheeks. "Why can't I kill you!?"

Thus spoke Jurgen the Calm: "I am Jurgen the Calm and the Way of the Voice is paved with tomorrows. I drank of your killing action and shed that which had died. My analogues are exactly numbered unto my doom."

As the Assassin looked on in wonderment The Calm decided to give her a Name, which was a secret and precious thing. And the Assassin perished in Jurgen's gullet.

Untold ages after the fourth day, the Daughter of Jurgen returned to Vvardenfell and cut three priests of Veloth into the shape of a hidden monastery. And there, she and her aspect line lived in secrecy until the Eating of The World.
