Fear the deep forests, where the air is still and there is no morning.

Fear the palanquin of hares and its dread rider.

Fear the liquid creaking of the branches.

Fear Herma Mora, the Demon of Knowledge, who will pierce your skull and quaff your dreams.

Build a shrine against Him at the edge of the forest, from the bones of the malformed and the skulls of His totem.

Against Herma Mora, leave offerings of ink, parchment, and the brain-water of your foes. Do this in the twilight hours, when He is strongest.

Praise Herma Mora, Testing Father of the Old Wood. You who taught Ysgramor against deception, you whose slow visions tempered us against the fallacies of elfkind.

We fled Monahaven for the Old Wood. We grew and murdered and learned under your fathomless shadow. And from your ancient murk we emerged, stronger and wiser.

Praise and Fear Herma Mora, Kindliest of Demons.
