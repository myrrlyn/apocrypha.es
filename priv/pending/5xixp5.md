An obscure cult in the city state of Alcaire has a peculiar set of beliefs. Most Nordic and Cyrodiilic clergymen find it borderline heretical, but as this cult still acknowledges Talos as the Ninth Divine, they let them continue their worship. This is the first chapter of their holy text, the Tiberada.

*And in those days all provinces of the Empire were dead, for war and poverty and petty conflict made it broken. The Snakes held it in chains, but when the chain broke, the land fell apart. In the lawless centuries, everyone with a hill could become king, not only in Bretony, but in the entire world of Man. The dragonfires were cold and Chim-el Adabal was lost again. In this darkness, a fair maid named Maurrie set out to look for the solution to end the plague of Man. She crossed a bay, a desert and a crag and entered the land of Colovia. It was there when the spirit of Reman appeared before her and said, “I am the king of all men and son of dragons, if you seek a child to make this land anew, find a Hill of Gold and become its queen.”*

*And so did Maurrie journey forth until she found the birthplace of Cyrodiil. There, spirit of Reman appeared again and said unto her, “Your child will be my equal, son of dragons, champion of Man and tamer of Mer. You shall return to your homeland with him and name him Tiber, for it is a name from my people.” And so did Reman love unto the Breton maid.*

*Maurrie returned to Alcaire, the land of her forefathers and married a simple carpenter. Hjolfr Early-Beard was his name and he was a son of Skyrim. He did not want to marry an adulterer, but a dragon visited him in his dream and told him, “her son is the king of kings, a hero of Nords and all Men, take her as wife and raise the child as your own, such is the will of Dragon and Fox”. And so did Hjolfr take Maurrie as wife, even if she was with child. When she gave birth, he named the child Hjalti and raised him as his own, even if he was a Manmer.*

*The child grew up, to become a Nordic general by the name of Hjalti Early-Beard and joined king Cuhlecain, the one who healed the borders of Colovia and so was worthy. Hjalti fought the heathen Reachmen with art his foster father told him stories about. And Greybeards on the mountain heard his voice, how they heard his father in the ages past, and summoned him as Dragonborn, for his blood is of Alessia and Reman. Then, he found Chim-el Adabal on the birthplace of his father. After that, he captured the city of white gold for his king Cuhlecain, but a heathen Reachman struck him down during a celebration. Hjalti was alone to take the throne, and so he did, and named himself Tiber, as his mother told him.*

 This text could be an attempt to make Imperial Cult more Breto-centric. But it wouldn't get much traction. This is just a little parody of both Remanada and the New Testament.
