What is with the Orrery? It is essentially a map of Mundus, right? Nirn in the center, the two moons Masser and Secunda, and ....other planets. Specifically one for each of the 8 central gods in the Imperial Pantheon.

Now in the Alessian era, before the pact between Akatosh and Alessia that led to the amulet of kings, I was under the understanding that the gods quite literally walked on Nirn, with Akatosh literally, physically being beside Alessia on her Deathbed, and lighting the dragonfires for the first time himself. Presumably these were the gods, these physical beings on Nirn that were Et'ada, retaining their power while the Ehlnofey faded and gave birth to the mortal races of Nirn before dying. Now when the Amulet of Kings was made and the covenant was founded, neither the gods nor the daedra were allowed to walk on Nirn anymore, even though the daedra still manage to worm their influence in through small unstable portals, idols and mortal worship.

So back to the question of the Orrery. What are those planets that surround Nirn, Masser and Secunda? Are they just symbolic? Are they the actual embodiments of the Aedra that ascended from Nirn after the Amulet of Kings was made? If so, why are only the gods from the Imperial Pantheon represented? Why do some of them orbit others, and why are Kynareth and Zenithar so far apart if they are supposed to be connected?

I'm just going to presume that the universe doesn't work quite the way it does in our universe, because the stars aren't balls of gas, but instead holes to Aetherius created by Magnus and the Magna-Ge. This would obviously mean that Nirn is the center of Mundus, much like the Orrery depicts, but we never see those other planets. We never hear them referenced by anyone looking at the night sky or any scholars, except Boethial herself who vaguely mentions celestial alignments having an effect on the Shade of the Revenant, an important event for Necromancers.

Maybe it has more to do with the way the Dwemer looked at the gods, or the political implication and religious symbolism of the Orrery that was clearly a gift to the Empire of Man.
