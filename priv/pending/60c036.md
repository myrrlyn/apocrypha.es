A Velothiid interviews one of the Lastborn

**Q: Why are you the Lastborn?**

*A: Because Mother is Dead and there is no Morning*

**Q: What Gods do you worship?**

*A: There are no Gods, only Echoes in the Dark. We hold four to be sacred, but we pray to none.*

**Q: Which four do you consider sacred?**

*A: Xrib, Ori, [WALK-BRASS-GOD], and Mother*

**Q: Do you consider anything else sacred?**

*A: The Endless Sky, the Yawning Deep, Tonal Songs, Ancient Silence, Drumming in the Dark, [SNOW-THROAT].*

**Q: Why are these sacred?**

*A: Because they became us and we became them.*

**Q: What do you think of the Daedra?**

*A: Demons, Allies, Enemies, Food.*

**Q: What do you think of the Velothiid?**

*A: That you are not us.*

**Q: What do you think of Vivec?**

*A: That It is more than you and apart from us.*

**Q: What do you think of Molag Bal?**

*A: That It has nothing left to offer us.*

**Q: What do you think of the Dwemer?**

*A: Dead Conductors.*

**Q: Who were you before?**

*A: Sinners, Slaves, Blind, Falmer.*

**Q: Who are you now?**

*A: Lastborn Children of the Sky and the Depths.*

**Q: Why did you change?**

*A: Because Mother is Dead and there is no Morning.*
