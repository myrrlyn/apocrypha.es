I had a dream about Voryn.

I was looking in the mirror, and my reflection was his likeness, and holding a red lantern.  I touched the mirror and it shattered, and Voryn stood in the room.  The broken glass became the 
Silver Man from that terrible dream from so long ago, covered in hoarfrost, bearded and angry.

“Don't you see where you really are? Don't you know who Shor really is? Don't you know what this war is?” he shouted at us, as if we were meant to understand.

Then the Silver Man was gone.

Voryn said, “The Heart”

I woke up gasping for air, panicked.  Alandro reached out to comfort me, and I almost wept with relief.
