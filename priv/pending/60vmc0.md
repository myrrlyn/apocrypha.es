The Nords have been spotted by the Velothi tribes to the Northwest, and their scouts report that Voryn is with them.  I do not know what this means, but I have no choice but to trust in my dear friend.

The Great Houses have mustered their armies, and the tribes have sent their finest warriors to serve.  All is ready.

There are rumours of Orcs on the move, and even the Khajiit traders have all seemed to retreat and gather together on their own.  I am unsure of whose side they are on.  I am unsure as to whose side anyone is on.

I must now give Dumac one final chance to end this, to preserve the peace we have worked our entire lives for.  I know not what foul magic Kagrenac has wrought on my dear friend, but if I must strike him down, I will do so with a heavy heart.
