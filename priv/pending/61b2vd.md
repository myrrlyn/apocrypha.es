The body has been laid to rest
The scars of last battle evident to naked eye
Awoken from dream, to another
Of battle and glory eternal

Land of nords past, and home of nords future
The eye concedes beauty through the lens of death
The awoken nords feast and gleam like dew fresh fallen
Before the bridge of bone they stand in awe.

Mighty Tsun, Lord of tests, lover of battle, test my skill in death, and may it be the same as in life.
Valor eternal, battle of ages, I will contend with a god, to ensure my place in glory 

Ysgramor, Olaf, Stormcloak, my eyes strain as they show in brilliant light.
 My idols have become my companions. 
They tell stories of the shaping of our legends.

Mighty Shor, lend me your ear, as I weave my story of death, glory, conquest, and power. 
Protect the ones I left behind, as they now have been stripped of their protector.

They know I am happy here.
That nothing can damage me
For I am Animus incarnate
And I am in the presence of Gods
