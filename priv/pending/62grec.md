We invoked the First Council, in the hope of averting war.

Voryn returned and speaks for the Nords.  But this was not the strangest thing to happen.

Amid the clamour of distrust and hate, entered the Princes of Misrule.  All sixteen, in merish form standing around me in a circle.

I thought I was to die.

“Not yet, Hortator” replied Azura, who knelt first, “For sake of us all, we name you Royalty.”

The other Princes knelt, and the Ehlnofex came to me unbidden:

CHIM.  

And I was changed.

A horrified gasp broke the silence.  I saw from my new place (that was not really a place, since I had not moved an inch), that it was my family, their jealousy piercing through this sacred moment.
