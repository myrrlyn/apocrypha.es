*This text was found in the raided sanctuary of the Order of the Black Worm. It was placed on an altar that was stained in dark blood. It was made of a whole piece of obsidian and the top of the chamber was open to reveal the Necromancer's Room. Black soul gems were scattered all about the altar.*

I have escaped the bounds of mortality, broken the sarcophagus of flesh I was born into. Through this fetid apotheosis twice over, I have learned many truths of this world that would be hidden from the eyes of those incapable of the sight of ALL. Here now are the truths of the God of Worms, the Dictates of the Plagued

1. All we know is dead. Mundus is a graveyard of divine limbs. Thus, necromancy is the highest art for with it one can regain the power of the Dead Lords. 

2. Dreams are *death*. Those who dream touch the Leech, the Cleaner of Souls, and thus are dead. This extends to the Higher things, the lattice that no mortal can comprehend. We are *NOT* in a dream. We are the remnants of death, the fevered thoughts of afterlife of something greater than WE. 

3. All patterns repeat into the end of time. The words repeat, written into the very skin of the Aurbis: King, Rebel, Observer. It is constant. Obsessive. Unending. Sacrifice is the word sketched above this. Murder of the Higher. Murder of the Maker. Murder of the Eight who are Nine. Murder of the Elves for the White-Gold. Recreating these patterns invoke all of reality itself.

4. The Deniers, the Daedra, are witnesses to this all and take advantage. They provide the only constant: change. They do no cling to the illusion of permanency, the delusion that life can provide. They embrace the state of nothing and so they become permanent by way of paradox. 

5. Power is the only virtue. Strength, the only admirable quality. Seek out power. Steal all you can. Strip the Bones of the Earth, swear false Oaths to the Gods of Oblivion, Whisper into the sleeping ears. Then you will know

It is through these five Dictates that we may ascend the Lattice, the Gradient of ALL. But above all, this is the true path to that beyond the restrictive state of GOD. Those who walk the false path of LOVE are fools, unable to use the power given them. What good has the God of Man wrought in the world since he left the Ruby Throne? No, it is not WE, not US. It is *I*. It will only be *I*. The Sharmat was close. But *I* am closer.

LOVE is dead.

LOVE is false.

There is only one path to power.

It is the Path of Hunger and the first letter is *I*

And no dream will limit me.
