*Taken from Ursok gro-Kagrush's "A Pocket Guide to Orsinium" handbook, although the original author of the following text is unknown. It was first found as a note near the outskirts of Dragonstar in the orcish refugee communities formed after the Sacking of Nova Orsinium.*

During my travels in Hammerfell and Skyrim I have seen tribes formed by orc refugees who escaped from the foul Orsinium attack years ago. I was a survivor of that devastating assault too, but the tribal orcs didn't see me as one of them, because of my very belief on their religion.


"This is what we get for defying Mauloch, being at the very edge of death." Many chieftains spoke. Me? I call those words nothing more than gibberish.


Stronghold orcs see our belief of Trinimac as heresy, many of our brethren call us "the scapegoats of Ashpit." But they seem to forget that "Trinimac" first started by Gortwog gro-Nagorm as an ideology, not a religion.


According to his belief God-King Mauloch had cursed our race with exclusion and loneliness, that if we continued to follow Malacath's code we could never build ourselves a great nation. A province for us to call home. Malacath's sphere is "protector of the outcasts" but I ask you: for how long will we play the role of the outcast? We can't be aliens to the world forever. We have to be a part of the community and drop the idea of casting ourselves to secluded mountains. Orcs are not weak. We are not outcasts. We are not going to play the role of forlorn anymore. We are not some random dungeon-swarming creatures or common mercenaries or bandits. 


This is the difference between Orsinium Orcs and Stronghold Orcs. We have a sense of unity. We have an ambition to recognition. We have a deep passion to form a home. No matter how many Shinjis the world throw at us, no matter how many times Orsinium falls to the ground we will make it acknowledge us. We will take the last remaining stone and start rebuilding it again as our will is as sharp as Trinimac's heart-ripping gauntlet. Orsinium and its idea will grow, be it with politics or war.


I heard talks about those who carry the same belief with me has reunited in the Hammerfell and Skyrim border. They plan to rebuild Orsinium again within the Dragontail Mountains. I will take my leave tomorrow to see if the rumors are actually true. If you are a proud son or daughter of Trinimac, then I suggest you move there too.


*The call of valor awaits!*
