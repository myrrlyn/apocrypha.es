*(The following is the most common version of a traditional Khajiiti song dating back to the Second Empire, frequently sung in Anequinian caravanserais. I took the liberty of producing the literal translation from original Ta'agra.)*

    From Cyrod came Shizzar the Red,
    His cloak drenched in elven blood.
    From Cyrod he commanded his legions
    To Anequinian sands.

    We fought them bravely, but
    Our claws were blunted on their armors.
    Rivers of sugar flowed bountifully
    On Anequinian sands.

    But Alkosh said “Do not despair.
    Follow in my shadow and we will win
    And chase the enemies out
    Of Anequinian sands.”

    And Alkosh said “Be fleet of foot.
    When they swing at you, jump aside.
    Follow hidden paths and lose them
    In Anequinian sands.”

    And Shizzar said “Curse the beasts!
    When we swing at them, they jump aside.
    We're chasing our own tails
    In Anequinian sands.”

    And Alkosh said “Burn their wagons.
    Lead them to waterless wastes.
    Who but a Khajiit can drink
    From Anequinian sands?”

    And Shizzar said “They burned our wagons.
    We’re lost in waterless wastes.
    We must retreat or else we die
    On Anequinian sands.”

    And Alkosh said “The moons have risen!
    Strike with blade and claw and tusk.
    Unleash your thunder to show we're warriors
    Of Anequinian sands!”

    He pounced on them and we followed.
    The Tojay weighted their shields with javelins.
    The Ohmes danced with clashing swords
    On Anequinian sands.

    The Suthay riders on Senche mounts
    Drove a wedge through enemy ranks.
    The Dagi shot them with poisoned darts
    On Anequinian sands.

    The Cathay dealt them mighty blows.
    The Pahmar rent their flesh from bone.
    The Alfiq burned them with magic bolts
    On Anequinian sands.

    Shizzar brought ten thousand men,
    But he fled back home alone.
    The bones of the rest are scattered
    On Anequinian sands.
