I AM AND ALL ARE ME

Behind us is memory, armed with knowledge and pushing with many arms.

We dominate the walk, the path made of fire and stone.

The destination calls to us with a panoply of dreams.

Above everything is the first House where I was born.

Within it is my empty heart that beats my Poison Song.

I Am The Guiding Allegiance

I put a star into the world's mouth to murder it.

I stole the voice from the sky to control it.

HATE IS PEACE
