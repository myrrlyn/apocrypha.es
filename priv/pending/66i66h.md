WHO AM I?

I am everybody.

I am a brother.

I am a sister.

I am a father.

I am a mother.

I am not a lover but the loved.

When you see me you see yourself.

WHO AM I?

I am nobody.

I am a n'wah.

I am a s'wit.

I am scum

I eat ash and drink milk.

I am the ripping motion and the empty whole.

When you see me you see everybody else.

You ask yourself if I am a god?

The answer is I am the question.
