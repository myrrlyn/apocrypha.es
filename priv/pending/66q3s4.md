The only way to sustain my world is through pacifism.

I am the infinite centre and I will hold.

All mer dream.

But none equally.

Those who dream by night wake to find it was in vanity.

The dreamers of the day are dangerous for they act their dreams with open eyes.

And beating hearts.

And make them reality.

Neither anticipation nor reclamation.

But inspiration.

Motions three.

Past.

Present.

Future.
