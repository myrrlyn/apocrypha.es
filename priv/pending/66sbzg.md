(The Great War and Stormcloak Rebellion from the perspective of a Nord civilian)      
*All months and days have been made up and assigned to events for the purpose of creative expression. Some dates may have hidden significance.*    

4E 173, 16th of Rain’s Hand    
	When you get to be an old man, you start to think about how people remember you. I haven’t fought any battles, or accomplished great feats, but I’ve been here a while, and I’ve seen much. So I figured, why not let that be my story.    
I was born on the eve of the Great Collapse, in 4E 122. That’s why they call me steady foot. All of Skyrim was a-shakin’ and rockin’, but me, no I never cried. Quiet as a rock. Can’t say I stayed that way though. Aye, much time has passed since then, and I have been witness to many things in mine 79 years here in Tamriel. These days it seems like you can’t walk across a hold without somebody either trying to stab you or recruit you, but then again, maybe it’s always been like that. Hard to think of a time when we Nords haven’t been up in arms about something. I want to say it’s the youth these days, but I know how I was when I was young.     
We lived in the Reach, but my pa got recruited by the Legion and ended up in Cyrodiil. I guess that’s where the Emperor lives. He got killed in a bandit raid on Bruma, at least that’s what they tell us. He liked the soldier’s life, could never figure out why though. Seems like a real pain, marching around and obeying orders all day.     
	When the elves attacked Cyrodiil in 4E 171, I was nearly 50. I know because my ma taught me to read and write. Said it was important if I didn’t want to end up like my father. She was right too, look where I am now.     

174, 13th of Rain’s Hand     
	The damn elves took the Imperial City they say. Don’t know what’s going to happen now. Is the empire going to be destroyed? There’s rumors that the emperor is dead.     

174, 3rd of Evening Star     
A whole lot of boys joined up with the legion to fight the elves with Jonna when the Emperor Titus Mede II came past Skyrim after the Imperial City was lost, but not me. Of course, this meant when the Reachmen rose up to take Markarth, we were short on men. The old ram’s-head who lived down the road from me with the big mouth got himself killed, but I knew there was no point in causing trouble for myself, so I kept quiet.      

175, 5th of Midyear     
	So the Emperor with all his troops marched down to Cyrodiil to meet Naarifin, the Thalmor general who controlled the Imperial City, and they actually beat him! They’re calling it The Battle of the Red Ring. Of course, the Legion didn’t fare too well either. Of all the young lads I knew, only one survived, Rognar. He came back home after that battle. Well, most of him, and a wooden leg.      

175, 24th of Midyear     
After all this, the Emperor must have decided that he didn’t wanna fight the elves anymore, so him and some of those tall needle-ears met in the tower, the one in the imperial city, and wrote up some terms of peace. Turns out, one of those terms meant we couldn’t worship Talos anymore. Nobody liked it, but Rognar wouldn’t talk about it. The boy just sits in the Old Hroldan inn and drinks all day, muttering about how many men they lost. The people are angry, and most of them are still worshipping Talos. Now the legion is back in Skyrim, but they’re not causing any trouble for us. Maybe we’ll be allowed to Worship Talos after all?     

175, 5th of Frostfall     
We’re hearing that the emperor has removed Hammerfell from the empire after they fought the treaty, and now they’re fighting the elves themselves. Is that what would happen if Skyrim opposed the concordat?     

176, 20th of Hearthfire     
	Young Jarl Igmund finally got someone to help take back Markarth, an ex-legion soldier and the son of the Jarl of Windhelm, Ulfric Stormcloak. Here is a fiery one.      

176, 1st of Frostfall     
I’ve heard that Ulfric used the Thu’um to free Markarth, the voice of the dragons! I thought it was only the graybeards way up on their mountain that did that, but they say Ulfric learned it from them. When he took back the city from the Reachmen, he supposedly executed everyone in his way. I don’t put too much stock in rumors, but with such a weapon, maybe there is some truth to it?     

176, 7th of Frostfall     
	Ulfric wouldn’t give the city back to Igmund until he promised to allow free Talos worship, so Igmund agreed.     

176, 14th of Frostfall     
	With  the Reachmen out of the way, the Legion can enter the reach again, and they brought the Thalmor with them. The Thalmor are the agents of the Aldmeri Dominion. Supposedy that’s what the elves call themselves now. Hrmph. They’re here to make sure we follow the terms of the agreement, but I don’t remember agreeing to anything. Rognar says he doesn’t care about the gods anymore, I think battle shook him too much. He’s still so young. With the Thalmor here, the jarl had to start arresting people for worshipping Talos openly, or lose his throne. A jarl is supposed to protect his people, but I don’t know a man who would lose all that just to save some angry protesters (the loud ones, I kept my Talos shrine hidden like a smart man).     

176, 24th of Frostfall     
	So now Igmund, with Imperial soldiers at his heels and the Thalmor dogs holding his rope, has been rooting out the Talos worshippers in Markarth. It’s easier to keep secrets when you don’t live in the city. Turns out, Ulfric kept up his Talos worship and protested (can’t say I’m surprised), and got himself thrown in jail. The Jarl, his father, died though, so Ulfric got released and made Jarl of Windhelm. I knew we would hear more from him.     

176, 30th of Frostfall     
	On top of everything else! High King Istlod has died. The Moot will meet to decide a new king, but there is no question who it will be. He may be young, but Istlod’s son Torygg will be king.     
It’s the Emperor’s Birthday (Uriel Septim UII). Nobody feels like celebrating.     

177, 2nd of Sun’s Dawn     
	Some of the Reachmen who escaped the retaking of Markarth formed some new camps, they’re calling themselves the Forsworn. Been raiding settlements lately. Rumor has it they’ve even boarded up with some hagravens. They must be absolutely mad.     

178, 10th of Sun’s Height     
	They found my shrine! Those bastard Thalmor destroyed it! I should have hidden it further from my house. Hopefully it won’t lead them to me.     

180, 10th of Second Seed     
	Hammerfell has reached an uneasy peace with the elves at last. The redguards still don’t like the empire. Many Nords feel the same.     


4E 200, 16th of Midyear     
	It’s the Mid Year Celebration festival. I am now 78 years of age. Ulfric Stormcloak is Jarl of Windhelm, and has grown into the position. I fear he may have more growing yet to do. That man was born for a fight, and he is ambitious. Keeps going on and on about how Skyrim needs to do what Hammerfell did, and cede from the Empire. A new Legion General has been sent to Solitude, and been tasked with keeping the peace here in Skyrim, but he doesn’t seem to be much of a diplomat. I’ve heard talk that he is highly respected in Cyrodiil for his military prowess.     

4E 201, 9th of First Seed     
	By the Nine! Ulfric Stormcloak had an audience with the High King, but when he arrived, he challenged him to combat, and slaughtered him! Our traditions hold that the High King is honor bound to accept all challenges, but Torygg was only a boy. I knew Ulfric was restless under Thalmor oppression, but to go after Torygg himself? What does it accomplish? The lad was just Tullius’s puppet.      

201, 10th of First Seed     
	They’re saying that Ulfric used the Thu’um against Torygg. How is that a fair fight? What is he trying to prove? Moreover, Ulfric has begun mobilizing men out by Windhelm, and it response, Tullius is scrambling to secure the borders of all the holds.     

201, 13th of First Seed     
	The fighting began today.     

201, 17th of First Seed     
	Rognar drinks even more now. I don’t know where he gets the gold, he hasn’t worked in ages. Keeps going on and on about how Ulfric is a fool and a traitor to the Legion. I know Ulfric served the Empire, but a traitor? Probably just the ramblings of a drunkard.     

201, 20th of Sun’s Height     
	Half the men in the surrounding villages have left to join Ulfric, while the rest say that we need to remain as part the Empire. Rognar is among them. He is no longer the youth he used to be. The war against the elves broke something in him. He says that Ulfric’s anger is misdirected at the empire. I think he’s right. This may be my last entry. I feel my bones aching for the ground, and I don’t have the strength to resist the call.
