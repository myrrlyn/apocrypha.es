*Titus Armenius, Imperial Historical Society, 4E197*

*This particular piece was found next to a pile of ash after the attack on the Chapel of Dibella in Anvil in 3E 433. I will do my best to transcribe it, although some of it is illegible.*

Oh Fair Lady, hear my call,
You beckon me to [illegible] and stand in your loving embrace.
Teach me O' spirit of passion, 
That my fire is never doused,
My passion never quenched.
I lay my eyes upon your breasts
Their holy light washes over me.
I am not worthy.
Grant us [illegible] divine will,
Let us perform your arts,
That it would please you.
Passion Dancer, your swaying soothes me
[illegible]
May we receive your blessed moans,
That we might bestow your mark.
Blessings to all that Follow the Lady.

*Gaian Merinus*
