False gods claim immolation is the way to salvation.

Their flock burn themselves at their touch.

But I am an Empire of Smoke.

Breathe me in.

Welcome to the House of Me.

I have a thousand faces and a million names.

Seducer.

Destroyer.

Advisor.

Saviour.

Creator.

God.

Sharmat.

Truth.

My ends justify my means.

I am the hunger in all things.

And the whole world is in my heart.
