[Part I: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/678o45/c0dex_of_the_divine_anumidium_part_i_of_iv/ ]

**Sermon Zero-the-Second**

So the Child emerged from the Womb, shining in the golden skin of hir birthing, orbited by the plane(t)s and tones of hir father’s song.  Ze beheld the Velothi hordes – a mongrel, murdering race, lusting for violence – and gave voice to hir music.  The Velothi cowered in despair before hir illumination, for hir Heart was a Star and ze shown with the light and the way of Salvation.

But the Tribunal rose as one, revealing their own Way of Walking.  The Liar-of-Magic took from hir all mystery, rendering hir Known and Knowable.  The Liar-of-Strength ripped from hir the Star, imprisoning hir within a Confined and Confining Understanding.  Lastly, the Liar-of-Words took from hir all Progeneration, for he saw hir father’s mockery, and obliterated it by the Manner of Truth, which is to say:  a great hammering.

In this way did the Tribunal blaspheme the Hope of the Dwemer, making of it a stasis beyond Possibility, a prison of suffering.  They did this to deny its revelation and that is why they betrayed the Slave of Azura, taking upon themselves the mantle of gods.  For they could not accept the truth of the Walking Star and comforted themselves in their own self-magnificence.

The ending of the words is Silence.
