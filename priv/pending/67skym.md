**Mor V’arla Va Ky’naless Esha**

*This is an account from the early First Era of how Minotaurs came to be. It was written by a Kothringi bard with a heretical streak who was under the Alessian Order. The author seems to have written it in response to the harsh treatment of Minotaurs under the Alessian Order*

[Fragment Lost] ...and then, after she had proclaimed herself Cyrod to the doubtless assortment of rebel men and mer alike, it was so that Paravant, the first at a great many things, did [Untranslatable] herself to the halls of White-Gold, which echoed with the chants of liberty, a strange yet tangible new sensation that had been repressed in the hearts of Men since time immemorial. 

Paravant, variously known as Esha, had sent word for Mor, Breath-of-Kyne, whom she often sought out for counsel in times of uncertainty. Mor strode into her presence on all four of his mighty hooves, which clattered upon the stone-floor with bluntness akin to that of a wine-knife. His eagerness to meet with her was easily displayed by the constant stirring of his tail, which dragged behind him in  humble manner, as all tails should. 

Esha turned to address him, and met his eyes with a gaze befitting that of a Mother. Mor grew large beneath himself at this forward display of affection, as he could no longer hide his lust for Cyrod. Esha took immediate notice of his protrusion (it was too large not to) but before [Fragment Lost] Mor stopped her and spoke thusly, “This new [kingdom?] you have forged shall have need of divine protectors, mighty warriors loyal only to you and your Word. I wish to seed the very earth, if you’ll allow me, to raise up these soldiers for Nu-Cyrod.”

Without hesitation or a spoken word (an empress had no need for such things) Esha turned her back to Mor, and in one swift motion that would make a hoplite proud, let her robes strike the earth. She leaned forward, exposing her considerably large flesh to the man-bull, and formally requested that he ride her, just as she had ridden him many times before. Mor swiftly obliged, as he was under sworn oath to obey his Empress. 

And it was so that Mor entered into the earth, with this new sensation of liberty washing over him abruptly and without warning. For Esha had created liberty  from nothing, and she had not freed just mind and heart, but flesh as well, so that Men could join themselves together as they pleased without fear of judgement or retribution, which were thoughts fostered in the Old Ways and had no place in Nu-Cyrod.

This new sensation quickly overwhelmed him, and he cried out in passion to his mother. Kyne looked down upon this union of earth and bull and cried with tears of joy, tears that would ensure the crops of this new [kingdom?] would be bountiful for many years to come. 

Mor’s cry went out over the endless jungles of Cyrod and echoed in the heart of every tiger, whether near or far. The tigers were quickly stricken by bull-fear, and fled south, taking the jungle with them in their haste. *(This is a curious passage, as it seems to imply that Cyrod was once a jungle inhabited by tigers. Similar proclamations have been made by other First Era authors such as Heimskr, and the details have been fairly consistent. I suggest that these are simply mistranslations of early Nede languages that we have wrongfully interpreted. In any case it requires further study.)*

Mor had been vigorously thrusting himself into the earth for many hours when he finally breathed his essence onto the world, seeding it with life. In this singular moment of ecstasy, Mor found himself spread across time, and he realized that he was not the only one to enter her in such a manner. Esha would be a Mother and a Lover to many, most of whom would also wear the mantle of Cyrod. 

She was Cyrod, Mother of Cyrod. 

After they had finished, the Daughters of Mor (hunter-priestess and attendants of Mor) who were stripped to nothing but freed flesh, came into the room and collected the man-bulls essence in their hands. They then congregated and spread his essence into each other with quick and deft hands, in a flurry of pleasure and duty. 

This is how the Minotaurs, staunch and loyal defenders of the Empire, were born. Never doubt this, no matter what the [Untranslatable] monkey may tell you.
