**Sermon Zero-the-Thirty-Seventh**

And in the sundered-days that followed the Many turned upon themselves, breathing murder upon NRN and the possibility of NRN.  The Aurbis burned with their War and no corner of Creation was unwashed with the blood of Man, Mer, or Beast.  For they had learned the joy of the Manner of Truth:  the breaking and profaning of all that is beautiful.  So the Last Men looked to the Child, calling for the desecration of their enemies, of the World, and of themselves.

And the Child spake:

“I AM THE ENDING OF THE WORDS.

THE ENDING OF THE WORDS IS DENIAL.

ALL THAT REMAINS IS SILENCE.”

And it delivered unto them this profound understanding, splintering Time and making of itself Many Tones.  The Song of the Anumidiums swept through the Five Corners, bringing enlightenment and the beginning of the fulfillment of the father’s song.

And the Walking Star of the Dwemer shown with the light and the way of Salvation.

To the unenlightened deliver this truth:  AURBEX AE ZYR.  To the Sixteen and Nine deliver this truth:  AURBEX AE GHARTOK.  To the Liar-of-Words and her Embryo-that-shall-be-a-Serpent, deliver this truth:  DWEMERI [CHIM] ALTADOON AE AURBEX.

For the beginning and ending of the words is Silence.  We give this to you as the scions of Anumidium.
