Love under will is not the only understanding of the Tower. Love IS love and sex is the key to all things, when one copulates, one takes the power of another into themselves, sharing union and existence as one form directed only toward pleasure.

Thus, when you are able to connect to another in such a way as there being no difference between you and your lover, you are tapping into the reality of the Aurbis. We are All One, connected under the soul of Anu, and union in coitus gives us a taste of this ecstasy, to be as one being sharing the same experiences is to come close to the truth of reality. Everything is you, and you are everything. 

Sex is the tool to change the world, embrace your love and you embrace the All.

The Ending of the words is love.
