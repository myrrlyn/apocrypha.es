# The Moons Collide: Intimacy Among The Khajiit

With the formation of the Dominion there has been an effort to better undestand Khajiiti culture. Considerable amount of studies has been dedicated to the way they wage war, yet none have attempted to discover the way they make love. This is a glaring omission in our understanding of the Khajiit, one that this article strives to rectify. For what is all the war knowledge worth if our aim is to live together peacefully?

# Introduction

The presently known land of Elsweyr is in fact a union of two lands, Anequina and Pelletine, with vastly different climates and cultures. In the south lie marshes dotted with villages and cities, where most of the Khajiiti population resides. In the north lie deserts that are inhabited mostly by nomadic tribes.

What makes Khajiit so peculiar and interesting is that they are the only known race of many shapes. There are 16 "breeds" with vastly different physique, and the breed of the newborn is determined by the phases of moons at the time of its birth (see Appendix 1 for a chart of the breeds and the corresponding moon phases). What's more, all of the breeds can freely interbreed with each other, so its not uncommon for Khajiit of two different breeds to sire a child of a third breed.

A significant amount of lore is therefore dedicated to compensating for the vast differences in physique. This led to development of a large number of mating positions ranging from versatile to extremely niche, which are typically expressed through phases of moons. The physically larger one in a couple is likened to Jode (the Khajiiti name for Masser), while the smaller one is likened to Jone (Secunda).

# Mating positions

**Jone-on-Jode or Mane**

Easy to execute and fitting every breed combination, it is the first way that clan mothers teach the young.

Jode lies on the back, while Jone lies on top of Jode facing it and so that their bellies would touch. Jone puts its weight on the ground unless the size difference is so extreme to make that impractical. This is in esscence a variation of the Altmer way known as Emissary, with roles dictated by size rather than gender.

Sometimes jokingly referred to as "bellyrubs", this is the most basic yet the most versatile way of all. The name "Mane" comes from the phase of Masser and Secunda under which the Mane is said to be born, with Secunda passing afore Masser. This is likened to what the couple is supposed to look like from above.

For Khajiit this way has one more peculiar property: given a large enough difference in size and weight (e.g. Senche-Raht and Dagi) it can be used not only on land but also in the water, assuming Jode provides enough flotation to support the couple. This can be quite a boon during hot weather, which is far from uncommon in their land.

**Arched Jode, Waning Jode, Alfiq, or Pahmar**

Pretty much the inverse of "Mane": Jone lies on the back, facing Jode arched above it, with their hips touching and muzzles aligned.

This way lets the couple compensate for the difference in sizes and mostly equialize their body lenghts, which allows for kissing, licking and tender biting throughout the experience. On the flip side, this way is less foolproof than Jone-on-Jode, particularly in case of male Jode, as care has to be taken not to harm the Jone by being overly eager.

As with the "Mane", the name comes from the moon phases. Pahmar is how this way is supposed to look from above, and Alfiq from the side.

A variant of this way with Jone lying on the belly is referred to as "Senche" or simply "feral".

**Two Crescents**

Can also be called Cathay-Raht (Waxing Moons) in case of male Jone, or Dagi-Raht (Waning Moons) in case of male Jode.

Both Jone and Jode lie on their side, with hind legs at an oblique angle, so that from above the bodies look like two crescents. Unlike the previous ways that dicated positions based on sizes, this way the female is always the "inner" crescent, regardless of size.

This position is suitable for most couples, barring only the most extreme differences in size.

**Others**

As there can be 256 breed combinations in a mated couple, and each combination having its own unique opportunties, the amount of ways to make love they employ is far too large to list here. In addition, the differences in size, the presence of tails and the natural agility of the Khajiit provides them with opportunities mer lack. For example, two Dagi can hang on to a branch with their tails and embrace with all of their other limbs. Motion in this case is achieved by swinging. A Senche-Raht can hold its partner of mosts breeds up in the air using only its tail. And most bizarrely, a Senche can applease his Alfiq lover with one of his fangs, which is sometimes practiced to avoid pregnancy.

# Just-for-fun activities

As the reader is probably aware, Khajiiti manhood is covered in small barbs, which are said to be very pleasurable during "proper" use but limit the opportunities for non-procreational activities. These are thus limited to intimate grooming and tongue-arts, at which the beastly breeds such as Alfiq-raht, Pahmar and Senche are said to be particularly adept.

Due to differences in body length being commonplace, a Khajiit couple often cannot practice tongue-arts on each other simultaneously. However, they have found that it is easily remedied by inviting more Khajiit to participate, which made practice of tongue-arts a group activity. It also serves as a form of bonding, especialy within nomadic tribes of the north.

The combination of group activities and the 16 breeds provides dwellers of large settlements with unimaginable variety. Even in a threesome the amount of variety is staggering. If a Khajiit participates in such an event every week, it will be 10 years before they encounter the same combination of breeds and sexes in their two partners.
