Hello everyone.  I've had this question cross my mind every now and then while looking at the lore, and I felt it was time to ask and share my thoughts on this matter.  Could there be a connection somewhere between the Psijic Order, the Bretons, the Bosmer, and the Centaur?

Now first off, I know that the Centaur haven't really been touched on in previous games aside from Daggerfall, but they still exist in the lore (and looking at Legends, which goes into depth the tales and encounters of Cicero as he made his way to Skyrim's remaining Sanctuaries through the player/mysterious Brother/Sister there is even a card showing off the Centaur) and are found primarily in two areas.  These two provinces they are commonly found in are Valenwood and High Rock.  However, we know very little about the Centaur aside from this and one other fact, which I will get into later.  Other than this, we have no idea how they came to be in Tamriel, what gods they worship, how they view the various races of Man, Mer, and Beastfolk, etc - [just they they appear to be a sort of beastfolk with Man-like(races of Man) features and Merish ears](http://images.uesp.net//8/83/LG-cardart-Elder_Centaur.png) going by art from the Elder Scrolls Legends.  

Already this is sounding like nonsense, I bet - but hear me out.  Now, what do we know about the Psijics?  The Psijics practice the "Old Ways" - Mysticism.  And as the book "On Artaeum" suggest, these Old Ways focus on manipulation of nature itself.  Not the use of magicka, but nature - all with very similar effects.

And what of the Bretons?  And the Bosmer?  What do they have to do with this?  Well, aside from the Aldmer as ancestors, what do these two have in common?  They both worship, in different capacities mind you, Y'ffre (or Jephre to the civilized Bretonic citizens of High Rock) - God of the Song and Forest, the first Earth Bone, the first of the et'Ada to sacrifice themselves to give rise to the rules of nature and life on Nirn.

I mentioned there was another thing, one final fact, we know about the Centaur.  I might as well share it now.  According to the Psijic Order (as stated in the Daggerfall manual), the Centaur are "true followers of the Old Ways".  These Beastfolk of unknown origins are "true followers" of the Old Ways - of Mysticism - which may very well involve the manipulation of nature.  Nature being the domain of the first Ehlnofey, Y'ffre, who is worshipped by not just the Altmer, but (to a far greater degree) the Bosmer as well as (to a different degree and primarily by the various Wyrds or those who are in proximity to them in High Rock) the Bretons.  The Psijics, also, have shown they possess more than just purely Altmeri members in their Order - as shown in Skyrim with the Bosmer Gelebros.  

Could the Psijics be willing to share their teachings with those who follow Y'ffre/Jephre - with Bretons or Bosmer who seek to learn from these powerful Monks of Artaeum?  Could there be a connection with the Bosmer, the Bretons, and the Centaur?  Has following the Old Way resulted, somehow, in the birth of the Centaur?  Just how strong of a connection is there between a Psijic and the forces of nature if the Centaur - mannish, merish, bestial beings - are considered by them to be "true followers" if there is a connection between Y'ffre/Jephre and the Old Ways/Mysticism?

All these questions and more come to my mind... but I would like to hear your thoughts, your two Septims on this theory.
