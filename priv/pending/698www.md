*From ancient song severed,
birthed in splendour with harmony divine,
Old Mora, devil of Secrets-Yet-To-Be-Told,
Grasped with Demonic fervour, 
the Vault of Aurbis.*

*Simulacra of Kyne’s Breath, 
Nord-foe and slighted jest,
Protean, Y’ffre’s Bones their succour,
Wet air embraced their shifting orchestra.
The Tones, The Art of high majesty,
seized, sprang furious, ignorant of True Purpose.*

*Ancient Plan, Magnus’ Betrayal, Mora Tear,
Grief’s Counsel and Mortal Limit.
Mother Mountain, Hawk and Hare,
Foes set against the Voids of Sky.
An Age, New with Creation’s boon,
filled the vessel, mortal’s sight,
blinded by the Gilded Eye.*

*Which in Hermetic rage,
scorched the fields of frozen grief,
liquid flowed, the cold banished by profane radiance.
Ada End revealed to Powers,
Plain of Chance laid bare.
Children of Vengeful Father,
embrace wicked paternal skill,
Voices, cavernous, doom-shout, 
Heavens coiled, twisted in peril.*

*Flesh riven, stripped to Bone,
Song cloven, shaped to Tone,
Spirit ascendance, fatal trap,
Arena, conqueror’s gasp.*

*Victory from Defeat’s Mouth,
Sheo Instruments, primal vibration,
Spirit-bound, Tone CHIME,
Echo image, winged menace.*

*Old Master, searches the Expanse
jealous of the Divine Gift.*

*Enemies arrayed in cold-heat armour,
flashing through the darkness’ gloom.
Tone-kin, thirsty for the Secret,
Bring ruin upon the glacial land.*

*Magnus, his sight obscured,
weeps for the first,
Sons of Snow abandoned,
to the Forests’ Mystery.*

*Yet Sightless Children, 
blind to Nirn,
Shout in protest, fixing tempo through chaos.
Simulacra born, image-made, twin of Breath.*

*Ancestral enemy, 
tuned to the Music,
caused with ignorance of the Deep.*

*Notes frosted, extracted, ordered in haste,
Made Life in Frost-Wind, 
the Blind to see the Echo.*
