[PART 2]

*The following is the official Thalmor report on the investigation of the prolific serial killer commonly known as The Voidwalker.*

**SUSPECT NAME:** Unknown

**ALIASES:** The Voidwalker

**CHARGES:** Numerous murders, kidnappings, mutilations, and other violent crimes.

**CHIEF JUSTICIAR:** Agent Caronil, Department of Dominion Security

**DATE SUBMITTED:** 4E 201, 12th of First Seed

**JUSTICIAR’S REPORT:**

*When Falcano and I apparated at the Adas, it was absolute madness. The demonic woman was exchanging fire with the men and women trapped inside the Adas. The High Priests were summoning great wards while the Justiciars inside hurled fire, lightning, and ice at the woman. The woman was tattered and charred, and yet she still fought. I ordered Falcano to set up the array, which he did with pride. When it was assembled, I drew the attention of the woman and lured her closer. The crowd inside the Adas observed with bated breath. She drew ever closer, taking one terrible step after another. She hurled fire at me, and my ward stood ready to meet it. I backed up towards Falcano, and she followed suit, hurling bolt after bolt of hellfire. I struggled to keep my ward up against the relentless attacks. One after another, the bolts struck the ward, and with each strike, I lost fortitude. The ward broke, and I was left defenseless and fatigued. The woman continued her approach and hurled a firebolt at me. I threw myself to the ground and it narrowly missed. I couldn’t go on. I gave in. I accepted my fate. As she drew nearer and nearer, I could feel the heat radiating off her. Soon she was standing above me.*

*She readied another firebolt. I closed my eyes and prayed to the Ancestors. Suddenly, I heard Falcano shout. There was a shattering sound, and a sudden chill. I opened my eyes in time to see the woman disintegrate to ash and blow to the winds. The crystals that replaced her eyes fell to the ground, and the shards of the soul gem were scattered around the area. I found the strength to stand. Falcano grinned and rambled on about how we were heroes. The boy reminded me of myself when I first joined the ranks of the Department of Dominion Security.*

*More Agents were brought to the scene, and we questioned and examined the survivors of the attack. They all told stories of immolation, hellfire, and the infernos of Oblivion. As for Falcano and I, we went to milsel to have a few glasses of wine. We admired the seductive dances of the miriesse and discussed the events of the day. We spoke far into the night about who or what was behind these attacks and disappearances. Falcano proved to be very educated for his age, drawing possible connections from all across Nirn, and from eras past. Eventually we left the milsel and parted ways for the night, but not before I rewarded Falcano with the crystal eyes of the woman and told him to do all the research he could. I assured him that I would make sure he had access to anything he required.*
