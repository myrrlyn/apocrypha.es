Vanir: 

As I underwent my nightly meditations, I was granted a ~~vision~~ ~~dream~~ in honesty, I am not certain I possess the vocabulary or metaphysical knowledge to describe what beset me. I cannot claim to understand or even comprehend what I saw, save for that I am certain it pertains to the blasphemous House of Troubles. 

This horrifying spectacle has deeply shaken my faith. I hereby resign my post, choosing to become an anchorite for the next score of years. It is my hope that by returning to the wilds my mind will be calmed. 

I have extracted a nooprojection of the vision and [attached it.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwRCUblsbMqRUVlRd1pYSWhkekk/view?usp=sharing) Observe it if you must, but I would recommend sending it to the Buoyant Armigers posthaste. Such things are beyond the ken of simple Ordinators like us.
