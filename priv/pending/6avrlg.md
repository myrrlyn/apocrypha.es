**A poem for my dear, sweet, Mother!**

*The fool of hearts was quick with a knife,*

*The baker was caught by surprise,*

*The jester crept with jovial creeps,*

*And thrust the blade with a turn clockwise.*

*The baker collapsed*

*For he had met his maker,*

*But sadly for him,*

*His trick had no taker.*

*And so I said to the baker,*

*”You're not dead, you're a faker!”*

*”But if that's your wish,”*

*”Then I’ll oblige…”*
