*Transcribed in the Glenumbrian town of Crosswych from a boisterous drunken Bonesettler (Physician) of Clan Torunn-Scorp, a group of Reachmen who worship Chelahoj the demi-prince of poison and alleged daughter of Hircine.*
***


*1.	At the edge of Daggerfall, where Meridia’s light first emerges,*
*There's a caged harpy that sings loud, it has sung for four years:*
*Poor civilized Ciorstag has passed by the dragon chantry and heard*
*In the silence of glistening morn, the mourning song of that bird-woman imprisoned and scorned.*


*2.	'Tis a note of enchantment - what ails this handmaiden of scorpions today?*
*She sees a jaw of frost descending, a vision of Reachmen so decayed;*
*Bright volumes of briar seeds flowing down thru Aldcroft glade,*
*And a river of blood curdling down slew the veil of Daenia.*


*3.	Pale pastures she views, in the midst of a violent gale,*
*Upon which she so often has slipped with her ivory pail.*
*She stands on the summit of dat' Westwyrd Overlock, pondering what she's lost;*
*Close to the sea and the overhead screams of those ever-sailing Betnikh Albatross.*


*4.	She looks afar, and her heart is in the Wild Hunt once more, but all way it fades away for sure,*
*Away with the mist and the river glen, decayed are the rugged hills and the wyrd shade then;*                                                                               
*The streams never flow, the vines will not rise, all is secure in Daggerfall’s orderly gaze,*
*Thus those Daebellan colors now all bleach in fray, forestalled from her embittered ornery daze.*


*5.	Poor Outcast! Return to the wilds—to receive thee once more*
*The house of thy Father will open its twisted boar door,*
*For we promise lenient Hircine shan’t mount your hide upon the floor.*                                                                       *Come to the forests of old once more, only thy plain elk gown shall you adorn,*
*So thou may finally hear them soar, harpies singing of their own blissful accord.*
