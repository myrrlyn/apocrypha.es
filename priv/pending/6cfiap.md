Ah, how you glitter in the moons!

What gravity you hold in the flickering eyes and spider-fingers of men!

Such beauty is your iridescent sheen, and how illustrious the lustful syllables of your name!

How dazzling your visage as you dance amongst your kin!

How thunderous your import, and how sibilant your machinations! How playful your song, and what precise intent you inspire!

How graceful you are against the ebonblack of my hands, wreathed with oiled shadow taken with pride. How truly marvelous you are, my dear little coin.

An zedro di hazura vaba ahziss zato ahziss traajirka jaadi tsin'ra.
