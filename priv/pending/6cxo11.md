O' Woe unto those who try to break her,
to those who'd see her fall,
they'll know what fury looks like when the Northman comes to call. 

O' Fair city of Bees, buzzing around your hive,
be thou joyful in your grief for those yet alive,
and send some goodwill forward,
to those who need it most,
that kindness stops all evils much more than rabid host.

Cowards in the night struck the city fair,
made its tears fall heavily in morose air,
left families without loved ones,
and people with despair,
our great city plunged into Chaos by act most vile.

Alas, the wheels keep on turning,
and the music ever plays,
here in the heart of song,
a mournful lament strong,
do not mess with the Northmen,
your time's soon at an end,
find yourself before us,
and your life will surely end.

Love and prayers from the Divines we beseech.

A tribute to Saarthal.

**But also a tribute to my home city, Manchester, which is suffering a great evil. Please have compassion and don't remove this that this tragedy may never be forgotten.**
