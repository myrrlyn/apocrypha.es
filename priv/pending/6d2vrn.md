Part of my long ago planned orc C0DA, with a view on one of the saints of the time-travelling Orsimer on the moon, who built a colony and seaked about the creation Myth of the Neo-Orsimer. It was later become a Part of my own Fantasy-Universe but i have rebooted it so here the TES-Version and yes. I know! After all my critic about the Obscure-Texts this seems to be a joke, but it is not.

*As the spirit of the Neo-Orsimer combined together, a power they gained after they acquired the Redguards and mated with them, they created their own myth of creation, which is readable in the twenty-seven two Orichalcos volumes, and by power of their mind the volumes became reality.*

In the first New-Kalpa the truth of the Orsimer came into their minds, to which they gave their goal a form:

And the ancient Norayn, the first of the Bornaz-caste slid painful out of his crystal-filled chrome seat and stepped in front of the Neo-Orsimer, his arms firmly grip on his Methamathik walking stick. His knowledge had slipped away from his mind for days and rage spread in him about this.

On the great Nebin-Gos square in Doma in front of the large black column of the Koroyla he proclaimed the truth, which he had received in a fever dream by an ever and never before-seen disease, surrounded by the high-house. But then, just before the new beginning of the Neo-Orsimeric cycle he received the enlightenment he so often and never experienced and his mind began to chime. And he said:

“Oh, sons and daughters of ash! As often as the decline of the non-existent has already examined us and a conquest of being as a burden of our captivity tormented us, I create myself as a creature new to lead you! Thus, I reincarnate myself from cycle to cycle for the preservation of the truth, the destruction of the Mer, and the erection of our Kismet. “

Norayn asked his impossible slaves, for he was a follower of the second Koroyla principle: “Every being is a dream, and one can own it,” to drive him between the armies of the faithful, while he sat in the hovering carriage between his three-head the fourth rise. During the journey thorugh the square, the expedient, the beneficent and the friendly continued, while the dying was screaming in pain:

"The great Agape in Malasith is our everlasting, enveloping and protecting hand, and our goal to the Wahada-Tauhid. In the days before the Mala in the Sithis, he the I-speaking advocate Trinimac, recognized us as the possibility of the new existence of the non-being of the Malasith and found his way to enlightenment by the creation of deeper being, and the procedure of the ungodly metry. For divinity is the existence of being in captivity and thus a sin for all that thinks to be, but can not be. He manipulated the currents of existence and created our colony.

To escape from captivity, he turned his body against space, time, love, and will, with nothing but nothing as a weapon and a taste for the possible future and he attacks. But the incarnations of the disobedience of the great goal prevailed against him and divorced him. They filled Malasith with his rūh, like a protective mantle before being, confirmation of the agony of our existence, right above our heads!"

When he stopped at the center of the army, looked into the green painted sky by the soul of the Trinimac, he began to illuminated by artificial light, he spoke to his people in confidence:

"It is to us to find the sons and daughters of the incarnations of disobedience and to reward them, for their will and their strength, with non-existence, so that they can create the way for us to deeper being. And to achieve our goal, we must destroy the towers of limited being in the form of the bodies of space, time, love, and will. The sons and daughters must be rewarded. Only then will our path be revealed and our ascent guaranteed. "

And the multitude of the edge-frivolous Neo-Orsimer threw themselves on the emerald floor on their knees and tuned the white song of the new jihad. But Norayn continued:

“Recognizes the faith as the masters of the carriage. My body is the wagon, my word the wagoner, and you're thinking the reins. The idea is the animal of the wagon, and the being is the way. “

The one who is full of delusion striving for the pleasure of non-being, recognizes the benefit of the Bornaz, who wanders the land with wisdom and knows wisdom for ever. The Scripture, for which the supreme wisdom found, has only this benefit.

Being and not being, only one leads to salvation. And to the other, the conscious repetition is part of it.
Then Noponeu went up in blue wisdom and turned to ash. The pale-colored remains glided into the wind and merged with the cutis so that each Neo-Orsimer became a two-in-one. The closest thing to the target for the disobedient, the three-in-one.
