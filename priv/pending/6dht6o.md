To my most Magnificent Lady Elenwen,  

Nothing demonstrates the barbarism and intractable idiocy of the Nordic race more than human rantings on the Harpies of Glenumbra. There is even a prevailing “theory” among the Nords that Harpies are actually Ayleids! Ayleids! Can you imagine?! The stupidity that would give rise to such a belief is obviously beyond the comprehension of superior Mer such as us. Fortunately and as always, the glorious Altmer race has provided resolution where the simple minds of men have failed.  We cannot tolerate the slandering of this assuredly tender and sublime species by the lesser races of Nirn.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I have spent nearly fifty years examining Harpy cadavers in great detail. Their bodies are beautiful as they are strong-willed. They never fail to produce a reaction to even the most esoteric of exogenous stressors. At long last, distillation of their alchemical components alongside intensive sensory application has provided me with the final insight into the ontogenesis of the so-called “Harpy.”  
&amp;nbsp;  
My conclusion, as well as the only logical possibility, is that Harpies are actually an ancient subspecies of Dwemer that were left stranded on Nirn after the rest of their kind flew to the moon. On behalf of the great Academies of Alinor, I am submitting an official request that a public announcement be made across Tamriel. I would also ask that my pamphlets be distributed to the local population regularly along with the usual Thalmor paraphernalia. You will find detailed results of my work attached to this letter.  
&amp;nbsp;  
-Gracefully yours,
