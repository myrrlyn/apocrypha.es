*Just wanted to show a possiblity how a Khajiit became a protector of the Mane. Hoe you like it!*

Rhaaz knelt on the marble floor of the protector's estate in Torval and had his eyes closed. His fur had been losing water for several minutes, which dripped from the bright skin under his fur, but he was still breathing calmly and evenly.

For the last seventeen years he ran through the forests of Elsweyr, through the steppes of Khenarthi's Roost, while arrows rained down upon him, like the loose fur of his mother, when he swipes through her fur, while nurtured himself at her teat. The roar of his pursuer still sounded in his big ears and his heart began to beat faster.

“Open your eyes, Rhaaz,” said a lovely female voice, and he obeyed.
In front of him stood a female Phamar, with the most equal colored and most beautiful fur Rhaaz had ever seen. The inside of her paws were tender pink, and when she put them on his paws, they felt as soft as Rhaaz had imagined.

The young Khajiit placed Rhaaz's hands on the altar and looked into his eyes. His claws went out.

Now the recruit looked around and saw the current Mane sit behind a wooden lattice and Rhaaz suppressed the desire to fall instantly to his knees.

Then a biting pain in the paw, the beautiful Khajiit had torn him out the first claw and wetted the wound with a healing potion. She pushed the golden prosthesis into the resulting hole and Rhaaz hissed out, quieter than any other Khajiit would have done in his situation.

He looked back at the Mane, and he waved his ears back and spoken to one of his many consultants. When he turned to this counselor, the innumerable bells rang at the innumerable curls he was wearing.

Again a piercing pain, followed by the wet of the potion and the burning of the metal. In the second paw, Rhaaz did not even show that he is being overwhelmed by the pain. He focused on the beautiful, blue and green eyes of this wonderful Phamar. He was just so grateful to her to be so beautiful, for otherwise he would have burst into tears with pain and have lost his fur in front of the mane.

The tail of the Phamar snuggled slowly closer to Rhaaz and pet his leg, she smiled, looking at the paw.

When the last prosthesis had been installed, the Phamar rose and undressed herself immediately. When she threw off her dress, Rhaaz showed an emotion for the first time in a few minutes and looked around incredulously. His gaze wandered to the mane before his instructor Dahur went to him and whispered in his ear.

Then Rhaaz opened his eyes and stood up, smiling. He had lost his claws and was marked as “clawless”. He was the last few days allowed to scratch a tree. Now he was allowed to do with the Phamar for an hour what ever he wanted. He knew exactly what he would do with this Khajiit, which was so full of fertility, even when he was observed by the instructor, the mane, and hid consultants. At the end of the day, he would lose one of his tails and be given his armor. He would put on the fur and became a protector of the mane.
