**Extract from “The new forging-manual of the 4th era”**

The smith-society of Tamriel knows two types of blacksmiths. The finished-Smiths whom buy finished components and then merely reinforce it to make armor from it. These blacksmiths can produce much more goods in much shorter time and are also the most favorable. Their quality is questionable but for the narrow money bag the ideal starting point for weapons and armor.

Then there are the real Blacksmiths, those who melt the ores into bars, from which they produce their own components with mere manual work, and then produce their weapons and armor (or sell them to the finished-smiths). These forges are more elaborate and clearly more sophisticated. Their work, however, is also much better and can even be customized by the buyer. The price is significantly higher and the duration of a complete armor can be 28 days, in addition to the waiting time.

...

Over the past few centuries, the most successful have been the Blacksmiths. Every adventurer and knight was wearing armor of these capable hands. However, this changed drastically during the 4th era and the reason for this are the dragons.

When the Dragons appeared again in the sky of skyrim, they were extinguished one by one from the dragonborn. Their flesh dissolve, but their heavy bones were preserved, and peasants, wanderers, and citizens from all parts of skyrim found the skeletons and decompose them into their individual parts, in order to make armor made from them. But the Blacksmiths were overburdened, for they could not melt the bones to make bars of them. Even the highest temperatures did not melt the bones.

But then came Darion Bordelair. A Breton finished-smith from solitude and he created the first dragon bone armor, since the days of the dragonborn. A simple finish-Smith had done the task that neither Eorlund Gray-Mane nor the Orks in their fortresses got done. But what was his secret?

His secret was that he could not try to melt the bones at all, because he could not afford a smelting hut. When a customer gave him the bones, Darion only used the skills he possessed. He went to the nearby dragon skeleton and took himself the bones, which looked like the components, which he otherwise always bought. The shoulder blade looked like a helmet, the basin like a cuirass and the claws like blades. At the end he reinforced the bones with steel and leather in the inside, for a more pleasant wearing comfort. He created a fully Dragonbone-Armor within of 2 Hours.

Within a few weeks adventurers, nobles, and knights from all countries stormed his little shop and bought him armors at a fair price. Darion is by far the most prosperous finished-Smith of Tamriel and has bought himself a small island in Illiac-Bay. So if you want to create a dragon armor, you have to do it like a finished-Smith. A finished-Smith who was laughed at by other forges. But the laughter does not penetrate Darion's island.
