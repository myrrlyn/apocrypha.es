I knelt in the ashes of the temple in Ald'ruhn and slapped my hands, closed my eyes. I lowered the two index fingers and said, "For the mother Ayem, your time has not come."

Then I lowered the ring fingers, finally the little fingers. "For Seht, who will not honor us with his knowledge today."

After all, only my middle fingers were stretched out and I lowered my head. The tips of my two outstretched fingers rested on my nasal tip, and I could feel the air coming from my nose. And I said the prayer:

"Vehk, my Savior and Prince. Hear me!

I go down in the sea.

Without you I am alone.

Time is without you stiff as stone.

You do not have to waste the second.

If you are there, the snakes are silent on the branches and praise your legend.

You fill the battlefield ditches with your pure life.

You, the man and the wife. "

I crossed my middle finger to a Vehk, opened my bloodstained eyes and lifted my hand to the shrine of Vivec. Then I lower my hand and press the middle fingers together. I spoke the next prayer:

"I'll go through the ditches, where you last saw me.

Until the evening i will never be able to be.

The country is so black and empty.

The snakes do not sing to me!"

Again, I lifted my crossed fingers and finally led them back to my nose. I spoke the next prayer.

"I will see my body burn, and I will go down with my skin and hair.
I will put the dagger into injustice and lick this concept of my glare.
Sex is a battle. Love is war and you are our warrior.

Lord Vehk hear me. Lord Vehk lead me! "

I finally got up, rubbed something from the ashes of the ancestors in my face and left the temple of Vivec.
