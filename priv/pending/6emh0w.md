The southwestern island kingdom, which we call Pyandonea, is equally interwoven with legends and errors, which can be rejected on the whole by the recent expedition of the secondary tribunal, consisting of Indoril Nerevar, Voryn Dagoth, and Lord Kagrenac.

The archipelago is located in surprisingly calm waters, not far from Tamriel and consists of a large, paradisiacal main island with countless smaller islands around it.

There were rumors about possible population, but there is not a single elf on the entire archipelago. The island is nevertheless not uninhabited.

Whoever ran close to the seas around Tamriel or the edge of Skyrim will see the inhabitants of Pyandone: the Dreugh.

The red land and sea crabs, as they are called in the People's mouth, are the people of the jungle paradise and have completely covered the archipelago with corals.

In the center of the main island is a huge statue of the slave-King of Coldharbour. And it is really huge. According to Voryn's measurements, the statue measures a little less than a kilometer high and is as wide as the palace in the Imperial-City of the humans. 

On the skull is a third horn, which is the tip of the underwater palace of the Dreugh usurper, Phunguli Maglanah-Wallah. The secondary tribunal even had an audience with the usurper, and described it as unlikely in the following report, surrounded by the light of the tower.
Further expeditions to Pyandonea are not planned.
