The Realms of Existence can interpret and parallel by anything. But I want to try and draw out on the metaphysical side relation between the Aurbis, It's realms, and the Five Worlds based on the Kabbalah. Fair warning, I'm no expert behind this but the though is too much to let go of.

---

&gt;Greetings, novitiate, and know first a reassurance: Mankar Camoran was once like you, asleep, unwise, protonymic. We mortals leave the dreaming-sleeve of birth the same.

&gt; All creation is subgradient. First was Void, which became split by AE. Anu and Padomay came next and with their first brush came the Aurbis. 

Atziluth: The World of Emanation. The first world. It is the Infinite united source of the Ein Sof. It precludes the souls and Divine emanations in Atzilus from sensing their own existence. It would come into existence when the first Sephirot, Keter, emerges along the other Sephirots. It represents the Sephirot, Chokhmah for Wisdom. This would fit with where the souls, The Children of Anu, the Hist and Ehlnofey, entering in the Aurbis; Anu's Emanations the Et'ada would then later derived afterwards and model a particular sphere. Atziluth would parallel to the Dreamsleeve, where all souls return to the source of the AE. But It would also fit in with Aetherius since the Dreamsleeve is a part it which leads to next second world.

&gt;The stars are our links to the plane of Aetherius, the source of all magical power, and therefore, light from the stars is the most potent and exalted of all magical powers.

&gt;The marriages of the Aether describe the birth of all magic. Like a pregnant [untranslatable], the Aurbis exploded with its surplus. Will formed and, with it, the Potential to Action. 

Beri'ah: The World of Creation, the realm of the Divine Throne, denoting the sephirot configuration of Atzilus descending into Beriah. It's the Sephirot Binah for understanding. It would represent Aetherius, the realm of raw create and the higher realm. Fitting as the Beri'ah is the higher garden of Eden. With Aetherius and the Dreamsleeve, (Atzilus and Beri'ah) the AE and Animus can bring about creation and fill the Void, the third realm.

&gt; Another subcreation happened to the wheels of the etada, a shore that all of creation crashed against, the terminus of limits known as Oblivion. An echo of the Void before but unalike, many spirits fled here and came to power by merely harnessing the impossibility of Limit+All. Aetherius to Oblivion: creation to destruction. 

Yetzirah: The World of Formation, the Lower Garden of Eden. Here created beings assuming shapes and forms. It's associated with the Sephirots Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod and Yesod. Yetzirah is a realm that is also called half good and half evil. The half-evil being self-consciousness of the beings of this world, and half good being the emotional sensitivity of one to the other as expressed in the genuine desire to make the other happy. It would fit as Oblivion being as it's a pandimentional realm where the Daedra have an ever-changing shape and/or form. With their spheres embodying their self-consciousness/Plane(t)s reflecting and the other aspects.

&gt;We begin to see the first inkling of emergence, which by its nature requires the merging of two-fold powers. Inevitably, this leads to another gradient, but this time by forceful process: the Trap of the Lunar God. The Aedra are Named at this time, having lent their hands to what was to be the arena of the eternally impossible: Mundus, or Exactness. Oblivion to Mundus: debris of all possibility to anchor of all things.

Assiah: World of Action. Assiah is parallel to Mundus, Nirn, Dawns Beauty, The Princedom of Lorkhan. It was the actions of Lorkhan who created his realm so that mortals can acend to fulfill the his endeavor. Assiah is the Sephirot of Malkuth, the lowest emanation of the Kabbalah but the most significant one of all. It has it's own unique spiritual qualities as it gives tangible form to the other sephirots. Malkuth also translate to kingdom and also identifies with royalty. Hence Mundus is the emanation for which CHIM/Royalty can be attained. Why? Because like the Malkuth, the Kether is within the Malkuth as it is also within the Kether. As Above so Below. 

Which leads to the Fifth World or in our case the Nu-Man, Amaranth.

---

&gt;The New Man becomes God becomes Amaranth, everlasting hypnogogic. Hallucinations become lucid under His eye and therefore, like all parents of their children, the Amaranth cherishes and adores all that is come from Him.

&gt;"Anu encompassed, and encompasses, all things."

The Fifth World is Adam Kadmon. Who is the Primordial Man and Divine will for Creation. It stands out from the four worlds but it's also what brought about the them as well. AK represents the Keter: Crown and is all the embodiment of the sephirots attributes. Adam Kadmon is the realm of infinite divine light without vessels, with future potential of to create existence. This is associating the spirit of Man itself for contributing creation.

This Would fit with Anu and The Nu-Man. Anu was the previous Nu-Man, encompassing all and was the infinite light beyond all that could reach it. He was in the image of the Godhead but was traumatize and dreamed a realm of his own pain and suffering. Jubal-Sul is the next Nu-Man who will presumably achieve where Anu couldn't and Dream the New World.
