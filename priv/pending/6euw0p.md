Thank you, my review of the literature you sent me has been most fruitful. I am humbled as always by your generosity. I have been meaning to ask you something. Have you considered the parallels between the behavioral patterns of man and that of the Imga—the ape beastfolk of Valenwood?  
  
The idea is not so strange as it may seem at first glance. Ask yourself, when you look upon a Khajiit, does your mind not naturally drift towards the form of a cat? Similarly, when you look upon a Man, does your mind not naturally drift towards the form of an ape or perhaps even a troll? I merely state the obvious, that creatures belonging to this class must share some kind of biological and historical connection.  
  
Indeed, you may be surprised to know an ape was even the prophet of their human religion for a time!  It’s true! And still to this day, just like Talos, they stubbornly insist on worshipping their monkey gods. Travelers have reported that humans in the Iliac Bay commemorate their ‘Monkey Prophet’ every 9th of Second Seed. Whether or not Alessia herself was an ape of this kind is yet to be determined. However, we can clearly see that the origins of human rebellion are apish in nature.  
  
Unlike the Imga, who accepted their inferiority with contentment, there seems to be something intractable in man that insists on separation from their Elven caretakers. Like the Imga, they continue their imitation of civilized society, but do so with resentment instead of grace. It is the tragedy and of Man’s existence that he has yet to produce anything rivaling the accomplishment of real society. As point of fact, everything of value in human society is Elven in origin. Need I point to the Imperial City, constructed by the Elves and yet, like a child, man continues to act as though he created his little world all by himself? Despite this, he continues to stubbornly refuse his proper subordinate position within the hierarchy of nature.  
  
Many believe that Man's rebellious instinct is cause for humanity to be eliminated, but in my heart I believe that these creatures can be rehabilitated to the service of civilization. It is with great pains that I have attempted to appeal to the primitive mind of man, in hopes that somewhere he may understand the justness of his subordination. I also ask that alchemical solutions should perhaps be considered to quash Man’s rebellious instincts. I realize this would be a huge undertaking. But I continue to believe that Man is capable of being a bountiful resource for society. He simply needs the proper guidance. We appreciate the continued patience of the Great Aldmeri Dominion.  
  
-Sincerely
