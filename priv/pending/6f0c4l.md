*This letter was found next to a Bosmer corpse found halfway under the root of a massive Hist Tree near the city of Stormhold*

The Trees. They are talking, whispering, plotting. They spill lies upon us. They become to us, to forsake our Bosmeri forms and become one with the marsh. Blasphemy against Y'ffer. Yet, the more I reject them, the stronger they call out. If the others weren't telling me they heard the same things, I'd have thought my Rotmeth had been dosed with Skooma. The voices are pounding in my ears, lisping their demands. Their demands of my soul and body, to join the hive. 

I thought it was myth. The Lizard freaks were right that they were sentient, but not of their intent. These trees are evil and must be stopped. I can feel their presence, even as I lay at the inn, far away from their maliciousness.

I will start tomorrow to end these demon trees. They will fall by my hand, if it is the last thing I ever do. 

*Lorn Barstuun*


*Stormhold Rangers Recruit*
