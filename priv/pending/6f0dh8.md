"We of the KYN do not fear death. But Pain is the bane of all KYN. We know and fear it."

"As the Gates opened, the fodder of Scamps we send to Nirn first rushed through the portal, followed by the Churls. Hardly any of the Churls got to the portal before, they came. Larger than any Clanfear, with fangs twice the sharpness and the strength of a hundred KYN came pouring into Lord Dagon's domain. As the first wave entered, us of the higher castes immediately fell back to protect the sigil. It was to no avail. The monsters, seemingly made from those you mortals call Argonians, â€‹ tore through our kin with a fury unlike anything any mortal had shown before. We began hurling fire at them from above, but it simply bounced off their scales. Seeing defeat, we removed our sigil, closing the Gate, and trapping the monsters in Oblivion, where they wander forever in search of KYN blood. It is said amongst you mortals that the Blackened Marsh is unconquerable, and there is truth to your words. Not even my Lord of Destruction could assault the hellish swamps. May Dagon keep us."
