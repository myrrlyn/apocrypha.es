Once upon a time there was a beautiful maiden who wed a handsome Thane of Hjaalmarch Hold. They lived happily in Mortal, producing a son in their first year of marriage. Torviir was an odd child. He never cried as an infant, or argued as a toddler. No, this boy was a strange one. The children in the village all picked on him mercilessly, but still, Torviir said  nothing. 

One day, after Torviir had reached adolesence, Galnar, the son of the Jarl, decided to start a fight with Torviir, and pushed him down outside the longhouse while Torviir was carrying firewood home. When Torviir didn't react, Galnar jeered, "Say something freak!" Torviir simply looked at the boy with the same unblinking, staring eyes, remaining perfectly silent.

Later that night, Galnar awoke in a strange cabin, and when he came too, he heard a voice.

"Wake up. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Aeri Numibia, assassin of the Dark Brotherhood. I thought you'd like to make peace with someone before you died."

As she spoke, another person stepped out of the shadows. Torviir had a wild smile on his face.

Galnar looked at Torviir and pleaded, "Please, help me, tell her not to kill me, you can stop this, just say something." Torviir's smile widened, as again, he said nothing at all.
