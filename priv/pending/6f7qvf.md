*[Written excerpt from the black box of the helmet of Phaulius Patrem, agent of the imperial legion on the first and last day of the Mer war]*

3rd Era 1

Valerius sat on one of the two benches in the Natet-Copter. The levitation-jetz on the wings boomed in his ears as he checked his dark armor.

"They're going to make kill us!" Cried Spearman Salis, the pilot of this copter.

Valerius hung himself in the winch, and leaned out of the cabin, watching the impetuous jungle of the province of Cyrodiil. Countless small fire-places blazed under the tree-roof, and only the smoke made the size of these fires guessable.

Valerius gave a snarl, rather than returning to his comrades. He crossed his eyes with Agent Phaulius, his right hand.

He raised an eyebrow. "Bad feeling, sir?" The agent asked, checking his rifle.

Valerius jaw shrugged briefly, which was the closest thing to a feeling outburst of him. He was rather calm and prudent, but he could not freak out by anything.

Magna, the giant, muscular, Redguard warrior, struck Phaulius against his back and laughed with her deep, groaning laughter. "It will be easy, you bitch!" She yelled, smiling. "To kill a few Sharp-Eaers and that was it for us."

"Yes, wow. You know? Fuck you. This was also said to us at the beginning of the animal war against the lizards and cats. Do you remember? Is a long time ago, so round about 10 fucking years?" Phaulius crossed his arms.

A crack in the ears of the soldiers sounded. Salis talked about dreamsleeve-communication. "Did you not shit today, Phaulius? You semm uncomfotable, what's going on ?!"

Valerius looked like Magna to the agent. "I'll be right there through this fucking communicator, ey!"

"Woah, calm down," Valerius said, looking at the agent with his deep blue eyes. "She's just make fun."

"Aha. She can fuck herself. I want to go home! My wife now has a child, I want to be there for both!"

Silence appeared in the cabin, which was only filled with the engine noise that was no longer worth mentioning for every soldier.

"Oh gods!" Magna suddenly cried. "You have reproduce yourself ?! We should go there, not with this war! His brood is much more harmful than anything else!"

Valerius's mouth raised slightly, and Phaulius laughed. "Is a daughter. Belia is her ne. She has a fire-red hair." He grabbed his ass and took a photo from his back pocket, showed it Magna.

She smiled and wrinkled her nose. "She's cute! Good that she has so much of her mother, and not of you."

Phaulius snapped her photo away. "Would you like to see it, Protector?"

Valerius smiled and Magna and Phaulius struck the breath at the same time.

"He's smiling, Salis!"

"Autopilot!" The pilot yelled, came back into the chamber and looked briefly at Valerius before she went back to the joystick. "Now we can all die! We've seen everything possible. A woman who lets herself be nailed by Phaulius and a Valerius who smiles. Gods, gives us strength! The end is near!"

Valerius laughed softly. "Is a really cute child." He returned the photo to him.

"Well, ladies!" Salis cried. "Now we are landing. You know the commands. Out, kill, overthrow, survive. Especially you, Daddy-Phalius."

When the Copter came deeper and deeper, four circular saws sailed from the ground of the aircraft and cut down the trees in a small circle, creating a landing zone.

When the Copter finally landed, the three soldiers jumped out and were hit directly by the sultry warmth of the jungle of Cyrod.

"Talos says he knows how much we hate the jungle, but he does not move his wrinkle ass a little to get rid of him," Phalius said, blowing air through his lips.

"Keep moving," Valerius said, and Magna rushed forward, the particle-gun in her hand.
The way through the jungle was heavy and tiring, but the Legion's soldiers were used to it. It is not that it has become easier through their training, but rather that it is just not as much as striking how tiring this sultry was.

After a few hours, Magna lifted her hand and her companions glanced over the jungle over their visions. A few serpents snaked along the trees.

"Oh, with Shor's bones," whispered Phalius, and suddenly something jumped out of the tree on Magna and clapped with two daggers on her back. The massive armor of the legionaries, however, protected her, so that she got hold of the enemy and broke his neck with a single movement.

Immediately they all hurried to the corpse, which was thrown by Magna with a loud crack against a tree. This thing had dark skin and red eyes, very similar to the black-red leather armor that it wore.

"All right, Magna?" Valerius asked and the Redguard grinned.

"Sure, of course."

"What is that shit-face?" Phaulius asked. "The eyes are so damn big and the ears?"

"This is a so-called mer. They are from the summerset-islands and we should kill them, if possible. So-called Mission, you know?"

"Ah. Yes."

When they were about to turn away from the corpse, Valerius heard a hissing sound, and a fireball came to hoit him right on the chest. He hurled back with great force and was caught by Magna, while Phaulius stood in front of both, the weapon ready to attack.

Suddenly a Mer jumped out of the forest and rushed to the agent with magical lightnings in his hands. It was a master of destructive-Magic. A Lord-of-Spells, who can control the elemnts by his owns, strong will!

Being secure of his victory, the mer laughed, and Phaulius gave a single shot in flight. The particle dig through the enemy's skull, and the enemy sank lifeless to the ground like a sack.
"Pft. Pussy," Said Phaulius, and went to Valerius.

He stood up by now and was all right. The armor did not even have a scratch. "Fire? Is that all they can?" Magna asked.

"Seems so."

A tremendous tremor shook the three soldiers and the day become dark. All three looked up, towards the Imperial-City. Above the White-Gold-Tower stood a huge, white ball, it was Secunda.

Suddenly the clouds broke over the land and Masser hovered over the white Moon, right at the top of the tower.

Valerius immediately took his binoculars and looked at the two moons, above the capital. In front of these rock-giants stood a gold-gray man, who seemed to be flying with a spear in his hand and outstretched arms. Valerius activated the acoustic amplifiers of his equipment and heard the two-colored man breath.

The man clenched both hands and yelled. "Shina da Bet nashi Riel!"

And Masser bounced on Secunda and a huge shock wave arose.
Worn out of instinct, Valerius threw his generator to the ground and created a bubble shield around him and his comrades before the shock wave destroyed everything around them.

It takes more than two hours before the shock wave leaves the land and Valerius' shield get deactivated.

When they looked up, the entire jungle, which the Red Legion hated so much, had disappeared. On the gray hills of the wasteland of Cyrodiil, there seemed more bubble shields as golden domes aournd the hills. The war was over now.
