*This text was salvaged from a ravaged Telvanni tower shortly after the Argoninan invasion following the Red Year. The text is burned and soiled by blood and grime in many places, and was found next to a pile of ash under a hole to the sky in the ruined tower.*

&amp;nbsp;

...they are almost here now. It's impossible to think that the Argonians, whom for millennia we regarded as mere slaves and test subjects, are capable of this. How did they know this would happen? I cannot fathom it...

&amp;nbsp;

...I have used my knowledge of teleportation spells to send away the women and children. I can only only hope that the old Imperial fort at Firewatch still stands, and that some kind soul will show them mercy. I must go now. I will not cower at the top of my tower; I will face death with the dignity befitting a wizard of Great House Telvanni. Gods willing, I shall take as many of those lizards with me as I can...

&amp;nbsp;

... how cruel... I am gravely wounded, stuck at the precipice of life, unable to fall into death. That lizard... he knew me. He was one of my slaves, before he was freed by abolitionists. He singled me out... told me just how long he'd waited for this moment, how he'd gone to great lengths and sacrifices to perfect his revenge. He overpowered me... I couldn't resist his magic, nor his curse. He showed me what they did to the people outside. Horrific things. The way he talked about it, how he reveled in it... I turned to look at him and saw his fangs bared wide...
