*[Excerpt from the speech of Emperor Pelagius Septim. Two days after the attack of the Mer against the Imperial-City.]*

[A german Banner for the Legion](http://i.imgur.com/ofT01Cm.png)

"The empire of Tamriel still exists, our law still exists, and our social alliances still exist. We can no longer be in a state of war like this, but we still have a struggle to survive and a Empire to rule and rebuild, and in these hard days there is no tolerance of lawlessness and antisocial behavior. The Unity has defeated the Cats and the Lizards, these are now our Allies, but the disunity will be the definite end of all of us.

I wear the title of emperor for only two days, I would not even be here if Talos had not hanged himself after the attack. And so I thank you, citizens, for the confidence that you put to me. I will do everything I can to bear the burden of this title, like Ysgramara once did! But what can I know, you may ask. I know a lot!

I know we will all die if we do not get the coals out of the fire of war. The enemy came as a surprise, he came for destruction, but the enemy is still here in Cyrodiil, here in our homeland, and we can not allow that!

Cyro-Nord! The war is nothing unknown to us. After all, we have fought as long as we can remember. War is all we know. In the past, we fought for Skyrim. We fought for Cyrodiil. We fought for freedom and civilization on the strangest part of this continent.

But this has changed after the previous attack. Since this attack, we are fighting for our survival against inhuman, genocidal monsters called Mer. But it is a struggle we can not continue for a long time.

Humanity faces extinction if we do not end this war right now. We had hoped that our technological superiority would decimate the Mer with there useless Magic. But they survived. And have attack back, stronger than an enemy ever before. They have brought him with them, Vivec, a force that can annihilate whole existences. Even the White-Gold-Tower our last lighthouse of hope through all these dark days, is now endangered.

Scouts reported me a few hours ago that Cheydinhal and Anvil, Kvatch and even Bravil and Leyawiin have fallen to the Hands of our enemys. They are under the control of Mer. Only Bruma and the Imperial-City still stand between us, the free Cyrod and the sharp-eared traitors of the Mer!

Soon we have nothing more to defend. And that means we have only one option: Attack! Legionaries, what I now ask of you is no easy task, but it is necessary. If we want to survive. If we want to live long enough to see the seasons change, while our children are growing and if we want to experience a time of peace that we have never known, then we must now carry this fight against the mer in our country.

We will go where they are and we will destroy them! This is the day when we bring the fight to the heart of the enemy. This is the day when we correct the course of mankind's history! This is the day when we ensure our survival as a species! The legionaries of the empire, my comrades, go out and bring back the hope of mankind!"
