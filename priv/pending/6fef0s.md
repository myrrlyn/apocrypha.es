**The oath of the Legion of the Empire of Tamriel**

[The official Banner of the Legion!](http://i.imgur.com/ZnuaLDd.png)

"I am the extended arm of the Empire of Tamriel, and with my deeds and behavior, I represent the dragon, and I am responsible for my actions, and will behave myself honorably.

My responsibilities are the citizens of the empire whom I am willing to defend, and I am faithful and humble to them. We are the element of something greater, the empire. And without the empire we are nothing.

My responsibility is our society. I understand my place in it and respect every other place. I will respect, defend and work with them to keep the empire prosperous.

My responsibilities are the next generations. The children and their descendants. With them in my back, with them in my mind and as a goal, I will march into the battle and conquer my enemy, in accordance with the brotherhood and comradeship of the Legion.

I am a legionary!"
