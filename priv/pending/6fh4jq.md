There is much on record of the city of Davon's Watch. Located in the Stonefalls region of Morrowind, it was controlled by House Indoril during the Alliance War of the Second Era.

It is also well documented that the Daggerfall Covenant, the alliance of Orcs, Bretons, and Redguards, attacked the city during the Alliance War. The Indoril Grandmaster, Tanval, was said to have unleashed an ancient evil, a Daedra known as Balreth, in order to break the siege of the city. Balreth was subsequently rebound. 

Little else is on record about the city, with nothing at all bring written during the Third Era. Strangely enough, no Indoril have been willing to tell what happened to the city. Upon visiting the area where the city stood, there was nothing remotely looking like a city, save for burned brick and ruined towers. 

The only explanation that I can envision is that someone (an Indoril, or an enemy of House Indoril) managed to release Balreth once more, but did not succeed in binding the great evil again. Regardless, the city of Davon's Watch is no more, and with no records and no testimony, we may never know why.
