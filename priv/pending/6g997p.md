**With their weapons, the legionaries hit their shields and shook the earth beneath their feed. Their goal was the domination of the cats, which they found only elsewhere. And while the 1.2 million marched through the steppes, the sand, the earth, and the cities, the cats became because of one thing most afraid. The song which they sang, while their beatings have accompanied them:**

"The cats can run on for a long time

but sooner or later the Gods'll cut you down

Go tell that long haired liar.

Go and tell that midnight prayer.

Tell the rambler,

The gambler,

The sugar biter.

Tell 'em that the Gods gonna cut 'em down

***

Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news.

My head's been wet from the travel dew.

I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Cyrodiil.

He spoke to me in the voice of Shor so sweet.

I thought I heard the shuffle of Kynes feet.

She called my name and my heart stood still

When she said, "Go do My will!"

Go tell that long haired liar.

Go and tell that midnight prayer.

Tell the rambler,

The gambler,

The sugar biter.

Tell 'em that the Gods gonna cut 'em down

***

You can run on for a long time.

But sooner or later the Gods gonna cut you down.

Well you may take your teeth and hide claws in your hand.

Workin' in the dark against my fellow man.

But as sure as God made black and white

what's down in the dark will be brought to the light

Go tell that long haired liar.

Go and tell that midnight prayer.

Tell the rambler,

The gambler,

The sugar biter.

Tell 'em that the Gods gonna cut 'em down

***

You can run on for a long time

But sooner or later the Gods gonna cut you down

Go tell that long haired liar.

Go and tell that midnight prayer.

Tell the rambler,

The gambler,

The sugar biter.

Tell 'em that the Gods gonna cut 'em down

Tell your gods we gonna cut you down!"
