The following is the work of a madman. The subject, who has not been identified, washed up along the Gold Coast, near Anvil. Upon his discovery, he was taken into custody by the Penitus Oculatus on the first of Sun’s Dawn, 4E 199. Before his interrogation could begin, an agent found the man to be brutally dismembered on the second day of Sun’s Dawn. His remains were arranged in a macabre display that was very obviously arranged very carefully. In the center of the display, a letter was nailed into the decapitated head, and it read as such:
 
*The master will visit today, he’s promised I that. He says he will break I out of this cell and me will be free forever and always. Me and I love the master, and hate these damndest men who have taken we prisoner. Myself is so excited to see master after all this time. To those men who have sealed the-master’s-servant-who-is-I, we must say goodbye. As such, myself has wrote this epistle for the keepings of your filthy eyes. The master calls me, so we must now go.*
