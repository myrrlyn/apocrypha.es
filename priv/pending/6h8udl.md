Fragments of Annales Cyrodilenses

Volume XXIII

As great as his [Potentate Versidue-Shaie's] administrative talents were, his reign was immediately met with problems. Cyrodiils or Imperials, as they were staring to be known as, descendants of Alessia and proud cornerstone of the Great Empire or Man, could not accept being ruled by what they considered beastmen.

During his brief reign, Emperor Attrebus Artaxes issued the Expulsion Act of 484, sending all individuals of Akaviri descent into exile under the threat of death and forbidding non-Cyrodiils from holding public offices. This act caused an outrage in Elsweyr, widening the already huge rift  between two peoples. The Khajiit enthusiastically welcomed the Akaviri refugees, seeing them as comrades of hardship, and let them settle in their territory of Anequinan Rim. Little did they expect, that the treacherous Tsaesci would take it as deed of gift and later try to tear that land away from the country of their benefactors…
