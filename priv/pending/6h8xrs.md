So, for a time, the Imga joined the rest of Tamriel. Some served in the Legions, fighting against the Direnni or other enemies of the Empire. Some became priests, monks, traveling friars; there are rumors that some even sought Artaeum and learned the magical arts. 

It was not to last. Though the example of Marukh was powerful, showing what the Imga could become in the wider world, the ape-folk could not escape the sense that the Empire only barely tolerated them. By the time of the Battle of Glenumbra, they had returned to the Wood, or scattered to the remote corners of the continent.

Over the long decline of the Alessian Empire the Imga became the patsy of Imperial propaganda. Stories of effeminate apes dressed in human clothes, later modified in Tiber's Empire as the Elf-loving apes with oafish names, became commonplace.  In the deeps of the Wood, the Imga gave no hint if they knew or cared.
