*this text was recovered from the corpse of an Ascended Sleeper outside Balmora in 3E 427 by Zari Earthen, a retainer of House Redoran who seemed to be the brother of the Sleeper*

I have awoken to the Truth of House Dagoth. Soon my master will be master of all. Bugs. All of those who still sleep will awaken, orbe crushed like insects under the boot of might Dagoth Ur. The mountain, THE MOUNTAIN. The moubtain holds all. Dead Gods, Cores and Cruxes, Hearts. The heart of our woken state. We will take our place as the rulers of Resdayn, and then all of Tamriel. We cannot be stopped. The divine essence runs through my veins. I am a TINY GOD! Under the master, we will become him. We will all be Dagoth Ur, and all be GODS! The masses will fight and be exposed to the truth. The Empire is false, the Great Houses are false! The only house is Dagoth and the only Emperor is Dagoth Ur. We are his hands and feet. Our crusade will not go unrewarded. All will fall to Dagoth. Awaken, my brethren, and Ascend to a new paradise, of Truth!
