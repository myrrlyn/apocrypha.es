Why We Love Orcs

Dear Orsimer, I , Eorlund Quick - Arrow,  wish to apologise for my previous work [“Why We Hate Orcs”](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/6i6dm7/why_we_hate_orcs/).That  piece was written while in a rage following a lost bet with an Orc associate of mine.  In order to fully present my apology, I present to you, “Why We love Orcs”


All across Tamriel, the Orcs are celebrated as excellent blacksmiths, although they may lack the ability of us Nords. they are capable of making weapons and armour as powerful as it is ugly. They do not seem overly concerned with it's appearance and I respect that pragmatism.  A true warrior does not care about his looks and does not care for the opinions of those beneath him. My words have shown myself to be beneath the Orcs. 


The Orcs are a strong and determined people. No matter how many times an Orcish stronghold is destroyed, the Orcs will always return and try to rebuild. Their persistent attempts to rebuild Orsinium display this tenacity, that the Orcs are famous for.  Many criticise this persistence and suggest the Orcs should instead make a home amongst other races. However,  is the Orcish search for a home not similar to our own Ysgramor leading us from Atmora,  or the Redguards arrival from Yokuda.  All other races have found their home and who are we to deny them that.


Although the Orsimer are technically Elves, they had nothing to do with the Sack of Saarthal, and have never been a dishonourable enemy to us as the Snow Elves were. To compare the Orsimer to our most evil foes, dishonours myself  and dishonours the sacrifice of our ancestors who died to free this land from the Snow Elves. 
 

I fear that those unfair opinions expressed in my earlier book may find support among the Stormcloaks or other extreme groups that plague Skyrim. Those opinions were inspired by anger and excessive mead and do not represent the views of any true Nord, A true Nord knows when to admit his mistakes and does not use cowardly words to criticise his foes.  I once again extend my deepest apologies and offer to purchase a mug of mead for any Orc offended by my words. I know this apology may draw criticism from some of my Nordic brothers but a real Nord accepts his mistakes and acts to rectify them. In Kyne’s name, I am truly sorry.


Eorlund Quick-Arrow, 
Shamed Nord of The Rift
