Safe in their jungle kingdoms, the Imga lived for centuries until the coming of the Last War. What role they played in Ald Tamriel's final conflict even the Prophet does not know.  None, it seems, were registered by the Divine C0dex and the Bosmer of Nu-Valenwood offered no report of the ape-folk.

In the 6th era there are those who have emerged from the Wood of Tamriel Renewed: warriors, wizards, diplomats, void sailors. The sight of Imga is not common, but they are not unknown. They speak little of their home, and say nothing of Landfall. Are they of the Remembered, or did they escape the wrath of Numidium? The Imga do not say.

Their arrival has not been without resistance.
