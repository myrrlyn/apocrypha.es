# The House That Never Was
### An Alternate Timeline
## Part 0: Introduction

Everyone here had heard the tale of Tiber Septim: how he came to unite Tamriel in the course of a few short decades. But, what if, instead of a single person uniting Tamriel within a short period of time, it was a group of people, uniting Tamriel over a period of hundreds of years?

In this alternate timeline, **Tiber Septim/Talos never existed.** In his place is the Breton dynasty of Endel, whose members slowly expanded their territory to encompass all of Tamriel over the course of hundreds of years.

In these tales, you will find a vastly different story of how the Tamrielic Empire came to be. You will find that instead of it being a short poem, it will be a long epic, possibly lasting a millennium.

The first volume of the lore of this alternate timeline will be in the format of a chronicle/history book written by a Breton scholar in the year 2E 597, twenty-eight years after the Endels united High Rock.

I will hope to put out a part of this alternate history's lore each week. I'll also try to answer any questions you have about this in the comments.
