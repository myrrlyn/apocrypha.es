*Our world is composed of energy, much of it pouring out from the Aetherius. Within each of us is a spark of the infinite, a whirlpool of potential. For we are star-stuff, born into this world as crude matter. It is in this way that we are connected to the Stars and is the reason Star Signs are believed to be so influential in mortal life.*

*Knowing this, we must learn to harness the universe's infinite energy. As a mystic, I have delved into the world's secrets and have learned how to siphon energy from the world around me. In each of us is the spark of Creation which allows us to shape infinite stasis into finite chaotic acts. And in every one of these acts we recreate the Primal Struggle which is Aurbis, Gray Maybe.*

*Thus, it is simply a matter of reaching out with your mind and grasping the energy of the world that surrounds you. Hold this tight in your hands and allow the power of the universe to flow through you, down into your fingers and out into the world you intend to shape. Energy is in all life, in every creature, plant, star, and even the elements. Even the vessels intended to capture such energy are composed of energy. Simply break them down and release their potential.*

*Do this and nothing will be impossible for you. Your Acts will rival even the gods and shall make the Oblivion Lords tremble! The world is yours to reach out and take!*
