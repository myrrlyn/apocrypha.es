*Fire God, dark lord, kill, make, destroy, all die from his hand of fear. Vile heat, a sword of rage, dead soul, sun of Dawn, son of light, fish of light, make way for his glory, all pass on from his gaze. Sun up high, the scourge in hand, razor clutched, burnt land, army gone, hope kept, Lyg fell and fish is king now. Bow now to the Lord, he who is the heart of fire and soul of the Dawn. Love is gone, lost to dark, Dagon stays to break the weak and raise the strong. Meet now his gaze and reach for blood as his fire burns all and the Red Dream of Dagon turns all things to fell ash. Look, the Dawn comes, an Age of flame, of light, of dread for the weak. Praise be to the Lord, jumping ever against this world and its sins.*
