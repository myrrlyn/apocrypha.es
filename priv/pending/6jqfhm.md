The Preface of a 7 year study on the foreign pantheon published by the Anka-Totambu Association Titled: Tissa-no-Loigri, The Nine Decievers.

*While our Forebear cousins and the natives encourage us to blindly accept their gods we cannot leave our obviously better gods. We also cannot deny that these gods of their exist, so some Anka-Yokeda have come together and set up the Tukta-no-Yoke,  Divine Standards, for our na-Totambu to these Tamrielic dieties.*

*Akosh- whose insanity assisted the jumbling of worlds.*

*Kynt- whose breath drives the final spirits back to their birth tombs.*

*Dibel- whose milk and nectar are an intoxicating diversion.*

*Arkay- whose boat ferries the disbelievers to muddied waters.*

*Jhunol- Lo’igra-no-shira whose logic betrayed his logic.*

*Marra-  whose mirror is dull and dusty.*

*Zenith- Lo’igra-no-shira whose honest ethic is acceptable.*

*Stendra- Lo’igra-no-shira whose Mercy knows few bounds.*

*Sep- Yokeda-no-Lo’igra whose hunger drives mad, whose treachery boundless, whose deception is law.*
