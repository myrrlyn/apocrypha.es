Ma'dran,


The recipes you sold me do not seem to hold up to what I tasted at your tents the other day. The fondues and biscuits you served me from Elsweyr were pungently sweet, and I believe caused the rumbles in my stomach later in the night. Norana and Yngold liked them well enough, though, which is the only reason I bought these Khajiiti recipes from you in the first place.



Most of these say that the sweetness comes from sugar, and yet all of the dishes I've tried have been far lacking in comparison to what you sold me. Only those lavender dumplings held up, but I believe that's because of the snowberries their recipe calls for.



If you and your other caravan traders sold me faulty foods, I'll make sure the guard hears of it! We Nords of Windhelm already keep you from our city, don't be forcing yourself out of the entire hold over some exotic food, cat!



When you get back from whatever city it is you keep going to, I expect you to tell me what you really use in your fondue and biscuits, Ma'dran!
