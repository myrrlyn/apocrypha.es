**5th Era 218**

*Chaos and desolation has spread across Tamri-El. All the souls have been lost within the plane meld Aedric slaves or the ruling children of Dread Father. But we already known this before the coming Landfall.*

*For eons we have always kill for blood and wealth for our family and harbored intense hatred for the socioties that worshiped those from the ground or high above in the cosmic stars. No more we've return, stronger then ever, grown from being a homunculus into a raging beast.*

*Form the stitch lips of the listener, we've come to learn that our Night Mother is the dark mother divine Mephala. In her infinite wisdom of secrecy and murders. Has this change our ways? Nay! We are more enlighten to the path we must walk! The path that leads all to the void!*

*No longer shall we simply kill in shadows like a band of mercenaries. We shall wage war on society itself. We shall kill, slaughter, and commit genocide on the weak! Nu-Mantia, our ritual of want is Kaos!* 

*We have reform and learned of the pathways to murder to reach the heaven that is KAOS, the sphere of SITHIS! I shall recite these words:*

**'AE HERMA MORA ALTADOON PADHOME LKHAN AE AI.'**

*Like LORKHATOSH, we must gathered the weakling slaves and bring them to their death. We shall bear our flaming swords and Anti-Cosmic might! Those who submit to the cosmic laws must be destroyed. Our world shall be a starless aeon, where the worlds unfolds and moves at every angle across the chaotic ocean.*

*To defeat NUMIDIUM and survive Landfall, is the acknowledge that it is nothing like ANU. Like how SITHIS did.*

&gt;Sithis sundered the nothing and mutated the parts, fashioning from them a myriad of possibilities. These ideas ebbed and flowed and faded away and this is how it should have been.

*We are the blade of their damnation, we are the prism who hold the forbidden light. We are the Dark Brotherhood.*
