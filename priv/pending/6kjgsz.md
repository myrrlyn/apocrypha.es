Snow elves, more commonly referred to as the Falmer, are an ancient race of Elf that existed back in the old days of the Merethic Era. In this time, according to Nordic lore, the Snow Elves and the ancient Atmorans lived together in Harmony. One day, the Snow Elves attacked the settlement of Saarthal, located near Winterhold. The Elves decimated the Nordic population during what would be called the Night of Tears. The survivors of this incident were Ysgramor and his two sons. This attack urged Ysgramor into gathering a small army of the finest Atmoran warriors, or the Five Hundred Companions.

Ysgramor and the Five Hundred Companions had waged war with the Snow Elves, and the Five Hundred ultimately won. The Elves then went to their cousins, the Dwemer, for shelter in their underground cities. The Dwemer allowed them into their cities and ultimately protected them from extinction, and in turn the Snow Elves had to give their sight. The Dwemer forced their Snow Elf cousins to eat a toxic plant that destroyed their eyesight. From then on the Dwemer enslaved the Snow Elves, and those who resisted either gave in or died. From thereon, the Snow Elves evolved into the Falmer. A war began to brew between the two races, but by the time the Falmer were ready to strike, the Dwemer were gone.

Now, to cite the titular question; will they return? It is entirely possible that the existing Snow Elves could form a new civilization for theirselves, however, it would most likely be a savage society dedicated to the eradication of the surface dwelling races. Observing Falmer behavior has concluded many times that the Falmer are excellent at the art of alchemy, and can create deadly poisons. They have also been able to fashion huts and dangerous weaponry from the Chaurus that live underground. It appears the two species have formed a bond, as man has with cattle. The Falmer offer the Chaurus complete protection and, in exchange, recieve the body of the Chaurus, which they use for weapons, meat, and ultimately, homes. Female Falmer are less in number than their male counterparts, but are not unheard of.

Another theory that I have constructed myself is that there are surviving ancient Snow Elves. While not an accepted idea by most scholars, there are others that have claimed they have seen surviving Snow Elves and ancient Snow Elven architecture. Many assume these scholars to be insane or simply begging for the adoration of their fellow pursuers of knowledge, but the claim is not as outlandish as it seems, as there are confirmed reports of buildings built presumably by the Snow Elves. If these buildings do exist, who's to say that their architects do not reside within them?
