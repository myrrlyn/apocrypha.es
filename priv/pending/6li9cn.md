In the Tongue of his primeval sky-reavers he is Kron-Jun-Duiid, the Devourer, who exiled the errant End. Among Westerners, who weft across the memory-strands with a churlish ignorance of the ills wrought upon the time-tides by their Endless Wandering, she is Empress, High Queen, Ismir. 

When the man-prey of the Tsaeci abandoned their homes it was in earnest; for fools and men of faith both strive to fulfill destiny. They chased legends of the world enders end; thus began the penultimate dragon-empire of White-Gold. 

The glorious and esteemed Nu-Man, descended from the fork-tongued ashmer, has shouted heresy at the face of the Born Hunter of Dragonkind. But this monastery remembers what both Nu-Man and Otherkin do not.

The time-shards gather to darken the skies of Dovahnor again. The Dovahsattvah, one foot atop the scaled steps, refuses the divine to teach the people. Believe, believe. The two in one claim the Warrior's heart, like the void-fathers before. Beware, beware.The Dragon Queen shuns the footprints of the Mismake Princes, Walking a new path. The Conqueror King subverts the mantle of the World-Eater, that the arena may be Preserved.

The Darkness has passed, but the legend yet grows. You'll know, you'll know, when the Dragonborn's come
