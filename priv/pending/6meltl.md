Welcome, friend. In our first volume, we cover Winterhold. Spatior could not be more pleased to visit the ancient seat of power in Skyrim. In the course of our tour, you'll see that Winterhold's ancient mysteries extend from her people to the history and architecture that make up the city itself.

We begin our journey outside the city walls, along the inhospitable mountain pass that leads all the way to Winterhold's enormous gates.

**Winterhold's Surroundings**

Before traveling alongside the icy coastline, you should be sure to take in the sights. To the west we see the great Mount Anthor. Those of you familiar with Nord legends will know it as the site of battle between Olaf One-Eye and the dragon Numinex. Today the mountain is perhaps best know as a refuge for the Dark Elves. Refugee worshippers of the Daedric Prince Azura have recently completed building an enormous statue dedicated to the goddess. Visible for miles, the statue serves as a breathtaking landmark for travelers, weather permitting.

**The Gates of Winterhold**

The entrance to Winterhold is comprised of two enormous metal gates inscribed with an unknown runic language. If Winterhold were any other city, such tall gates would have surely collapsed under the sheer weight. Not Winterhold. Her gates and walls are imbued with vast amounts of magicka, not unlike an enchanted shield. This not only provides immense stability and strength, but supposedly controls its locking mechanism. Many claim these gates are precisely why the city's defences have been impregnable for centuries. During the Oblivion Crisis, even the Daedra hordes and their terrifying siege engines were unable to break through when a great gate opened outside the city walls. This marvel of magic is all thanks to the famous College of Winterhold, which I will come back to later.

Now we pass through the gates and enter the marketplace of Winterhold.

**The Crystal District**

Once you have been granted entry through the magical gates, you can behold Winterhold in all its splendor. The city's busy marketplace is renown for offering the rarest and most obscure magical goods in Tamriel. Winterhold's inn and shops and always packed with traveling mages and scholars, and displays of magical prowess are commonplace.

What many find striking is the city's unique architecture. While basic wood and stonework is commonplace for many Nordic towns, Winterhold is ancient and its structures proudly bear the mark of ancient stonecraft. Polished grey moonstone, graceful arches and ornate metalwork are everywhere to see. What many visitors don't know is that the oldest buildings were built using a combination of Atmoran and Elven techniques.

Although many myths credit Archmage [Shalidor](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shalidor) conjuring the city in the First Era, parts of the city actually predate him. Legend holds that during Ysgramor's conquest of Skyrim, he didn't just wipe out the native Snow Elves and raze their cities. He enslaved many and used them to build the founding cities of Skyrim. Although Windhelm, Ragnvald and Bromjunaar were built in the traditional Atmoran fashion, Winterhold was not. Elven artisans taught the Atmoran stonemasons their secrets, which in turn birthed a new form of architecture unique only to Winterhold. The most prominent structure in this style is, of course, the College of Winterhold itself.

**College of Winterhold**

Led by [Archmage Deneth](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:On_the_Great_Collapse), the college is arguably the most revered institute of magical study in Tamriel, and a without doubt the focal point of this great city (much to Jarl Valdimar's chagrin). From the market, we'll travel up the ramp and across the great bridge into the college courtyard. At the center stands an imposing statue of Shalidor himself, the founder and first Archmage of the college. Prior to Shalidor, the building had served various roles throughout history. When [King Borgas](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Borgas) took the throne, he granted his old friend and personal battlemage unlimited resources to establish and expand the college. Since then its role has vastly grown in scope. Not only does it stand as a shining beacon of magical learning and research, but is integral part of running many of the city's utilities and services. 

A century ago, the College became home to the Ysmir Collective, an ancient Atmoran library rescued from destruction during the Arnesian War in Morrowind. It became the cornerstone of academic life at the college, and scholars from all over Tamriel descended on Winterhold to study its contents in the college's vast Arcanaeum. If you're lucky, you may even catch a glimpse of the numerous Psijiic monks and advisors that currently reside in within its walls.

**The Hsaarik District**

As we make out way back over the bridge, stop to enjoy one of the best views of the city below - the sprawling Hsaarik residential district that surrounds the college. After the tragic events of the Red Year almost a century ago, Jarl Martok graciously granted thousands of Dark Elves refuge in the city - particularly those who could contribute to the College's studies. Although Winterhold has always been a relatively cosmopolitan city, the recent influx of refugees resulted in a renaissance. Culture, art and magic flourished in the years that followed.

As we stroll down the spacious streets of Hsaarik, flanked by towering stone houses, take solace in the fact that crime is almost non-existent here. An incredible feat indeed! Thanks to college magicks, the city is patrolled and guarded by countless iron golems. These constructs are found throughout the city and maintain order at all costs (and admittedly take some getting used to) but law-abiding visitors need not be alarmed.

**Vrage's Keep**

If we look far to the north of the city, we can see the imposing Vrage's Keep. Built on the cliff edge of Hsaarik's Head, it overlooks the Sea of Ghosts. Historically, it has served as the palace of the High King dating back to [King Vrage](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vrage), the first monarch to rule from Winterhold. Although Skyrim's capital was traditionally Windhelm (as decreed by Ysgramor and his successors) King Vrage moved the capital to Winterhold after his ascension to the throne in 1E 222. It was from here he initiated the Skyrim Conquests, and claimed swaths of land across Morrowind and High Rock. When the capital city moved to Whiterun under Olaf One-Eye, and then later to Solitude, Vrage's Keep remained in use as the Jarl's residence. Unfortunately, the new Jarl has banned visitors from the keep's grounds, so don't expect a friendly welcome if you venture all the way out here.

**Star-Gazer Observatory**

To the eastern cliff edge we find the home of astronomical study in Skyrim. The city's relatively new observatory is the envy of many nations and well worth taking a look inside. Constructed and administered by [Star-Gazer](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Star-Gazers) refugees fleeing Belkarth's sacking in the Third Era, it has aided the college greatly in its research into the Void Nights phenomenon. If you get the chance, be sure to also visit their gift shop... the telescopes are unparalleled in quality.

In closing, I cannot recommend visiting this marvelous city enough. Winterhold has flourished under the guidance and protection of the College mages, becoming a prominent center of civilization in the northern wilderness of Skyrim. Long may she stand!

That's all for Walking the World Volume I. Spatior does not know his next destination yet, but you can be sure that where he does go he will leave you a record of the best things to see.
