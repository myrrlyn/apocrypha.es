Eight months after I posted the original UM Bible, the Uutak Mythos has grown a bit larger than it has ever before. We now have an UESP page, more official artwork, are beginning to work on updating the TvTropes article about the Mythos, and will soon be having an official addendum added to the Unofficial Elder Scrolls TTRPG! To celebrate, I have gathered and re-updated a bunch of interesting Uutak fiction I have written over the years into one document as a supplementary for the UM Bible. I hope you all enjoy these texts, and I will begin to work on more fun Uutak Mythos things in the future. Enjoy your ovaltine!

Sincerely,

P.S. You may download this file in any format that you see fit, and it comes to around 120 pages.
