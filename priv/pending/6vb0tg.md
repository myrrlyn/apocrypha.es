From the ruins of Sheogorad he came. Sul-Zethulah. The first natural born Chimer in an aeon. Shoeless and dressed in rags but with the Star of Azura fixed upon his brow and in its center was carved a Golden Eye. 

They came to him. 

First, the Velothi Ashlanders who had dreamed of his arrival. 

Then the poor and the downtrodden who knew only the heel upon their neck. 

Then the young of the House who still had the fire of change burning in their hearts. 

And he preached to them the words of the Great Hortator. Our Ruling King who had been shattered in three during a Red Moment but had been reassembled and made whole during a Red Year. 

He read to them aloud the words from the Book of Ruling Kings. The sacred tome written by the Hortator's closest apostles, Alandro the Guardian and Voryn the Counselor, during the founding of Resdaynia.

When he had finished a small child had once asked "Ashkhan Sul, why do you not wear shoes?" 

And the Ashkhan had replied that he had walked far. From the frozen west where the refugees still remain all the way to the sacred east where the Emperor Parasol forests grow. And from the sunken swamps of the south were Great House Lukiul hold sway to the furthest northern coast where he removed his footwear and cast them into the still waters of the Sea of Ghosts. For it was at that moment he knew this land, wounded by a Star and healed by a Moon, was truly sacred. 

And thus was the Church of the Nerevarii built.

The ending of the words is HORTATOR.
