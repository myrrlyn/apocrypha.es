((Written for Beyond Skyrim and Tamriel Rebuilt. Taken from official lore with some of my own ponderings.))

You want to know more about the Khajiit furstocks? This one explains.

The Senche is one of the most famous of furstocks, but for all the wrong reasons. Outlanders often get this one confused, this one thinks, because Senche very common term in Ta’agra. But THE Senche, yes, the Senche that are the furstocks? They are famous for their own reasons.

The Senche are very tall. They were once the size and shape of the great sabercats of Skyrim, this one hears, but they did not want to be confused for those Rhojiit without any mind. So they stretched their heads and their forelegs up and up, until they are as they are today: with their fores twice as long as their hinds. This Khajiit hears outlanders comparing them to hyenas in looks, but Khajiit wouldn’t know. Khajiit thought hyenas were Redguard dogs, not at all like noble Khajiit.

But Senche are just the right size for riding this way. They do much work on all fours, pulling our wagons, running couriers back and forth across the great deserts. They are better than the Pahmar-Raht at this, for they have small thumbs on their forepads, yes? And though they prefer to merely run on them, they are handsy enough to carry the firewood or tie a bandage if their rider gets hurt. 

Very loyal Senche are to their rider, their blood-brother or -sister, but only to one. Many think Senche dim and subservient like dog, and Senche know this, keep to themselves and are grumpy with outsiders. Very rare outside our Elsweyr they are, which is why this one thinks outlanders always confuse them for senche-cats. Silly outlanders; they don’t know what they miss, not having the loyalty of a good steady Senche-Khajiit!
