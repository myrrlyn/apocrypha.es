This document contains selected memospores sent between the crew of *Ascension*, the first Altmeri Sunbird sent through the expanse of the Void towards the sun, in order to reach Aetherius, and their contact back on Nirn, in Alinor.

Inspired by roleplay on r/nirnpowers

*Alinor, this is Ascension.*    

*We have a stable upward trajectory, and are expecting to reach the liminal barriers soon. Already some turbulence, but nothing we can’t manage. We'll contact you on the other side.*    

*Carondil*

*Alinor, this is Ascension.*    

*We have passed through, leaving Nirn behind. The transition was rough, but any inflicted damage was minimal. Onelo is going over diagnostics, will be sending data soon. Once we receive confirmation that Ascension is fully operational, we will proceed with the mission.*

*Alinor, this is Ascension.*    

*Thank the gods for Mirror Logic. Tunarwae is great at her job. She is maintaining the normalcy field over the entire ship. No negative effects have come up.*    

*Nirn is beautiful from up here. It even curves, as it was theorized to appear. Onelo will send additional data.*    

*We will proceed with the mission. Infinity Localization Drive ready.*

*Alinor, this is Ascension.*    

*There is a problem. I have not been able to contain my normalcy field over the entire Sunbird. This far into the Void the Argument of Mortal Displacement holds more logic than expected. Crew members have fallen unconscious. To my understanding, they stopped breathing and are air deprived.*    

*Should I cancel the mission? I have not been briefed about using this Infinity Localization Drive, so you have to walk me through it.*    

*Tunarwae.*

*Ascension, this is Alinor.*    

*We advise against trying to control the vessel. Its trajectory was delicately calculated. Your only chance is to focus your normalcy field on individuals at a time, and to try teaching them to contain their mortality through their own will.*    

*We have contacted the Institute of Mirror Logic. They will be sending you detailed information you can use when inducting the crew, so your focus is not compromised.*    
*Good luck.*

*Alinor, this is Ascension.*    

*I can't describe what happened to us. This place does not want us here. It's hard to learn how to resist the attempts of Oblivion to take a hold over your mind.*    

*I can mostly manage myself now, as do the others, with struggles. Some still keep fainting. I have set the lights on the screens to flash every minute, to remind us to take breaths regularly. We all re-learned why and how to breathe, but actually doing it regularly is still difficult.*    

*Tunarwae needs rest, but I am not sure when we will be able to let her. We are still vulnerable without her normalcy field. She claims that her potions will fend off exhaustion indefinitely, but I am beginning to doubt it.*    

*We are all tired, weak and on edge, but we're pushing forward. If anything changes, we'll let you know.*    

*Carondil.*

*Don't forget to eat and drink. When you feel confident, make sure you sleep as well.*    

*Tell Tunarwae she will get a raise.*

*Alinor, this is Ascension.*    

*All the same today. Measurements indicate that we are getting close. Magnus is getting quite big in our view.*    

*Some new interesting data have been recorded. Onelo will send his analysis, as usual.*

*It's been a month today. Somehow, we are still us. We could have suffocated on day one, but we didn't. We are pushing through, as always.*

*Alinor, this is Ascension.*    

*Infinity Localization Drive disengaged. Wards were powered up and put in place. We are aiming at the edge of Magnus at a calculated angle, per your recommendation. Data will be sent every hour, or if anything changes.*    

*We can already feel the magicka. It's so pure, and much more unyielding than I imagined.*    

*We are bracing for entry.*

*Alinor, this is Ascension.*    

*We barely budged. The torrent of magicka is halting our advance. Your calculations for the increased energy supply to the propulsion system haven't led anywhere. We almost blew up the core.*    

*The wards are holding up so far, but their energy requirements are rising the further we go. If I were sane, I would abandon the mission much sooner, but all data indicates that we are now past the point of no return. If we turn the ship around, we will be torn apart.*    

*Onelo is sending the data. He keeps telling me how fascinating it is, but I'm too busy trying to keep us alive.*    

*We are pushing through, as always.*    

*Pray for us, Alinor. Even if we are physically closer to the gods than you are, pray for us. We need any help we can get.*    

*Carondil.*
