You want to know more about the furstocks? This one explains.

The Pahmar-Raht is one of the most fearsome and large of all Khajiit. Many an outlander describe them as giant tigers, and this one would agree! As large as a High Rock horse and liking to eat half of one in a single sitting, they are.

The Pahmar-Raht are not given to civilized manner and civilized talk like this one. They prefer the wild life on the outskirts of the villages, the hunting and the fishing, Sometimes one can persuade a Pahmar-Raht to come in out of the heat and grit and be a good guards-beast, yes, paid for in pinches of moonsugar. Otherwise they would be obliged to chew the cane in their back teeth like a sow, and this one is told that will dull the fangs something fierce. She has never tried it herself, of course.

But this one warns! Such hiring is best done after Pahmar-Raht have grown up a little. Pahmar-Raht are ravenous as little kits, you see, and grow to their full heights so quickly! Against Khajiit law to employ them before they fill in their haunches to match their heights, for Pahmar-Raht are always thinking they’re bigger than they are, especially when young. Get their masters into trouble, and gets themselves hurt. Bad for business, that is.

Inevitable, too, that some outlanders like you then ask: why not ride the Pahmar-Raht into battle? They are strong as lions and have claws and teeth to boot, after all. Ah, but this one says, they are bloodthirsty and given to the beast’s instincts. Not liking to listen to other Khajiit, the Pahmar-Raht. Having their own agenda, their own masters in their heads. 

Nor are their spines comfortable on this one’s crotch, no! No saddle made for a horse will fit a Pahmar-Raht’s long back. It bunches up and falls away without warning when they leap, and this one needs more than just a horseman’s knees to hold on. Pahmar-Raht, they get impatient with this one's falls, so this one just prefers to put her own boots to the task, and let the Pahmar-Raht be Pahmar-Raht.
