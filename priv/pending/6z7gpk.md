__________________________________________________

We walk though the ash and stone

searching, searching for the bone

the symbol of our ancestral might

the proof of our ruling right

Through haunted tombs and caves

we hope to find our holy naves

where bones have been burnt to ash

our servants dig under our lash

We bring it all to the Unbroken Home

and read from Dagoth's holy tome

MORNAGAIA, GORIANDA, RACUVAR

shape and form with your BAUNEPAR

A base of hardened ash will do

when we shape our ancestors anew

make it tall, make it wide, make it strong

we have all waited for this so very long

Give it a fine robe of Mountain red

give it holes, mouths to keep it fed

give it eyes, the colour of blackest night

soon the statue will be quite a sight

Perform the ritual, and our lord will come

he will bless the statues, but only some

only those who were part of his cause

may be an ingredient in our soul-sauce

When all of this is finished and done

you must bring it to a descended son

one of House Dagoth, they will know it

then they shall willingly in our circle sit
