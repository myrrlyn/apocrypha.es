((Suthay-Raht were the player race for the game Morrowind.))

You want to know more about the furstocks? This one explains.

The Suthay-Raht, you ask? They are the most equal between man and beast, with the hands, forehead and jaws of a man, but the tail, legs and fur of a cat. They dance the Riddle-Thar dance in their forms the best of all Khajiit, and some are used as representatives of Elsweyr communities with many furstocks for this reason. 

Some Khajiit tell you furstock does not make a difference, but these Khajiit listening too much to Imperial propaganda to know the true words. You see, it does not bother Khajiit in the same way it bothers you outlanders, that Khajiit all look different and act the same. For we are not foolish, and know that some furstocks do things better or worse because of their forms. It is part of the dance, to learn to put this shell of flesh to best use, not a hindering or a sign a Khajiit is less than any other.

It was a hard lesson, the time we learned outlanders do not think this way. Many moon-turns ago, when Khajiit still new at walking this wheel, the Khajiit meet the dark elves of Resdaynia. Khajiit send them their Suthay-Raht to talk and explain Khajiit ways, but dark elves not listen, see only a beast standing upright. Now that is why Suthay-Raht are common in Morrowind. Now that is why they are in chains. Now that is why Suthay-Raht all stay at home, and leave the adventuring in other provinces to the Cathay.
