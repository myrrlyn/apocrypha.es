*[The transcript of the death talk of the chief ordinator Dranedabal Sarim-Hinata, the leader of the ordinators, concerning the tribunal gods.]*

A few Dunmer have ever read the sermons of Lord Vivec. And even less have truly understood them. They see the obscure images of ALMSIVI on shrines, as statues, or in written traditions, and choose to worship them. Not because ALMSIVI would be worth it, but because everyone worships ALMSIVI.

Through this social pressure it is no longer necessary to understand ALMSIVI to worship ALMSIVI. For most of the Dunmer they are only three individuals with unimaginable power who together rule a land, but ALMSIVI is so much more!

ALMSIVI are not three individuals. ALMSIVI means individual. It is a unit that can exist simultaneously in three places. Have you ever been in a Kwama-mine? If you attack a skrib there without any kwama noticed it, all Kwama will attack you. Each Kwama's eye is the eye of Kwama. Kwama is an individual, a unity. And so it is with ALMSIVI but ALMSIVI is the unity of the Dunmer.

I had the incredible fortune to be able to speak with each part of ALMSIVI and I quickly realized that ALMSIVI is Morrowind. The government.

A successful government has knowledge of this world and power of this world and every aspect of ALMSIVI represents one of these aspects.

ALMSIVI is like the law. Lord Sil is the judge who decide the judgment. Lady Almalexia is the executioner who makes the judgment, and Lord Vivec writes a story about it and revives the convicted in his fiction.

Almalexia is the graceful law of our people. She is the power of this world. Under her command are the high-ordinators, the strongest military force in Morrowind. No other aspect of ALMSIVI had ever the desire to create such a force, except the ALM. She protects us and our country.

Every cross-border war with involved dunmer has started by her, i tell you that. If she is the judge, the judgment is always the hardest. If she is the executioner, the punishment is always the most brutal. She is not only our protector, she is also a deterrent to all who want to harm our people.

When ALMSIVI fought back Dagon in Gramfeste, the ALM in ALMSIVI was the strongest Apsekt. It was ALMsivi who fought against the prince of the deadlands.

Sotha Sil is the exact opposite of our Lady. He is the knowledge of Dunmer and the judge of this world. He sees the freedom of the world in the power of knowledge. His principle is “Knowledge replaces science.[1] “ If every question can be answered, there are no more problems. Even a war is nothing more than an escalating question for justice, resources, or freedom.

Lord Sil is by far the most intelligent of the tribunes. His knowledge of this world is boundless. [2]

During the great war against Cyrodiil, the armistice contract was signed, and Vivec was not involved in the negotiations, as is often told, but almSIvi, who had recognized the advantages of peace.

And finally, Lord/Lady Vivec. I, as an honored and blessed Ordinator, should be depressed by the fact that I have learned to hate him more and more, the more I met him, and the longer I spoke to her. He and she is not bounded to the knowledge or power of a country. Neither order nor justice. Maybe he is the culture.

While ALMsivi is leading war, Vivec is holding talks. And when almSIvi seeks and spread knowledge, Vivec spreads fiction. He/She is the most ovscure of all tribunes and perhaps the most hazardous part of ALMSIVI. Whenever I had to protect the entire tribunal, I was ready to stop the delusion of Lord-Lady Vivec, with my blade if necessary.
Since Lord-Lady Vivec is the culture, it can be said that ALMSIVI did not form the culture of the dunmer, but almsiVI did. Every -Drunk-Rhyme, every poem, and history of a darker origin can be traced back sooner or later to the Lady-Lord of poetry and betrayal.

It seemed to me as if the he-she had been disgusted by this world. He-She did not try to be the power of the world, or the knowledge of the World. It was in search of a new world.
