he first thing you should know is that, in all their wonder, the dragons too are pilgrims like us. They too must meditate deeply on the Way, the words, and they too are capable of falling, and when they fall it can be terrible indeed.

Also like us is their diversity of roles that they hold among our ranks. There are elders and catechists; peacekeepers and guardians; messengers and missionaries.

Being companions in this journey, therefore, we must not stray into the error of worshipping any of them, such as the Dragon Cultists of long ago, or, more recently, the Nuv-Akatoshians, who claimed our good leader was the form of Akatosh Himself.

For many of our generations it was that our Order was extremely small. There was but the Grandmaster and the smallest number of men following the Way. It was not until the return of the dragons that our ranks grew so wide. You see, the dragons need human fellowship on this journey most of all. With no humans holding the blessed power to combat a guardian abondoning his path, he might be tempted to succumb to his baser instincts of conquest. But with enough mortals to resist a dragon may take pause to subvert those inclinations. Rather, they may learn virtues of pedagogy, leadership, and come to appreciate the respect, admiration, even friendship, of mortal beings.

You too, will have the chance to develop such bonds with these majestic creatures. For now, you have yet to learn your first word! Stay persitent in your meditations on the Way, and patiently take the guidance of your instructors. In time you will have the chance to speak face to face with one of the instinctive masters of the Thu'um. 

Should you decide to continue more deeply along this path in full dedication or instead take a more earthly road in the Way, it will be a true joy to us all. Though there is one Way, there are many lines; one song, but many voices.

Being part of this chorus, you will be taught a role in the Last Hymn of the Age. Each has something to contribute to the Hymn, big or small, and our individual training includes it accordingly. Only the Grandmaster knows the full Hymn; when the end of the age has come he will announce himself with the Thu'um and let out the Final Antiphon. Then we will all gather together, raising our voices fully ready for what happens at the close.

Drem nau hin zii, werid wah Kaan ahrk kogaan wah Paarthurnax,
Peace upon your spirit, praise to Kyne and thanks to Paarthurnax
