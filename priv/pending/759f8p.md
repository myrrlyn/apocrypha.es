It is time, my friends. After more than 4 months of writing and several Weeks of translating it is done! The first German C0DA with **150+ Pages, 50k Words and 326k Characters.** It is more extensive than the Ur-C0DA byMichael Kirkbride with its 51 Pages, 11k Words and 65k Characters!

Some infos for you. It is the first of the planned parts. I REALY don't know when Part 2 will be finished. It is not even plotted yet, because my Job needs a lot of time and worse: I am a professional (German) Authro so even if i had free-time after Writing, it is ofte totaly unmotivational to use your free-time of Writing to ...write. So it may come never, maybe in a few years. Don't know. But i love the C0DA-Universe i created and i will post Apocryphas about the Universe soon.

The Work is a few years old. Within these years i published a original Novel, so this Work is not the perfect example for my writing-skills. You can read the C0DA right here. I know my english sucks and i fixed some errors from the psoted-Version, and i hope you will have fun still!
