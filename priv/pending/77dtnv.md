The city of Daggerfall in southwestern Glenumbra was founded by Nords during the early years of the fifth century of the first era. The city's port was very active and was an important trading post in the Nordic empire for the next hundred years or so. Despite this history being well known the reason for it's name are now forgotten. 

Most theories seem to be based off the naming of Hammerfell. The Breton story us that a Nord threw his dagger on the ground either to mark a border or to claim the land. Although this is a nice story, like all Breton stories it is wrong. Daggerfall was founded by the Nord, Hjollmor Dagger-Fall. How Hjollmor got the name Dagger-Fall is a topic of great debate in his hometown Morthal. One story says he was a clumsy man and would often drop his weapon, the other states that as a young boy he fell on a dagger and was scarred by the incident.

Regardless of how he got his name, the important bit is that he was a young Nord living in Morthal during the first era. The life of the Nords of Hjallmarch has always been tough and eventually Hjollmor became sick of scraping a living in the marsh and along with several other young Nords set off to find a better life elsewhere. The Nordic empire had already expanded into modern High Rock and Hjollmor hoped to find a suitable home in these newly conquered lands to the west. Sailing from Solitude he and his crew had hoped to settle in northern Rivenspire where the town of Northpoint had recently been established. However a fierce storm blew then far west of their intended destination and so they established a town at the natural harbour they discovered. Despite troubles with local elves and proto-Bretons, the town began to flourish and is now one of Tamriel's greatest cities. The great port of Daggerfall was one of the many jewels in the crown of the Nordic Empire. Without Hjollmor Dagger-Fall there would be no great city in southern Glenumbra and for his great deeds the city still bears his name to this day. That is how Daggerfall got it's name regardless of what the Bretons or the knife-ears say.
