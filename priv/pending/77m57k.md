This is a thorough rewrite and very much expanded upon essay explaining the importance of the metaphysical Hero/Prisoner archetype in the Elder Scrolls. It was too long to post directly to /r/teslore, as it is 54 pages and contains multiple images, so I made a .PDF. I hope you all enjoy it, and I'll try to comment if you have any questions or criticism. Drink your Ovaltine. - IFW
