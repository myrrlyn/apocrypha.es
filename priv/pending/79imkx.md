 -Hail to you Lord of Wayfarers, 


We write to you again as we have before, as we did your predecessors. We seek to right an error. The name of our realms is mistaken within your accounts; You dub our lands "Roscrea", this is untrue and unfortunate. Your High King sailed into a now defunct roskrs-eha, a sewage river of the town of Juvik, Agwo Constituency. One that has long since been dredged and its outlet made into the Stainavaris polder. We remind you Wayfarers' Guild, that our realm is Zanderlensar, and that Zanderlensar is 3 constituent islets, Agwo, Heltis, and Ji. We ask that you change our Imperial designation to Zanderlensar, or to some Kyrodisk variant thereof. Were you us, would you wish to live in 'Shit-Water'?
