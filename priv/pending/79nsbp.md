For Imperial colonists, it’s called “Bloody Sundas”. The native altmer have varying names for the event, from “The Exsanguination” to “The Last Laugh”. 

Exactly 6 days after the signing of The Crystal Concordat, the treaty that resulted in the annexation of Summerset, Battlereeves began to gather around Imperial forts and construction sites on the backs of welwa, particularly the Imperial fortress-capital of [Sunmoth City](http://hybridtechcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/palmanova_03.jpg). Others were barging their way into the offices of high ranking administrators, flinging aside all who stood in their way with a telekinetic glare.

Few natives placed blame on the Battlereeves for losing the war. Septim had cheated. He didn’t even give them a chance to discuss terms before the Aurbis shattered around them. 

The Battlereeves didn’t care. They failed. There was only one way to maintain their Sacred Honor. There were exactly 1001 [Battlereeves](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/5e/26/28/5e262815fc528e604cc167e774668901.jpg) in total, some dating back to the Late Alessian period. This would not remain so.

After minutes of silence, and a tense stare-down, it began. 

When the knives came out, the Imperials thought they were under attack. They were not.

In some sort of twisted synchronization, these ancient warlords slit their wrists, their throats, some simply gushed blood from every orifice. In all cases, they made sure to vandalize Imperial property, or Imperial officers, with their blood. With a grim smirk, they fell to their knees, and then to the ground. 

Within 6 minutes, it was over. But it was not the end.

Soon after the event, the Imperials realized the blood wouldn’t wash out. Not from the walls, not from their clothes, not from their skin. Sploches of blood stained the various forts and offices of the new Imperial government. Officials were disfigured for the rest of their lives. To this day, the grass grows red around Sunmoth City.

[In their own sick way, the Battlereeves had marked their people’s territory.](https://www.pandotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Red-Seabeach-Panjin-China-3.jpg) 

Today, altmer celebrate this event, while Imperial colonists try their best to ignore it. Even those altmer loyal to the empire look back on this day with morbid affection. On this day, young mer are known to splash red dye on any outlanders they meet, hopefully casting a recall or chameleon spell before they’re caught. On this day, everyone remembers that the altmer had The Last Laugh.
