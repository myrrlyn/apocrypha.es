[[Part one of my altmer society posts can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/79ja5m/the_political_situation_of_the_summerset_isles_in/). This is a continuation of my mostly altmer-centric lore stuff based on Tamriel Rebuilt, The "old" lore, and some of the cooler stuff from ESO. The core of this post is ripped from PGE3, and a bit of ESO. I simply expanded upon the details so it could make some semblance of sense. I should note that I made most of these last few posts within hours of each other, and I've been trying to trickle them out slowly rather than just spam the sub with them. I hope you enjoy.]

Altmer hierarchy can often be confusing to outsiders, particularly those raised in Breton or Imperial courts. The idea of teachers and artists outranking the aristocracy is incomprehensible to many. To better understand this phenomenon, we must understand that the Altmer hierarchy, despite its labyrinthian complexity, is ultimately driven by a pragmatic meritocracy. The values and priorities of the altmer are illustrated through their caste system. Political power is just a single aspect of their social and spiritual lives.

**"Sparks" And Noble Legitimacy**

A mer gains legitimacy through the deeds of her ancestors. She maintains legitimacy through her own deeds. Altmer see their physical forms as vessels for a divine Spark. This Spark is the last living remnant of their ancestors: the Aedra. It is infinite and omnipresent, and each generation is linked to this same Spark. As generations go by, the Spark grows dimmer, but ultimately never dies. In the upper castes, the Spark is brighter, and this is proven through their deeds in life. As a result, the Altmer place little distinction between the deeds of an ancestor and the deeds of an individual. In a sense, the Altmer believe they *are* their ancestors. The shadow of Auri-El walks among them in the form of Kinlords. An echo of Syrabane lives within the Sorcerer-Kings. Battlereeves are avatars of Fallen-Trinimac, and Xarxes continues to chronicle their achievements through accountants and bureaucrats. With this in mind, the concept of Altmer meritocracy begins to make sense.

The basic hierarchy of the Altmer can be summed up as follows:

**The Wise**
------------

Altmer value knowledge above all things, but they're prone to keeping secrets. Secrets give you power over your rivals, and anyone selfless enough, or confident enough, to share their secrets should be revered. The Wise are those wizards and scholars who choose to share their knowledge with the people. Led by the Sapiarchs, unfathomably ancient and learned mer from eons past, The Wise are priests who worship knowledge itself. The youngest among them spend their days meditating, studying beneath their aged masters. Once initiated into the order, they travel the land, spreading knowledge and understanding to the remote corners of Summerset.

The Wise, more than any other faction, believe in the dream of a United Aldmer People. They understand the need for tongs and Kinships, but believe knowledge can unite the disparate tribes of mer. As such, they've been known to travel to distant Valenwood to educate the bosmeri tribes. Once, they would travel as far as Skyrim and High Rock, to spread their knowledge to the falmer and the direnni, but the cancer of Man has consumed these lands, and The Wise cannot risk their knowledge falling into the hands of animals. The Wise were never welcomed in Resdayn, and The Wise view the Dunmer with both sympathy and disgust.

The Sapiarchs restrict themselves to the highest and lowest levels of Crystal-Like-Law, in chambers displaced by time and space. Few have ever seen them, and some believe they've transcended beyond their mortal forms. They should not be confused for reclusive hermits, however. They are constantly transmitting information to their students, in the form of hallucinogenic, psychedelic visions. Though they speak no coherent words, they have personalities, desires, and even a sense of humor, and their students grow to see them as eldritch parental figures. It is the duty of the Wisemer to translate their messages, and to record them within tomes and data-gems. As a rule of thumb, The Wise do not hide their knowledge from the people, but the words of the Sapiarchs are often too powerful and dangerous to openly share, and must be contained.

**[The Artists](https://gss0.baidu.com/7Po3dSag_xI4khGko9WTAnF6hhy/zhidao/pic/item/f9dcd100baa1cd1195469294b012c8fcc2ce2d96.jpg)**
------------

Part socialite, part god-hero, the Artists of Summerset are objects of near-mythical awe and reverence. To dream, to create, to bring joy is to grow closer to the Aedra themselves. Altmer who dedicate themselves to High Art hone their craft for at least a century, often in glitter-induced dream-states. They do not release their first work to the public until they believe it is worthy. This work of art will forever define them, and they spend countless decades working to perfect it.

To call them eccentric would be an understatement. Many speak entirely in poetry, their voices resonating within the body of the listener, granting them deep, almost sexual pleasure. Others have sculpted their flesh into objects of incomprehensible beauty, their forms shining blurs upon the eye of the uninitiated. Others still are brilliant engineers, creating golems, statues, and buildings based on Sacred Geometry.

Despite their lofty reputations, they are prone to gossip, pranks, drinking, and scandal. Essentially, they're the celebrities of the Summerset Isles.

A ravenous cult of personality surrounds the Artists. Varline-transmissions are full of rumor and innuendo concerning these godlike figures. Whose feuding with whom? Who slept with whom? These tales spark the imagination of the Altmeri small-folk, and form the basis of heated debate in local cantinas.

**[The Kinlords](http://78.media.tumblr.com/042d8e9b3578decbb2e386354a4182b6/tumblr_ohszi6ETWy1rml4zno1_540.jpg)**
----------

As discussed in the previous post, Kinlords are the parental lords of the Altmer. It may seem strange to see them so low in the Altmer hierarchy, but they are feared and beloved nonetheless.  In terms of practical, legal, familial, and political power, the Kinlords reign supreme. But politics are just a single aspect of the complex, kaleidoscopic social constructs that comprise Altmer society.

A Kinlord's most trusted servants are his Canonreeves, as well as his personal Vicereeve. Canonreeves are bureaucratic administrators assigned by a Kinlord as mayors or diplomats. The vast majority of Summerset communities are managed by the local Canonreeve, and they are often sent as ambassadors to Alinor or Imperial territory. A Vicereeve is the right-hand-mer of any high-ranking Altmer. The most powerful Viecreeves serve the Kinlords as chancellors. They are utterly committed to their lord, and handle the day to day affairs of the Kinhold. The word of a Vicereeve is considered the word of the Kinlord himself, and they wield considerable power in their master's name.

**[Battlereeves](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5e/26/28/5e262815fc528e604cc167e774668901--warrior-queen-woman-warrior.jpg)**
-----------

Altmer are not generally known for their prowess in battle, but this is because few have met a battlereeve and lived to tell the tale. Any soldier whose served his kin for over 400 years is considered a battlereeve. These ancient warriors blend spell with sword, and have honed their death-craft to a razor's edge. They are single-minded, viciously dedicated to the defense of their people. In general, they spend their days meditating, exercising, and patrolling the borders of the lands they protect. While a rare few may be amiable, or even friendly, they are constantly assessing threats and analyzing battle tactics. They haven't lived this long by accident. In general, they are a grim, morbid lot. If they have a sense of humor, it is violent and dry.

To face a Battlereeve is to face death. Their adamantium face-masks are both elegant and terrifying, meant to symbolize the forbidden thought-forms of entropy and death, associated with the dread Sithis. Their blades are made of glass or meteoric iron, capable of turning a maormer into a slurry of gore within seconds. Thankfully for the Empire, battlereeves are exceedingly rare. Most Altmer dedicate their lives to less violent pursuits, and those who take up arms do so only out of necessity. [The vast majority of battlereeves committed suicide shortly after The Occupation began](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/79nsbp/an_analysis_of_summersets_bloody_sundas_tamriel/), and at present number less than a hundred. Still, it's worth noting that every Battlereeve was alive when their land was taken from them. This failure is their greatest shame, and the source of their deep-seeded rage.

These warlords often control entire regions in the name of their Kinlord. These lands are highly militarized and strictly regimented, centered around a monastic fortress dedicated to Trinimac. The people have curfews and schedules, and crime is nonexistent. These warlords have little time for politics, wandering the remote corners and borders of the lands they protect. They prefer to isolate themselves from their kin, seeing themselves as grim tools of death, a force of nature their people should never have to face. Their most trusted and zealous servants run the day to day affairs of their fiefs, and they remain in touch with their Battlereeve via Varline or Memospore. The Battlereeves look upon their subjects with both love and suspicion, and are willing to die a thousand deaths to protect them.

**Landowners**
---------

The landed gentry are the upper-class kinfolk of the Altmer. They live in small but elegant estates on the land they own, or within the penthouse suites of urban skyscrapers. This is the highest position an Altmer can realistically aspire to achieve.

In order to earn any respect, a landowner must have a trade. The Altmer do not tolerate their aristocracy to grow fat and lazy. Their legitimacy comes from what they can provide for their kin. They are rich because they deserve to be. They are respected and feared because they are Honorable. As such, their land is always dedicated to an industry that directly benefits their Kin, be it fishing, mining, or farming. The landowners themselves are not expected to work the fields, but they must manage the funds and ensure the safety of their workers. It's at this stage and above that the altmer caste system becomes particularly dangerous. Kinships are always plotting to bring shame to their rivals, and sabotaging a landowning clan is a common tactic. Spies are ever-present, looking to find or fabricate evidence of dishonor. To assassinate another landowner is Honorable and in some cases Expected, either in secret or during house wars. To cause the Ousting of another landowner is the greatest prize of all.

The landowning aristocracy is further divided into 3 castes. The lowest are the "**common**" landowners. Often first-generation, these mer earned their land through a particularly Honorable deed. They are often ambitious and expansionistic in their economic dealings, understanding little of high politics and coming into conflict with their superiors and one another.

Next come the **Exultants**. The vast majority of these mer come from long lines of landowners. They are cautious, measured, and generally fair in their dealings, but follow strict codes of conduct that conflict with modern political realities. Most Vicereeves and Canonreeves come from Exultant families.

A step below the Kinlords are the **Optimates**. These mer have gone above and beyond their duties, and have showered their Workers with wealth and well-being. No mer can be born an Optimate. It is a title to be earned through deeds in life. In this sense, it is a "temporary" position, in that it only lasts one life, and must be earned again by your Spark in the next. The close relatives of Optimates automatically gain the title of Exultant. Optimates are granted massive swathes of land by their Kinlords, and advise their lords in political matters.

**Merchants**
----------

These entrepreneurial mer begin as workers who master a particular trade-craft. They could be particularly skilled smiths, prolific and creative enchanters, or successful accountants. Some of these Workers remain set in their ways, and live the rest of their days as passionate laborers. Others turn their minds to business.

Often, they take on apprentices and hire employees. As their revenue increases, they soon need space for a workshop or office. They'll often move near the cities, where they lease a small piece of land from the local lord. Before long, they're running a successful business, peddling their wares to the far corners of Summerset and beyond. They organize into trade unions known as tongs, which do their best to monopolize certain industries. These tongs often transcend the boundaries of the Kinship, raising suspicion from the higher castes.

The lines between the Merchants and the Workers are often blurred, and Merchants can be seen as leaders among the Workers. An increasing number of Altmer work directly for a merchant, as opposed to a landowner. Recently, a few Merchants have grown richer than the landowners themselves. This has led to a great deal of confusion and turmoil within the courts of Summerset, as many fear the natural order of things will collapse under the increasing influence of the Merchants.

**[Workers](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/48/ec/2d/48ec2d9c0233c6837ce2cad59ac8c55a--high-elf-pnp.jpg)**
----------

The (not so) humble small-folk of the Altmer. Fishermer, clerks, and low-ranking bureaucrats, the workers form the vast majority of Altmer, and are considered the lowest rung of their society. They are not viewed with contempt, however. In most cases, they are seen as children by the upper castes, quaint "young" mer seeking their guidance and wisdom. This condescension grates on the nerves of the Workers, but most know their place in the scheme of things. At the same time, they are committed to proving themselves, of attaining any scrap of Honor by emulating the upper castes.

In theory, they exist in a paradise, but in practice, many are deeply unhappy. They distract themselves with varline-transmissions, tabloids, and material-goods, but many feel a gnawing, restless void within them. Their basic needs are met, but they yearn for self-actualization. This sense of ennui is common among the Workers, who often wonder if they truly contribute to their great society. Are they Honorable? Do their deeds improve the lives of their kin? The happiest Workers are generally those who see a tangible benefit from their deeds: retainers who faithfully serve a powerful landowner, mages who advance the science of their craft, a smith whose armor saves the life of a soldier. Altmer find the most meaning in these things, but rarely do they realize it. Many Workers with Youthful mindsets seek a (slightly) less decadent lifestyle, dedicated to deeds and the collective good. Many of these mer find themselves within fringe political tongs like the Thalmor, or serving radical groups like The Beautiful.

**Beasts**
-----------

Beasts form the backbone of industry in Summerset. Contrary to their name, Workers do little physical work, and spend their days supervising their bestial slaves. Discarnates cast nets into the sea, while aquiferi funnel sea-life toward them, all under the watchful eye of the local fishermer. Goblins are enthralled by a combination of illusion and sweat meats, and made to perform tasks unfit for the lowest Altmer. Because of their low birthrate, there are fewer Altmer than there are beasts in The Summerset Isles, though they often remain out of sight. If this caste were to vanish for a single week, Altmer society would collapse.

**Altmer Outside The Hierarchy**
---------

**Vartisans and Skyharkers**

Many Workers provide highly respected services that form the basis of Altmeri society. While Workers in theory, these mer are effectively outside the hierarchy. The most well-known of these Workers are the Vartisans and Skyharkers.

**Vartisans**:  Engineers that maintain the Varlines and Starwells. These mer ensure the continued survival of their people, and can even replace broken segments of the Varlines. They are often called upon to soothe restless Starwells, or to resolve glitches within the system. Vartisans literally worship the Varlines, and the Stars that provide their power. They are some of the few Altmer that actively worship Magnus and his Magne-Ge. They believe the Stars are proof that the Magne-Ge continue to watch over Nirn, and that they weep for their imprisoned kin. These views are heretical in religious othrodoxy, but as altmer society grows more secular, there's little reason to interfere with the Vartisan's curious beliefs. The eldest Vartisans become gibbering madmer, barely coherent but deeply in-tune with the flow of magicka. They show no signs of age, but strange, glowing crystals begin sprouting from their bodies. Eventually, they become entirely crystalline, at which point they're sculpted and merged into the Varlines themselves.

**Skyharkers**: These mer live in the Orrery, a city unto itself within the sprawling halls of Alinor. Here, they monitor, and in some small manner *control*, the movements of celestial bodies. These movements control the flow of magicka to the Varlines, and the Skyharkers effectively control where the magic goes. Each Skyharker communes with a plane(t) or constellation, at which point they become their living avatar. They maintain just enough individuality to steer the heavens in a direction that favors the Altmer, but the religions of the mannish races are constantly disrupting this process, whether they realize it or not. The vast majority come from the Syldarim Kinship, but they can come from all walks of life. Conflicts of interest are scarcely an issue, as once one becomes a Skyharker, they are beyond clan-based concerns.

**Outlanders**

Altmer from other provinces are seen with a mixture of curiosity and contempt. At best, they are wayward children returning to the fold, and must be embraced with open arms. At worst, they are vile race-traitors, likely the children of ousters, and should be driven out of the Blessed Isles along with the foreign dogs they serve. In general, they have no place in the Altmer hierarchy, and are treated as Imperial agents or colonists. Those who can trace their ancestry to a particular Kinship may be welcomed into the fold, especially in Kinships controlled by The Youth. Elder Kinships may accept them as retainers or mediators between the clan and the Empire, but rarely do they regard them as Kin.

**Ousters**

The Ousters are the untouchable pariahs of Altmer society. They have committed some unspeakable crime, and were exiled for it. Execution may be Honorable and Expected for a disgraced Altmer, but Ousters are granted no such favors. They are branded with a runic tattoo which covers half of their face, signifying their depravity. Those who dare show their face in public are treated with a sadism that goes beyond reason. Men and Beasts are more highly regarded than Ousters.

Ousters are less than animals. A Man can't help being vulgar and inferior, but Ousters choose their path. They are sick souls, and a waste of perfect altmer flesh.They've forsaken their duties and Expectations, and are thus traitors to all mer, and to The Aurbis itself. Killing them merely shortens their punishment, and gives their Spark a chance to find redemption in the next generation.This mindset is key to understanding the seemingly irrational hatred toward ousters.

No Altmer is above ousting, from the lowest worker to the High Queen Herself. If anything, Ousting is more common among the upper castes, as their lives are more public and their actions have a greater affect on the people. Imperial nobles are often disgusted by the practice of Ousting, as the aristocracy can be ousted for such "minor" acts as embezzling funds or allowing their Kin to starve.

The children of Ousters are no longer Ousters, but are considered Workers. Still, their ancestry is known to all, and they often find themselves incapable of employment. It is not Dishonorable to associate with the son of an Ouster, but Secret Honor discourages such behavior. They're generally encouraged to leave their homeland entirely. Recall that in Altmeri thought, the ancestor and the self share the same spark, and are therefore one in the same. Therefore, the child of an ouster is the same person as the ouster, and must live several more lives before they can be fully redeemed. Only after 5 generations can the descendant of an Ouster earn their way back into society, at which point they are treated as Outlanders.

**Sorcerer-Kings**

In Summerset, magic is omnipresent. Where once it was restricted to The Wise, respected Kin, and the reclusive Psijiic Monks, Vanus Galerion transformed the role of magic in Altmer society.  Today, even a common mer knows a few spells, passed down from their parents or learned from a traveling Wisemer.

Because of this, it's unfair to isolate a single magical faction within the Altmer. The Mages Guild has great influence in the province, but it's mostly considered an Imperial institution despite its origins. Every Kinship, every tong, and every criminal network is known to utilize magic in its own way. Still, there are those who operate on the fringes of Altmer society, who associate with these groups but never truly belong, whose ambitious motives are ultimately their own. These are the "Sorcerer-Kings".

Like most Altmer, they belong to a Kinship, but their relationship to their kin can vary widely. In theory, they act with semi-autonomy in the name of the Kinlord. In practice, they exist outside the Altmer hierarchy. In general, they keep to themselves, claiming their own territory and recruiting apprentices or retainers from a variety of cultures and kinships. They often create towers made of coral, either on remote beaches or within isolated lakes. Some say they learned these techniques from the sload, but the Sorcerers don't seem to care. Overtime, as their power-base grows, entire communities form around their lairs, a hodge-podge of kinfolk, miscreants, and outlanders. Unlike The Wise, they have little desire to share their knowledge without incentive. Sorcerer-Kings pay little heed to Altmeri traditions and beliefs, and their motives vary widely. Some are benevolent, and seek to enrich the rural communities in which they live. Others see their retainers as pawns in their unfathomable schemes. Ultimately, their chief concern is increasing their power and influence.

Because of Summerset's sparse and decentralized population, it's easy for a Sorcerer-King to create his own little fief before the Kinships have time to react. As they rarely interact with the outside world, many Kinlords are content to ignore them, while others attempt to align with them, censure them, or even return them to the Kinship-proper.

There's a constant tug of war going on between the Kinships and the Sorcerer-Kings. Today, there are several isolated regions entirely controlled by Sorcerers, who swear fealty to the Queen of Alinor, but ultimately rule the land as they see fit. In some Kinholds, the local Sorcerer-King has more influence than the Kinlord, much to their chagrin. The entire Kinhold of Cloudrest is ruled by a loose alliance of Sorcerer-Kings, after their Kinlady was displaced during the Numidium's attack.
