[Conceptual Reconstruction of the Pre-Time Events, Produced from the Animae Filters of the Cyro-Substantiated Dreamsleeve Fragments.]

*Warning: This reconstruction is in a test-state. It could contain some errors do to the polythemic nature of the state of this project. If you find some, please contact the [Prime-Whirling-Priest](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sawbones194).*

When Lorkhan was found guilty of betraying his kind, they tore his heart out and threw it at Magnus' new creation, upon which the Red Mountain grew. His body was divided into Secunda and Masser, the two moons of Nirn, who together describe the exact, non-existent date of Nirn's creation “The Second Mass Phase”.

But that was not revenge enough, and the Aedra cursed the moons that life would never arise there. But the anger of his kind, the Aedra, who also became Daedra, was still not satisfied. They sought all those whom the traitor and trickster called his descendants: His avatars.

The gigantic land lizards, with long necks or short arms and or spines and scales. The Aedra took their legs and claws, armor and teeth. They took from them everything that made them the greatest creations and left them censored, like a story without beginning or end.

But they let them live, for they were life, and the Aedra did not take life, they created it. They live which they may eternally live in the filth of the creation of their master, resting on deceit, and upon which they may be slain with a sword, the conceptual symbol of Aedra, through their mouths, which they would otherwise use to lie and betrayal. Almost all the Aedra were soothed, except for Bormahu, who wanted to add a pinch of humiliation.

So he dispatched a thought for the future existences, each of which will be superior to the trickster's avatars, and ordered them to portray him as a sword, which stake through the mouth of them. And he created new land-lizards, but let them rise above the creation of the liar and gave them the power to speak, the power of magic and the power to fly. He called them “sons of Bormahu.” He became their father. The first father of all.
