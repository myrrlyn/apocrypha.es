The Sol Imperator of our great Republic is a being that operates beyond our daily understanding. I have stood alongside the First of All, waged war upon Her enemies, treated with foreign diplomats in Her courts, meditated inside of and communed with Her Fire. Yet the Matriarch of the House of Dovahkiin is a trio of individuals, not a single one.

The Queen of Dragons and Men, walking in the footsteps of the Holiest and Many-Headed, who himself chased the Ghost of a beating heart, has emerged from the divine myth-echo of Talos-Son-of-Shezzar, under the endeavour of Three. 

There was Eris of Atmora; Change Incarnate, who Wandered from the Woodland draped in the totem-mantles of Kyne. Proud and voracious she-wolf, the Apex of Alphas, blizzard-born and battle-baptized, the Crafter and the Shaper.

There was the Revenant; Soul-Reaver, Mind-Flayer, Flesh-Carver. Shaded nightmare, who walked in place of the Fallen and they who had (been) forgotten, the Shadowthroat, the Devourer.

There was Astrid the Stormblade; Veins-of-Ice, Champion of Sun and Moon, who stood against the imperious foreigners and the light-less outlaws to craft Our Solar Republic. 

Though this path has brought much confusion and carnage to the shattered land of Skyrim, take heart dear citizens; for this country and others far beyond fall under the banner of the Sol Imperator. The fires of our industry and faith have been lit in the coldest and darkest of days, and it's warmth fast spreads across all our many hills and plains.

It was the struggle of these forces and the conquest of the World-Eater that echoed the footprints of He-Who-Was-Man. From those Divine Tones emerged the Celestial Aurator, Ismir Stormcrown, who is Talos Again. The Sun of the Republic, bringer of Light and Reason. 

Like the Dunmeri of the old Tribunal Temple, our people now walk without fear or uncertainty, as the Sol Imperator dazzles all the Republic, dragging evil into the light and shining favorably upon the righteous. Under this covenant, our Republic moves forward unto greatness, borne upon the backs of those with the strength to March.
