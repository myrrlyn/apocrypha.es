This compounds on a couple other lore posts, as well as my views allowing them all click together.
See them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/6v3see/magnus_the_leaper_demon_king/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/6s6sr8/theory_molag_bal_is_in_love_with_meridia/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/6surck/lore_challenge_how_would_michael_kirkbride_have/). I do not agree with everything in each of these, and wish to clarify points made as well as show how all this converges. They are nonetheless well worth the read.



Upon the creation of Mundus, but in the time before Convention, Magnus observed his fellow spirit's plight and strife, and perhaps wished to close the hole leaking energies from his Aetherius, which partially bound him to it.
Merid-Nunda was a spirit that admired Magnus, who's "life's work" he mournfully took note of through the Elder Scrolls, like a child on a school museum field trip. So she consorted with Lorkhan and Magnus himself. Magnus let a piece of himself fall to Mundus, which then forever wished to return, as any piece of Magnus would always crave the return to Aetherius. It was forced to leave, more as a clone than an agent. It was known as the Leaper Demon King, for it would "leap" higher and higher, trying to return back through the Sun to Aetherius.

Lorkhan saw the world(Nirn) he created and felt regret that he and Magnus caused for it's destruction, over and over and over with Alduin. Yet he knew without doubt that it must happen to create individuals who knew CHIM to eventually cause the Scarab. So he cut this conflicted piece from himself and it became the Greedy Man, as a divine cannot act against his nature (as shown by the [Leaper's coming transformation as punishment](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/seven-fights-aldudagga)). The Greedy Man loves everything a bit too much, and its creepy and disconcerting at times. yet he never wants to see any of it destroyed. He is the mannish god, so he wishes to own everything, control it, manifest his destiny.

The Greedy Man and the Leaper Demon King would distract Alduin, so that Merid-Nunda could hide away pieces of the world. She hid them in herself, where Alduin could never take them. This would eventually cause Alduin to burst, because he ate too much, and eventually all of Mundus would cease to exist. This would please Merid-Nunda, as Magnus would be pleased, and the Leaper Demon King because he would ascend to Aetherius. The Greedy Man on the other hand, would not like Mundus to be destroyed, as it would be long after the World-Eater stopped eating. I believe he planned to betray them both once Alduin was dead, he is a traitor and a selfish being, shown by how when things went sour with the World-Eater, he hid away and left the Leaper to be changed.

Alduin changes the Leaper Demon King into Dagon (just dagon), and Merid-Nunda is caught in the act of trying to destroy Magnus' creation. The Magna Ge banish her from Aetherius. The Greedy Man is trapped under a mountain, but he was the tricky *Thief* of Lorkhan, and by betraying the child of Magnus, he was allowed to become the *King* of Lyg, the God of Love of Lyg. Now Lyg is still part of Merid-Nunda, so the future God of Rape is taking ownership of a part of her. Merid-Nunda needs to remove this part of her to return to Aetherius, and appease the Magna Ge by returning what she stole. So she develops a new plot with Dagon, she sends him in with Mehrunes the Razor with the plan for him to be cut into Mehrunes Dagon, then destroy The Greedy Man and cut Lyg from her body so that she can return with Dagon, who currently cannot leap at all.

Mehrunes Dagon and The Greedy Man clash and the latter is destroyed, and by that I mean changed(as is the truth of destruction). A mortal is killed by the Razor, their AE sent to the appropriate principality. A divine cannot die in the traditional sense, and so The Greedy instead has a piece cut off as well. The piece cut off is the Ruddy Man(note the retroactive nature of Vivec's divinity), which stays in LYG as it falls into the ocean, into Memory. 

The Ruddy Man knows Love, but not Will. What remains is known as Molag Bal, exerting his terrible Will over others, which is without Love, as Love was cut away. He knows Will, but can not know true Love under Will. He has the remnant of Love, a sick, twisted version which is the impersonal greed of his former self. Lorkhan's vision is altered, he wishes to mess with the Dreamer instead of create a new, perfect dream. He seeks to dominate and not to create. 

&gt;Nirn will die and be purged of its weakness. It will become a place of infinite terror in a twisted realization of Lorkhan's original plan for existence. If this world is a nightmare, then make the nightmare has bad as possible so that the Godhead will awaken. If you recreate the horror of Nir's death, then the dream will become pointless. The Godhead will be forever changed. It will awaken anew, purged of weakness and desensitized to all Horror. Just as Bal and his followers have become desensitized to all horror over time. It will no longer fear loss and relish in its own strength. The Godhead will awaken as Molag Bal.

He wants to terrorize and make the Dream into a nightmare that will change the Dreamer into Molag Bal and scare him into waking, dominating the Dreamer to become himself. To do this he must first know CHIM, which is to know Love. Now, his version of Love is reversed. I would equate it to anti-CHIM, and he is then in many ways like the Sharmat. Molag Bal seeks to dominate, make others into himself, take pieces of Nirn in the Soulburst into his own land, take Nirn itself(then Oblivion) into his body. This is his goal, to make everything him so that he can say (a different form of) WE ARE ALL I, and know a twisted version of Love, which is to say "all do as I bid, and I love myself". Molag Bal begins this with another betrayal, betraying the one who *observed* these conflcits, Merid-Nunda, *wounding her by cutting a piece of her away*. This piece is Coldharbour, and he makes it his own, in his way as the God of Rape.

Bal and Dagon are forever warring, one being forced to want to destroy Nirn, the other wishing to rape. They are brothers, corruptions of their respected fathers' wishes. 

Leaper Demon King as the King, Greedy Man as the Thief who becomes the King, Merid-Nunda as the Observer. (Interestingly, a being of relation to Aka is not in the trio, as in most Entantiomorphs.) The Observer is wounded, becoming Meridia and losing the piece of her which became Coldharbour. This is shown by Mankar Camoran falsely naming Coldharbour as Meridia's.



edit: I recently found more proof that Lyg belongs to an aspect of Lorkhan, and thereby solidifying the connection between Lorkhan and Lyg's future ruler, TGM/Bal/TRM.

&gt;in the very bowels of Lyg, the domain of the **Upstart who vanishes**.
