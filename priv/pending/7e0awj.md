*In all my travels, I have seen wonders in this world. I have conversed with Dwemer Spectres, treated with the Daedric Powers, slain Vampire Ancients, and even held in my mortal hands fragments of Aetherius. And yet, all these things pale in comparison to my discovery of Mythril. This is, dear reader, not to be confused with that wondrous silken weave, Mothril, which was once a popular component in Cyrodiilic garments. Nor is it to be thought of as Mithril, a light, silver-white metal supposedly bound to the Moons and known for its strength.*

*No, the metal of which I speak is far stranger. I know not where it comes from and it has eluded my attempts at scrying its nature. All that I have been able to surmise from my experiments is that it is certainly not from Nirn. Superficially, it resembles Aetherial fragments such as those most famous Ayleid metals, meteoric glass and iron. It also resonates with the unique hum of magicka and radiates a piercing light when shrouded in darkness.* 

*However, this is where the similarities cease. The metal itself is warm to the touch and will melt snow or ice if placed near it. If it is held near an open wound, the injury will heal instantly, no matter the grievousness. If placed in water the metal will float until all the liquid is evaporated by its searing heat. Its properties are protean, constantly shifting with seemingly no explanation. Of the characteristics I have detailed, I shall further elaborate.*

*Its weight is unfixed and can change with no warning. A sword made of Mythril will hit with the weight of a warhammer on contact with flesh. However, when being swung, it is as light as a small dagger. The force of such blows (to the ignorant) may dislocate one's arm or else damage the body unexpectedly.*

*It takes fire enchantments well and will boil blood, sear flesh, melt body fat into sizzling greasy torrents, immolate a corpse, and conjure an inferno at the wielder's command. The blade will be cool to the touch for the wielder but will burn all others. In my experiments, I found that this was only achievable if a drop of the wielder's blood was introduced into the forging process.* 

*Amongst the other properties heretofore mentioned, the metal will radiate  a bright blue Aetherial light when shrouded by darkness. This light is sufficient to repel the undead and those creatures whose domain is the nocturnal. If made into armour, the light will illuminate the wearer with a radiant halo. In this way, a blade made of Mythril superficially resembles the Daedric artefact, Dawnbreaker, a favoured weapon of Meridia and her Aurorans.*

*When beaten into metallic sheets, a great mail can be made which is strong, durable, and yet flexible enough both for comfort and mobility. The energies coursing through the mail will turn spell-fire and will even reflect the blows of arrows and weapons, even weapons as large as hammers, maces, and spears. Moreover, when gifted to another (and when the proper words and sigils are present), it will change form to better suit the user.*

*And yet, its most remarkable ability lies in its form. For any weapon or piece of armour made from Mythril can be shaped at the user's will. An arming sword may at a moment's notice become a pole-arm, or a helmet a set of greaves. There is no rhyme or reason to these transformations save that they are bound and controlled by the user's will.* 

*Thus, to conclude this metallurgical treatise, I shall say that in my experiments I have never found any material Daedric, Aetherial, or Mundial that so mimics Mythril's properties. I surmise that Mythril is condensed Belief; Mythopoeia made manifest. The Essence of the Divine Ada for it is not bound by Mundane laws and shifts as it wills.*
