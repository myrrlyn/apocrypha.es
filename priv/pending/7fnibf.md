Chapter One: The Petrites


A tall stone sits off the northern coast of Northmoor. Atop it, one can see a lighthouse, shining blue light across the ocean. This lighthouse, constructed early in the third era, has truly stood the test of time. It is maintained by the Petrites, a blue-robed order of monks who live on the rock. To survive, the Petrites mend and make lamps, fish, and trade with locals on the shore.

The order was founded in 3E 15, following the death of the charismatic Saint Petri, who preached the life-giving power of light. He advised his followers to, carry spare lanterns to give to those who do not have lanterns, and to carry spare oil to give to those who do not have oil. It is said his eyes were like the starry skies.

The Petrites worship Magnus, the father of light and magic, and hold reverence for the Magna-Ge Laov. The Petrites keep a telescope in their lighthouse pointed to Laov’s gate, which glows an indescribable colour. It is for this reverence that they are sometimes referred to by challengers of faith in Magnus as The Cult of Laov’s Gate.

Laov is said to have been one of the last Magna-Ge. As he fled, he was grabbed by an unknown force, whose grasp was firm and strong. Laov barely escaped, and his body was torn in two. His blood made a field of astral clouds, which obscures his gate. Only the exalted Petrites know how to gaze through these clouds, and see Laov's gate.

Hieropriests from The Petrite monastery are said to have a bright aura about them, which they temporarily confer onto those whom they touch. The light from the aura brings about a sense of comfort, healing and serenity. They are also gifted with the ability to detect curses in the eyes of those around them.

The current Abbot, as of 3E 365, is Father Chivius Magnus. He is proceeded by Myrdin Magnus, who was proceeded by Apposias Magnus.
