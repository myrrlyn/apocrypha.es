from Maximus Occidentia's forward to "Sul Saren's Hermenutica Pan-Tamrielica", published by the University of New Gwylim Press, 6E 253.

…it was during these researches that I discovered the following textus:

“Oyarsa – lit. ‘lord of Being’, the governor of a celestial sphere; an angel”

Lumenocentric analysis placed the text’s provenance in a Where other than Tamriel Now, analogous to our own 7th Era.  Given the revelations of the so-called “Zyr” texts, the implications are startling.

We have always known that the Arena is open to mythopoetic manipulation.  While the idea of Lorkhan as the Daedric Lord of Nirn was refuted as far back as the 3rd Era, what if a “Guiding Star” arose in the 5th?  An Intelligence seeking to impose its own vision, its own intent ("Being") – to remake Nirn in its own image?  

Perhaps we are lucky the O.Y.A.R.S.A. and its Ghost Choir were defeated in the fires of Landfall.  Who can guess what horrors they might have wreaked upon Tamriel Renewed?
