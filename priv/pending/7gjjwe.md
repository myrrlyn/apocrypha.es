Markarth, as we know, is a major city situated firmly in the Dragontail Mountains. It is a very old and protected city, safe from Reachman attacks. Karthwasten, as we all know, is a mere mining village the size of Shor's Stone. What sets it apart from Shor's Stone, however, is that at one point it was a major city that dominated the economy and politics of The Reach, and was a city that equalled the importance of even Whiterun.

Are they really as they seem, however?

Upon my observations of the maps within the library, the Arcanium, here at the College of Winterhold, I have noticed a peculiarity within The Reach, specifically between Markarth and Karthwasten. The peculiarity, you ask? Why, it appears they have switched positions over time, and nobody realized it! Upon examination of a map dating to [3E 427](https://www.imperial-library.info/sites/default/files/imagecache/node-gallery-display/gallery_files/minibigmaproadslore31gv.jpg) shows the city of Markarth Side where present-day Karthwasten sits. A cartographer error, you say? Well, a map of Skyrim dating to [3E 432](https://www.imperial-library.info/sites/default/files/imagecache/node-gallery-display/gallery_files/obcodex_skyrim.jpg) appears to show Markarth Side, again, in the location of present-day Karthwasten. Perhaps two cartographers committed to the same error? A bit unlikely. This is evidence of the two cities changing places, whether in name or otherwise. 

A theory, perhaps an exodus from Markarth Side to Karthwasten took place, perhaps from raids by the Reachmen have driven the citizens of Markarth Side off, seeking refuge to Karthwasten, to which is renamed to Markarth for one reason or another, perhaps by refugee demand. In response to this, Markarth Side takes the name of Karthwasten. As unlikely as it may seem, it could provide an explanation as to why Markarth and Karthwasten appear to have switched places between the third era and today. 

Unfortunately, despite being the premier source of knowledge in all of Skyrim, there are no records of any single event taking place to cause this. I will set out on an expedition myself to solve this mystery once and for all. If I come back alive from those madmen-infested lands, I will update my findings and research.
