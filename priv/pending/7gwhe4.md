It is here in the Cave alone with my thoughts of you,  
that I understand the truth of your Water-Face,   
and it is like I am home again, as I soar to you.  

Know that whatever three words I say next,   
my heart will always sing for you.  

It is at the altar of Secunda that I take your name,  
surrounded by family that walked with me,   
but Ald betrays me to my cold Father as we knew he would,   
and so I become lost to Him and must sail far away,  
in the ship we built together from the old wood.  

I can already feel your wind at my sails,  
the freedom of my promise to you.  

However long the Dragon binds me,  
know I will always love you.  

Breathe deep, for I take my leave,  
the Children will remember me by your Tears,  
tell them to bury me on the shoreline,   
and to the old armies,   
I have Returned.
