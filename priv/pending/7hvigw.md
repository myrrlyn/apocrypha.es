Many hundreds of years ago, the sage Enji ran afoul of the great Beast Herma-Mora. Before his imminent destruction at the limbs of the Lord of Doors Ajar, he sang this hymn in praise of the Prince:

***

Homage to Prince Mora/
O thou who art beautiful/
With the beauty of a dark rain cloud. 

Homage to Prince Book-of-Foreign-Script/
Who, having taught the gods/
Knew the time to tame the Arena. 

Homage to Prince Enigma/ 
Destroyer of 108 cities/
And all who recite your name with piety. 

Homage to the One of Many Eyes/
Born out of Auspicious Woodlands/
Where Jhunal and Alduin revered you. 

O Mother and Father/
By removing the first and the last/
You whisper royal secrets to your beloved. 

Great Prince with disheveled hair/
From the corners of whose mouths streams of blood trickle/
You are perfect in your freedom. 

Homage to the Prince of Miracles/
Unmatched throughout the 779 realms/
Teacher of proper conduct who accepts the offerings of gods. 

Homage to Prince Yawning/
Whose mind is weighted with melancholy/
Never to be fully known by mortals. 

Homage to Prince Oldest/
Keeper of books to old to touch/
And memories too old for mortal sight. 

Homage to Apocrypha/
The perfect Daedroth-Field/
To where all devout may one day ascend. 

O Teacher and Master/
Composed of the first group of letters/
Who spends countless time contemplating himself,

Great Prince with countless mouths/
From which the blackest books were formed/
Hear my humble offering and have mercy. 

***

It is said that the Demon was so pleased that he transcribed the hymn and keeps a copy in his own secret chamber in the recesses of his realm. Enji, for his piety, was transformed into a writing mass of tentacles and claws. After one otherworldly screech that could be heard for miles, he was never seen again.
