**The White and Gold of a Harbour Cold**   
*By Avarian the Poetaster*

Many places I have been  
And many I have seen  
Places beyond mortal ken  
And places quite obscene.

There are worlds so vast and different  
From Tamriel's bright shores   
Skies that never Magnus rent  
And lands that were never yours.

In these bloody fiefdoms  
Of Daedra, gods, and more  
I have heard the lutes and drums  
Of endless, lusty war.

For here I found the bitter brink  
Of all those souls that roam  
But never did I quite think  
It'd look so much like home.

There she stands so brilliantly  
Against the gore-stained sun  
A White-Gold Tower, with dignity  
But not the only one.

For she was cracked and bleeding  
Her glory marred and spent  
In the mournful, wretched proceeding  
Of those whose wills had bent.

The mad, the dead, the sour  
Had clustered round her ring  
And wept and keened against the hour  
That they might see their king.

I looked, and there, a fire on high  
Blackened, dread, and foul  
A lord of rape fell from the sky  
Amongst the souls to prowl.

She struggled and she shook  
A knightess till the last  
But the Prince had come, and on that rook  
Released a hellish blast.

And that, dear reader, is how it's told  
In every song and call  
The White and Gold of a Harbour Cold  
Did fall to Molag Bal.

My submission for the weekly theme, [Grand Structures](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/7irgry/the_weekly_community_thread_122_129/). I've been on a serious Daedric kick lately (which probably stems from [Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67103), a flatly beautiful and astoundingly well-made quest mod for Skyrim), with Coldharbour's twisted, desiccated expression of Nirn capturing my interest in particular, so I decided to write about this. It seems very fitting for Molag Bal to create and then repeatedly breach and destroy one of the longest-standing symbols of Tamriel's ability to resist and repulse Daedric invasions, even if it's just a copy. The symbolism is there, and if Molag Bal can appreciate anything, it's the *idea* of what you're doing, not just the physical results.

Also, I thought of the rhyming title while humming to myself. That helped too.
