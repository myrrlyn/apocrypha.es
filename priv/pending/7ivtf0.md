The following texts are the contents of a number of "sequence paques" (as they are called in the Clockwork City) found in the recently rediscovered ruins of Bamz-Amschend beneath Mournhold. They were originally located in the inner vaults of the ruin, where Sotha Sil has placed the enterance to his Clockwork City. As requested by the Mages Guild, I have compiled all writings found in this vault of Bamz-Amschend below for the Guild to study. They appear to be similar (but not identical) texts written in several different languages, Dwemeris, Ald Chimeris and Dunmeris in addition to Cyrodiilic. While the Temple was quick to restrict access to the ruins after its rediscovery was made known, my contacts made it possible for me to enter Bamz-Amschend to study the Clockwork City vault; albeit supervised by a Temple Ordinator. They refused to actually let me enter the Clockwork City of Sotha Sil, however. A pity.

Anyways, here are the writings the Guild requested me to transcribe.
