Seriously, this series is gold. I feel it's a war crime that we only got three short stories, his books have a wonderful mix of action and suspense, and read like an energetic old man recounting stories of his youth to younger patrons at a bar.

I've never really written any sort of story before, but since I believe we should all be the change we want to see in the world, I went ahead and threw together my own entry to the bestiary!
