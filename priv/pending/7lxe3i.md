*It began as an academic debate, over the evening meal (the larded hare was particularly delicious that night), about the nature of Elsweyr's infamous Moon Sugar. Particularly the claim from the Khajiit of it being crystallized moon light. It was towards the end of our discussion, and subsequently our finely seasoned meal, that Sister Melensae jested that one of us should attempt to divine an Elder Scroll while under the influence of Moon Sugar. The joke received it's fair share of laughter...but, perhaps, piqued far too many curiosities. It was not even a full day later our group submitted a petition to the upper echelons to perform the experiment.*

*Brother Vorancius agreed to be the willing test subject and...well, it was quite the nerve wracking experience. At one point, he attempted to actually eat an Ancestor Moth! It took quite a bit from us to enable him to complete the ritual. Upon which, however, he uttered these words:*

Allow ourselves to be eaten by the Dragon. Then look back at the Dawn and see the Time which we recognize as the Dragonborn and see the Space which we recognize as the Shezzarine. Look back further and see the Birthed Soul which we recognize as Time and see the other Birthed Soul which we recognize as Space. Look back further and see the Primordial which we recognize as the Birthed Soul and see the other Primordial which we recognize the Birthed Soul. Look back further and see that which we do not know but recognize as Primordial and see the other which we do not know but recognize as Primordial.

Now step to side and blink. See the Dragonborn god who is eleven. See as they love anew.   

*The words were recorded and put away for later study. For the time being, we are more concerned with researching the possible adverse effects on Brother Vorancius's mind and body. Interestingly enough, after coming out of the euphoric state, he has no recollection of the events. Perhaps some unintended side-effect of the Moon Sugar and the tuning of the Ancestor Moths?*
