*This poem was discovered by a priest of Orkey in the year 436 of the Second Era, when he was cleaning the older sections of Windhelm's Hall of the Dead. It was found inscribed on the burial urn of Kallstir the Axe-Swinger, one of Ysgramor's five-hundred companions. I have here transcribed the old Atmoran writing to the modern Cyrodiilic writing system, and made a translation of it into Cyrodiilic below; this to ensure that remnants of our proud Nordic cultural heritage is not lost to time, and can be enjoyed by generations to come.*

A, bilkir narkurj hrust

Svartr au ynthar vluust

Hja jak makhtahrlir athaj

Thar althir air oha sethaj

Wittir ynthaj mith bar

I du mor air lik anvaar

Air skjen veetaur Kynej

I kraftur Shorj sovnej

Air skjen thodr kereinust

I ai wiig sall ynthar athaiust

I athallr tha ynthar ubaktr

Oh, stones of the frozen ground

Dark thing in a land of snow

You, unbreakable god-thing

Whom ancestors before me have seen

Carry wisdom of the world along

And pass it on to men like me

Grant me Kyne's wisdom

And Shor of the eternal rest's power

Grant me an honourable death

And I will forever serve this divine land

And all the gods who watch over it
