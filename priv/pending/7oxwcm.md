Malacath gave unto his children beskhar (i)

So that Ornim (ii) may strike steel so hot

From the anger and the anguish festered and scarred

Forging posionious rage into every swing and shot.

"Rakh vorkim ren Crunzarga!": (iii)

Armoured in anger are golzarga (iv)

Who weep not tears but the foes shall

Who weep rivers of blood that stream morale.

A breastplate struck with such awesome anger

Shall not bend or falter under an enemies clangour.

Nor will a shield shatter that stares, spurned and smiling.

For Mauloch curses their foes in every swing and block.

Though golzarga are armoured in faith,

Faith must be armoured in steeled salvation

For Mauloch, in the face of the ostracised  

Tells his children to feel the forge from their creation.


(i) The forge

(ii) The Orcs

(iii) "Blades armoured in revenge!"

(iv) The cherished
