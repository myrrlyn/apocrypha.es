**A Response to /u/phantom-scribbler 's [Orcish Music (and other races) thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/7nky0o/orcish_music_and_other_races/)**

*The following is constructed from various ideas, including:*

===========================
MAULOCH, OUR LORD.
===========================

*[the faint bang of drums, in sync and in rhyme]*

**(Chief / Shaman)**

Mauloch, our Lord!

Come, our lord!

Come, our lord!

*[throat chants, cheers from the group]*

Mauloch, our Lord!

Come, our lord!

Come, our lord!

*[intensity of drumming and chanting increases; use of weapons on wood / forging tools on armour as instruments]*



You will know that we call you 

**(Group response)**

Sim eb Agra!

**(Chief / Shaman)**

To show you our piety, our Lord

**(Group response)**

Crun eb Glushun!

[*Brief Interlude; Offerings placed by the Statue of Mauloch*]

**(Chief / Shaman)**

Our strong lord!

**(Group Response)**

Crun Eb Sim!

**(Chief / Shaman)**

Mauloch, our Lord!

*[Horns blow and blows are struck.]*

**(Shaman / Wisewoman)**

*[Sang from the throat, accompanied by audiences throats.]*

Mauloch!

Rakh eb Arga!

Crun eb Glushun Dek ren Beshkar!

Crunzarga, Crunzarga

*[chorus of "Crunzarga, Crunzarga!"]*

**(Chief / Shaman)**

Mauloch, our Lord!

**(Group Response)**

Come, our lord! (Crun, Crunzarga!)

**(Chief / Shaman)**

Come, our lord!

**(All)**

Oh Mauloch! (Mulak!)

Oh Malak! (Voshu!)

Oh First Orc! (Voshu!)

Come to Us!

Come to Us!

Come to Us!

Come to Us!

*[throat chanting throughout]*

Oh our lord (Mauloch)

Oh our lord (Maluk, Maluk!)

Our strong lord (Hail Torug!)

Our strong lord (Hail Torug!)

[fade; throat chanting fades first, then the weapons / tools / armour noise, then finally the drums]

(hail Malak!)

**(Chief / Shaman)**

Malak our Lord (Hail Mauloch)

Malak our Lord (Crun eb Sim!)

Oh Lord (Ornim, Ornim!) 

*[a mighty shout, in the tradition of Mauloch, to blot out the sun!]*
