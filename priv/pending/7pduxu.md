*Part chant to help rowers keep time, part prayer against the often foul and dangerous weather in the Sea of Ghosts, I recorded this song from the crew of the Langtskradjar, a fishing vessel operating from the port of Dawnstar. It consists of a call and response; one side of rowers singing out in Tamrielic, the other singing out in the ancient dragon-tongue, the language of Skyrim's great Word Walls and Dragon-chants. Accompanied by the beating of a large cow-skin drum, one can imagined its effect when bellowed by 20 burly Nord fishermen. -Caoran Fiascian, U. Gwylim*

**Kaan fin Ven, Monah Brom-muz** *(Kyne the Wind, Mother of the Nords [lit. North-men])*

Wind and Rain, through which we row,

**Spaan okaaz-muz faad hofkiin** *(Shield these sea-men warmly home)*

Wretched sea defies us, oh.

**Dibyey sil-frin, hofkiin kun** *(Dibella, soul-heat [fervor?], home light)*

Ice and rocks and reefs that crack,

**Spann okaaz-muz faad hofkiin** *(Shield these sea-men warmly home)*

Nord-men now defy them back.

**Modre, deinmaar, Ven aar-lot** *(Mara, guardian, Wind's [Kyne's] great-servant)*

Clan and hall await us home,

**Spaan okaaz-muz faad hofkiin** *(Shield these sea-men warmly home)*

Over deadly seas we roam.

**Tsun zeymah, zahkrii wah paal** *(Tsun Brother, sword to foes)*

Every inch draws us to port,

**Spaan okaaz-muz faad hofkiin** *(Shield these sea-men warmly home)*

Damn the sea-ghosts at their sport!

**Shor Zok-jun, fodiiz bormah** *(Shor greatest king, Hoar-father)*

If the storm never abates,

**Spaan okaaz-muz faad hofkiin** *(Shield these sea-men warmly home)*

Brave souls Sovngarde awaits.
