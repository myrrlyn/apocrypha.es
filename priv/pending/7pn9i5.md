#4: Jafnhar the Young (ME 61 - ME 61)

*by High Chronicler Valerius of Winterhold*

---
Prince Jafnhar was the youngest son of the Totem-King Heimverlund and Finna [Prince-Slayer](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Fall_of_the_Snow_Prince). Born in ME 70, he was never destined for the throne as Heimverlund had named Jafnhar's older brother as his successor many years earlier. Skerd-Prince Grymvaar was serving as an oblate in the priesthood and was to follow in the Totem-King's footsteps by eventually becoming a high priest and leading the ruling council. However after most of his clan was exterminated, Jafnhar was left as the last surviving legitimate heir. 

At only nine years old and with no strong allies or family remaining, Jafnhar was in no position to take the throne and was forced into hiding for a period of time. Some sources claim he only survived the purge of his bloodline by the intervention of Ahzidal, King Ylgar's old adviser. During this time all of Skyrim mourned the death of the royal family, for they were much loved. Civil unrest grew across the land and many sought vengeance. Rebellions erupted and tributes from every Hold ceased flowing to the priesthood, while the ruling council descended into bitter infighting.

#Whiterun's Hope
Jafnhar was taken into the care of [Guri Nail-Face](https://www.imperial-library.info/sites/default/files/pge01_skyrim_pic_02.jpg), one of the few surviving Skerd, who arranged his safe passage to Whiterun after several weeks in hiding. Jarl Haelga Raven-Hair was loyal to Ysgramor's clan and hailed Jafnhar's arrival as a blessing. Whiterun was a prosperous Hold but the death of the royal family had completely destabilized her region. Many of her subjects were still loyal to the priesthood, while others were openly inciting rebellion against them. Violence between these two parties was becoming commonplace and a ruler who could unify both was desperately needed. Jarl Haelga believed the young prince was destined to lead, just as his forefathers before him, and rejected the lordship of the priesthood. The city-folk named Jafnhar as their new king and his coronation took place shortly after in Whiterun.

Kingship was hollow without the blessing of the Dragons, and they were known to only commune with the priesthood. Jafnhar the Young, brave but reckless, decided to seek out the great dragon roosting at the summit of Snow-Throat and demand his rule to be recognized. The climb to the summit supposedly took three days, but young Jafnhar arrived to find the great Lodunost, Pale Drake of the East slumbering. According to legend, Jafnhar approached the dragon and bellowed his demands at the beast. Lodunost awoke, but no sooner had Jafnhar paused to take breath did Lodunost engulf him in a storm of fire. 

Jafnhar's remains were supposedly buried on the mountain itself and in later years [a monument was erected at the summit](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fire_Breath) honoring his sacrifice. With his demise, the known bloodline of Ysgramor ceased to be. Skyrim was plunged into an age of dark as the priesthood assumed full control. Leading them was a hitherto unknown priest who emerged after the downfall of the Totem-King. His name was Miraak, known also as the first Dragonborn.
