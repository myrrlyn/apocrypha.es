For the Tribal Orsimer, religion is integral to society. The strongholds are built on the Code of Mauloch. Even Gortwog's heretical Trinimac cult demanded religious conformity. Thus, due to the importance of religion in stronghold society, Heresy is considered a damnable crime indeed.

If you are a heretic, you cannot stay in the stronghold, whether by banishment or exile, or your consent in leaving.

However, I also propose that banishment is not the sole punishment. If it was, then the insult to the honour of the stronghold would have gone unpunished, for it means that the heretic has the opportunity to spread their heresy elsewhere, and, thus, only *Crunzarga* is the answer to punish them. 

A sign marked on the body (a scar, losing a finger or other part of the body, like an ear or an eye), ritualised to make it apparent to all Orcs they come across,  would be a suitable punishment to warn all that Heretics who insult Malacath, through *crun*, insults to honour are paid in part.
