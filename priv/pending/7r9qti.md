Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

"In the heat of battle the sharpest blades are forged"

It is true, as you confidently say.

For in the spar, such primal endeavours are engorged

And in the heat, strength is the order of the day. 

But let not strength lead to compliancy

For even if a chief has been pierced with a blade

He must fulfil his pious duty to be in the longhouse laid.

For the strong must pass down their vitality,

For it must be put community before carnality

And those who fail in their divine duty

Shall be denied Ashpit for all eternity.

==========================================
While Homosexuality or Homosexual activity is not prohibited by Mauloch, care must be taken that indulgence in such activates does not cause any dishonour (in that it does not interfere in passing on the strongest genetics from the Chief to his children through heterosexual intercourse).
