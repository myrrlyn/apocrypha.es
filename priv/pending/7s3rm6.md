*I was fortunate enough to record this song one evening in an inn, as the merchant caravan I traveled with rested. One of the guards produced what I believe is called a nickel harp, and began to play a steady, droning melody. The other guards began to sing; bittersweet harmonies, rough but emotional. The chorus is in the Nordic vernacular, which I have translated to the best of my ability, but I could swear I have heard the tune elsewhere, possibly on the docks in Anvil. -Caoran Fiascian, U. Gwylim*

Oh, the Hoar-king's beard grows thick and white,

*Leggja af stað, Jónas,*

As the dawn's first rays break through the night,

We sail homeward on, to Skyrim.

*Leggja af stað, Jónas,* *(Be going onward, Jonas)*

*Leggja af stað, Jónas,* *(Be going onward, Jonas)*

*Sumarið flýgur og Það er timið vorum heim,* *(Summertime flies, and it's time we were home)*

*Vetur kemur brað i Monahven,* *(Winter comes soon enough to Skyrim)*

The sea-ghosts blew and the waves ran high,

*Leggja af stað, Jónas,*

From Windhelm all the way to Stros M'kai,

We sail onward, back to Skyrim.

*Leggja af stað, Jónas, etc...*

We tear onward home, through storm and squall,

*Leggja af stað, Jónas,*

For there's kin and mead within our halls,

We sail homeward on, to Skyrim.

*Leggja af stað, Jónas, etc...*

Fly you home to kinfolk, while you can,

*Leggja af stað, Jónas,*

When evgir unslaad begins again,

We'll sail far away from Skyrim...

*Leggja af stað, Jónas,*

*Leggja af stað, Jónas,*

*Sumarið flýgur og Það er timið vorum heim,*

*Vetur kemur brað i Monahven.*
