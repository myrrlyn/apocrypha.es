Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!


But let he who smites your holy words be damned;

Let those who call you 'demon' and 'false prince'

Be rewarded with your wild wrath and be hanged

by the gonads to savour them wince.

Then, slice through screeching flesh and bone:

Beat and burn them, chop them into pieces:

See if the pieces scream when in a ditch they are thrown

And let it be the end of their venomous diseases.

He who purges heretics from the earth

Shall be forever be in Malak's eternal girth

But he who lets the dishonour lie

Shall never get to Ashpit when he shortly dies.
