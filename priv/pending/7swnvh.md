Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

A Chieftain has his duty to take wives

To forge the steel and to wield bows and knifes;

To catch game and to show their worth

In both the fires of battle and the fires of birth.

A union held under Mauloch's stern eye;

Held in his strongholds under midnight sky

With dowry paid and the blood-rings forged

In awe of the fathers grips engorged.

Vows blessed, volleyed in call-and-response

Of "Mauloch, Mauloch!"

And "Bless now this holy wedlock"

For he truly thunders his response! 

Crun! Crun! One are the couples blood

From hand to heart to battle shall the love last;

And from this to bear children for their love

That shall make the ground tremble and the weak aghast. 

Bearing the blood and the blood-ring, a gift of her new honour

Is given to show that she is her fathers no longer;

For the first a gifted bow, for the second a forging hammer:

For she shall strike the fear into every foe and blasphemer!

The union is concluded consummation

After, at every station, a celebration

Till sunrise in its golden lay

Passed by in spar and pray.
