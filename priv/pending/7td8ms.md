“Hush, my child. Your parents are sleeping; it would be unwise to wake them. I know you are smart and would like to play, but I am a mongrel, thus I have no respect outside of this wing of the manor, so cannot take you outside. Besides, it is far too late! But as I said, i am a mongrel: I may look like you and your family, but my skin is slightly too hairy, my ears not quite pointed.

Everyone believes that I am the offspring of an illicit union between a noble Ayleid duchess and one of her favourite Nedic slaves; this is true. Although they were blessed in love, many accused my parents of assaulting one another, and all three of us were shunned. While my mother and I managed to flee to this city, my father was sent to a different jurisdiction. I pray to the gods that he will prosper. Anyway, while not persecuted here because there is no proof of my mixed descent, we are still not respected, because everyone knows the rumours and can see my physical peculiarities, so I cannot risk such an audacious venture.

Tell you what: how about a story? Not one of those patronising and false tales, but a glorious myth of your ancestors. Would you like that? Hm, I guessed as much. You’ve always been inquisitive.This is one my favourites from my mother.

Back when the world was new, and the gods and ancestors were still learning to Walk, the Mer were led by the noble Lord of Time, Auri-El.

You thought that that was Akatosh? Ah, I understand. You see, we used to use the name Akatosh as an epithet: it describes his nature, see. Akatosh means Time Dragon, and this name refers to his glorious majesty as the legitimate, eternal ruler of Time and all that passes. We often use Akatosh as a name now during worship services, but the Aldmer, the ancestors of all Mer, knew him as Auri-El, a personal name for him, used in adoration.

Anyhow, Auri-El fought ferociously and magnificently, flourishing as he led the Aldmer against the forces of Lorkhan.

While this was going on, another blessed father, Magnus, observed with intelligent caution. He watched with his favourite children: Merid-Nunda, Mnemo-Li, Xero-Lyg... you know who they are. Anyway, they regarded the nature of the world that they were building, and observed their beloved companions dwindling as they gave more of themselves to the world.

As the God of Sight, Light and Insight, hoary Magnus wisely fled to Aetherius, along with many companions, in the attempt to retain his being, while impacting and perfecting the world from a distance. This is why his favourite children Orphaned themselves: to become his mediators with the world. In the process of fleeing, Magnus and his friends leapt beyond the blessed Moons and tore holes through Oblivion to escape back to whence they came.

Now, around the same moment when Magnus fled, Auri-El was on the cusp of winning. However, his grace was being hollowed out by his arrogance. He fought vainly for his reputation rather than for practicality.

When it came to Lorkhan’s trial, Auri-El had succumbed to mortal whims, and, realising the error of his ways, fixed the next events in linear time, so that these mistakes would never be forgotten.

He charged Lorkhan with trickery and deception, which Lorkhan gracefully accepted. I know, my dear... how surprising indeed! But we just remember that, though Lorkhan was an over-zealous and stubborn fool with foul aims, he appeared to have honest intentions: that is, he genuinely believed he had done right by the world.

Lorkhan was duly punished for his iniquity, but then the gods realised the gravest of truths: this was all documented, including their submission to mortality. Auri-El, panicking, cared not for his fellows, and acted alone to preserve himself.

Boasting of his prowess, Auri-El gathered his followers and charmed them with his beautiful charisma and his fervent love for the Mer.

As they lauded and shouted and praised his name, Auri-El extended his wings in a display of authority, and launched himself upwards, flying across the boundary of the world and directly through the hole created by Magnus.

As you well know, this hole is the Sun, Magnus’s link back to the world. But Auri-El stole it: he made the Sun and thing of Time, not Possibility: why do you think we measure our days with the Sun? It’s true purpose was to bleed Magic into the world to allow us to prosper, but his was hijacked by Auri-El as a symbol of his own supremacy.

Some of our cousins to the north and the distant south-west still praise Auri-El for these feats, but we Ayleids know better. We know that while Auri-El was strong and admirable and loving, he was presumptuous. We worship him, but moderately: he blesses us and showed us how to escape mortality, but is too aloof.

And this is why we praise Magnus as one of our chief deities: he gave us Magic: he gave us the gift of Possibility in a world that seemed fixed by the Limits of mortal death and bound by the linearity of Time. He gave us the tools to escape this world, and we know he is humbly waiting for us all.

There you are, my sweet. I know, my darling, it is a truly extraordinary tale. Now drift off into slumber, dream of the shining ineffability of Magnus the Mage, and know that one day, we will all return to him.”
