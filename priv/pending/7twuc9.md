*A legend from a radical cult of Stuhn in the Rift that disappeared around the late Second Era. The few sources we have paint them as a sect of healers who took vows of peace and nonviolence, a rarity among the Nords. Evident parallelisms with the Harmonious Masters of Lillandril, but nothing suggests a direct link between the two groups.*

It is said that of all the gods that marched alongside Shor in his campaign against the oppression of the accursed elves, no one loved traveling more than Stuhn, his Shield-Thane and brother of Tsun. He often traveled to the courts of the enemy to negotiate the ransom of prisoners, but he also liked to disguise himself as one of the common folk and see the world through their eyes.

Stuhn saw many of the Children of the Sky fighting and dying in battle, warriors and heroes who faced death without fear. And Stuhn’s heart was happy for them, for he knew that the feats of those brave souls had earned them a place in Sovngarde, the promised afterlife of Shor.

However, Stuhn also witnessed other things that made his heart grieve.

In his travels, the Shield-Thane met the poor, the weak, the sick, the infirm, the invalid, the enslaved, those who were too old or too young to go to battle, and those who had so much compassion in their hearts that they chose to spend their whole lives healing and aiding their fellow countrymen instead of seeking glory in the battlefield. For them, there was no Sovngarde, only the cold jaws of Orkey. The most desperate would even pledge their souls to the powers of Oblivion, seeking power to break the chains of reality. This displeased Stuhn, for he knew that even the least malignant of the Princes of the Void are cruel and arbitrary, and do not really care about the needs of mortals.

So Stuhn went back to the realm of the gods and implored Shor:

“My lord, you who are King of the Underworld, I beg you to open the doors of your hall so every Nord can enjoy the pleasures of Sovngarde.”

“My people are warriors, and warriors are my people”, said Shor. “There is a reason for Sovngarde to be as it is. And I cannot change it, neither in this cycle nor in the next. The sinister Orkey also has a role to play. As long as he respects my laws, my hands are tied.”

“Then let me take them”, proposed Stuhn. “I will welcome all of them in my embrace.”

In that moment, Mother Kyne, who acted as the arbiter of the meeting, intervened:

“That is not for you to decide, brother of Tsun. It is the mortals who write down the destinations of their souls by the choices they make during life. Even Shor can only accept those who have proved themselves worthy of the Hall of Valor.”

“Then let mortals write my name in their hearts”, insisted Stuhn. “For those who dream of a better world, for those who suffer in silence, for those who devote themselves to their fellow mortals, I will build a House. As long as there is mercy in their souls and my name in their lips, the doors will be open to them. There, they will be able to wait in peace and calm until the next cycle, or strive to find their way into Sovngarde by deeds of valor.”

The gods were moved by Stuhn’s words, saw the wisdom and the compassion in them, and agreed to his terms.

“So be it”, said the Kiss at the End. “But for every boon there is a price. What will you do to pay for it, Shield-Thane?”

“I will walk the earth as many times as needed, with my children, and the children of my children, for all eternity or until the cycles end. I will be their shield and their light, and I will watch over them even when my name is ignored. But for those who do not forget, my House will be waiting. So swears Stuhn.”
