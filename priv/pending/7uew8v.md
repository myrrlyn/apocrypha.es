Hey, its Zini, the guy who never seems to make part 2s for things.  The latest way I've spent my free time is monkeying around with alphabets.  In my current pursuit to strengthen the quality of linguistic within the setting, I put together a runic alphabet for old nordic.

Now, before anyone says 'well what about draconic?': Draconic is not an old nordic rune alphabet.  It is an alphabet that within the setting was used for the dragon language by dragons and by the ruling dragon cult elite for the dragon language.  It is not suited to express nordic phonemes, and has not been used in the setting for anything but draconic.  Nords and nordic language has been known to use a rune script tailored around northern speech, described by Aicantar of Shimmerene as being supposedly created by Ysgramor himself, and ESO also has depicted old nordic runestones with a definitely non-draconic character set.

This Runic alphabet has 29 characters: B, O, D, V, Y, R, K/C, G/Kh, L, A, F, S, Z/Ts, M, N, E, H, J as in Mjolnir, J as in John, I, W/Uu, Aa, T, Ng, U, Th, X, P, Ch, and Sch/Sh.  These characters are tailored to nordic language and the phonemes present within it, and I made sure they could be used to spell out naturally and without unnatural digraphs the natively nordic names of deities and old heroic figures.

These runes were inspired mostly by futhark, and many are borrowed from a mix of elder futhark, younger futhark, old italic, and gothic.  Many are also entirely original, and several do not necessarily represent phonemes they do in real life.

Take this alphabet as you will; use it for your own reference, don't use it for your own reference, either's fine by me.  I just wanted to share it.  I'll be posting a sample of it in use as well in a bit, so people can see it function and also have a go at trying to read/decipher it.
