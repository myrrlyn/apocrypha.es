As promised [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/7uew8v/old_nordic_bodvyr_rune_script_a_rune_alphabet_for/) this is the runic alphabet I've scribbled up in action.  These are names of some notable nords in the lore, rendered in old nordic form, both in language and in script.  I won't outright tell you who they are, so why don't you try to decipher what each one says in the comments.

A Note: the revised version of the character for U can be seen in this, in the second to last name.  It is the second character in the second part of that name.
