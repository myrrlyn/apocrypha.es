#11: Valdar the Far Sighted (1E 110 â€” 1E 123) 

*by High Chronicler Valerius of Winterhold*

---
Valdar the Far Sighted, also known as the Scribe-King, was the younger brother of High King Vundheim, and was known thought the kingdom as both a wise and learned scholar. He commanded great respect within his clan and was named his brother's successor after his assassination.

The kingdom he inherited was plagued by infighting between [the tripartite ruling class](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/User:Jimeee/Fiction/YsgramorDynasty#Family_Tree). The reasons were numerous, but the largest division among them was one side's desire for further conquest versus the other's appeal to strengthen the kingdom from within. The legacy of every king, since the time of Ysgramor, loosely fit into one of the two philosophies. 

Conqueror-kings, such as Heimverlund, Einarth and Hjonskar, were lauded for expanding Skyrim's borders, bringing her much wealth and staying true to Ysgramor's Decree. Nation-builders, such as Ylgar, Valdimar, Vundheim became much loved for building infrastructure and improving the lives of their subjects.

As Ysgramor's Dynasty grew in size, so it became increasingly difficult for the royal family to agree of matters of ruling. Indeed, many speculated that his brother's assassination was ordered from within the royal family itself, due to his strong views on suspending expansion.

There was hope that Valdar's great wisdom and foresight would mend the rifts, as he was neither conqueror or builder. He was a sage and a devotee of Jhunal. His famed white robes were replete with the enchanted feathers of the snow owl (in mimicry of the Jhunal's totem animal) and were said to grant him prescient powers. Several eddas make reference to his unnatural ability of scrying the tides of fate and divining future events with great accuracy, including the betrayal of [Magus Haldir](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Halldir's_Cairn), The [White Flood](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:White_River) of 1E 98 and even his own brother's assassination.

He was said to always carry with him a large black grimoire and a white stave hewn from the branch of a great frost-oak. Ysgramor supposedly brought hundreds of frost-oak cuttings with him from Atmora and planted these throughout his new kingdom, however a scarce few survived the Dragon War. When the frost-oak matured, it was said to swell with potent frost magic that Atmoran woodcrafters could harness and create powerful staves, although none exist today.

#Forbidden Knowledge
Valdar's early reign was incredibly successful and historians largely agree that he saved the kingdom from civil war. His methods of mediating conflicts were supposedly unconventional, but almost always resulted in success. Within the first five years of his rule he had resolved almost all disputes between the ruling family and established treaties between them and their Holds. In turn, all three Houses of Skerd renewed their fealty to the crown.  

As the years passed, Valdar became more and more reclusive as he spent months in the Royal Archives pouring over tomes and annals from the era of the Dragon Cult. So much so that his Housecarl, Mjoll Asbjornsen, was eventually forced to assume the day-to-day running of his court.

Valdar was fascinated by his ancestor, Totem-King Heimverlund, and the powerful masks he and the other High Priests of the cult wore. Although countless texts from that era were burned when King Valdimar's overthrew the priesthood, numerous manuscripts were uncovered over the years. Even owning such texts were completely prohibited under law, save for those in the Royal Archives. Valdar was treading dangerous ground by seeking such forbidden knowledge. Had he been a commoner, he would have accused of being a dragon cultist and immediately executed. Nordic historians have traditionally hand-waved this blatant double standard with assertions that Valdar's intentions were "for the good of the kingdom" and the like.

Perhaps most damning are his fragmented journals, regarded by many Nords as treasonous fabrications, which possibly reveal a much darker purpose:

&gt;*18th Frostfall 1E 121*

&gt;*...the last text I translated chronicles the Totem-King's anointment, but no mention of the mask... I feel I am close but this pitiful archive is missing what I need... O had my dim-witted predecessors preserved these valuable texts instead of destroying them I would have the answer by now.*

&gt;*12th Rain's Hand 1E 122*

&gt;*Progress is slow. For months I hath sent scavengers to every decrepit temple to find more texts, and they produce nothing of use! I must have unearthed every accursed ruin in this land searching for the mask's whereabouts... I may have no choice but to accept Herma Mora's bargain, but I am no fool. I know he will attempt to betray me, but I will be prepared when the time comes.*

&gt;*1st Rain's Hand 1E 123*

&gt;*...The Totem-King was indeed wise. I found the old shrine in the ruins of Bromjunaar, but nary magic nor might could break it open. I know it's in there. I could not wait any longer. I gave the vile Daedra the [text missing] he sought, and in return he hath granted unto me the knowledge to unlock the shrine. A simple wooden mask, carved in mimicry of the legendary masks of old. He claims its imbued with the very essence of dragonkind, but to unlock its power I must don the mask within the ancient sanctuary itself... There shall be no more delays. Konahrik will be mine!*

Consorting with Daedra was a most grievous crime indeed, and had been enforced since the rule of Ysgramor when he warned his people of his dealings with the Woodland Man on Atmora. For a High King (of the Harbinger's very bloodline no less) to carry out such an act is unfathomable to Nords who unsurprisingly reject the journal as an "Imperial forgery" created to sully the King's good name. I leave it to you, dear reader, to draw your own conclusions.

Regardless, in 1E 123 King Valdar was last seen leaving Windhelm in the dead of night upon his steed and heading east. His royal guard was said to have pleaded with him to take an armed escort, but Valdar forbid anyone to follow on penalty of death. Before the royal family could be alerted of his departure it was too late. He disappears completely from the historical records thereafter.

The royal court was left in disarray, but before the Skerd could descend back into infighting Thane Haknir the Baleful - grandson of the great Hjonskar the Wolf - assumed the throne.
