Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

In battle, the true Orcs are forged

And in war the dishonourable cast down;

But here these words, you are urged

Or else in foolish ignorance drown!

Of war, there are types of three:

On heresy!

On the weak!

On the mortal enemy!

The former two are internal;

Ever focused on the Orcs young and old.

Purging the weak from the stronghold

Cleansing the soul for Ashpit eternal!

For heresy is the deepest threat:

That any Orc that spurns our father

Who does shout "false demon" or he does abet

Must be purged else no glory will the stronghold harbour.

And under Mauloch's holy code

Shall no unripe fruit be beared or be born

For else, Mauloch, he will scorn

When the stronghold cannot bear a heavy load.

The third type, builder of strength it is

Is nothing but a fool's barren mine 

If an Orc's soul is not as clean as his

For a warring soul is as inefficient as an archer blind.
