&gt;That all the Interplay is one flea of assertion on a wolf of naught... -Excerpt from [et'Ada, Eight Aedra, Eat the Dreamer](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/etada-eight-aedra-eat-dreamer)

Time and Space

I AM and I AM NOT

I AM I AM NOT =?= I AM LHKAN

I AM NOT I AM =?= I AM NOT AKHAT

Who's the Flea making the Assertion? Who's the Wolf that doesn't Exist?

Is it the Grey Prince of Order who brings Change? Or is the Void-Shaped Hole that seeks to Preserve the world? 

Just You wait and see. Good Gods come and go. All Lords eventually fall. A God can wake up mortal.

Lo and Behold! Anu birthed his soul for it was Dragonborn! And they called it Anuiel. Lo and Behold! Anuiel birthed his soul for it was Dragonborn! And they called it Time.

Lo and Behold! Padomay birthed his soul for it was Shezarrine! And they called it Sithis! Lo and Behold! Sithis birthed his soul for it was Shezarrine! And they called it Space. 

MAYBE!!! Her name was MAYBE!!! *Birth* and *Death*. Birth *and* Death. Enantiomorph.  

Spin the Wheel, see the Tower. I will be Free. Free from Me. Free from We. I AM WE. WE ARE WE.

Lorkhan's Lie. Sheogorath's Lie. Nothing can Change nothing. Order *must* Change everything. Eternity allowed the Day. Forwards, backwards...relevant to what? When? Where? MAYBE?

Shor, Son of Shor! Alduin, Firstborn of Akatosh! 

The two heads. Always the two heads. The Blood of the Red Jewel. In the Weft and Weave of Dragon scales, the Drum goes DOOM. 

And it's name is Satakal.
