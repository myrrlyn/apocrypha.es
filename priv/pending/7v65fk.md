Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

The metal does not wait for the hammer to fall,

Nor does the fly sit idle while the spiders do crawl,

So do not be frozen with foolish fear 

While adversity stalks the land like a sharpened spear.

When adversity strikes

Know that faith in Mulak is your armour;

That the rewards you reap being a fate-farmer

Shall pierce your foes hearts like a great pike.

For adversity is the test of strength from Mauloch,

That his children have will and mind of bedrock

Or else no place in Ashpit has he for thee

For those who are weak of will and soul stained tawny.
