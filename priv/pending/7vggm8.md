The following is a link to the original google document which includes some footnotes and an appendix with arguments I had intended for Bethesda.

[Alik'rian Nights:
 Volume The First](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GTjEOQmyZ1CbKqsu2clOtPfTeoolpRD-fiENFVV5Ji0/edit?usp=sharing)

My deepest thanks to those who read the whole story; I know it's long. I'm eager to hear your opinions and reviews regarding the story and its use of lore as well as thoughts and suggestions for improvement.

Some questions:    
Was the connections between all the varied elements such as Dwarves, Towers, Lorkhan, the Creation Myth, ect. clearly shown as naturally flowing from of the same mega-narrative?     
Were you pleased with how I treated the subject of the Towers? I was seeking to end their tale in such a way that didn't involve annihilating the universe as is commonly expected. It wasn't enough to merely save the Adamantine Tower this time, because somebody would eventually come to knock it down.     
What about the treatment of things like the Dwarves? The appearance, actions, and death of Vivec? Tiber Septim? The Psijjic Endeavor and CHIM? Aldmeris?     
Did you catch the echos to Lorkhan's tale and betrayals? Were the betrayals done well?    
What did you think of Nihilangelo and his arguments?    
How about how he was defeated? Being a student of Heath Ledger's Joker, I didn't want the battle for Tamriel's soul to be decided in a fistfight with the hero. Dagon in Oblivion is beaten in a fist fight with Martin, Alduin is defeated in a fist fight with the Dragonborn. I wanted to defeat the villain differently; prepositionally. I wanted him murdered by metaphor.    
Do you have any questions, or was there anything you didn't understand?    
Was the story too long, or too brief? Does it leave you overwhelmed with everything it contains?

I was thinking that the story would give ya'll a great deal to talk about, but really nobody's said much. Were you waiting to see how it turned out, or was it really not that interesting? Does anyone care if there are further volumes?
