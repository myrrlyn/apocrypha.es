My dearest Viarmo,

As you know, I have eschewed the normal path of the bard to wander the wilds of Skyrim, seeking inspiration in adventure in order to contribute something new to the considerable, if somewhat stale, collection of material available at the College.  I realize this has caused you some consternation, yet I hope that, in the end, you will agree it pumped new lifeblood into our vocation.

To that end, I must tell you about a recent experience.  I was traveling from Whiterun to Rorikstead when I took the wrong path.  I found myself at an ancient graveyard (the locals say it may have been a place they call Hamvir's Rest) late at night and was confronted by a equally wondrous and disturbing sight.  There were skeletons moving about.  But, not just moving ... dancing.  

This was something completely out of my experience, so I had to investigate.  I was just able to make out another figure amidst the gloom.  She was wearing dark robes and a hood so voluminous it covered her face, and was acting as a combination puppet master, conductor and choreographer; directing her thralls to dance to a silent song, or perhaps one which played only in her ear.

Obviously, this was a necromancer.  Yet, I had never heard of a necromancer having such skill or using it for such a purpose.  I was mesmerized and watched for no small amount of time until, fearing discovery, I left while she was still occupied by her work.  

The sight so enthralled me, for lack of a better term, that I composed a song on the spot.  I'm thinking of calling it *The Necromancer's Hymn* or *The Necromancer's Waltz*.  Or something else.  Perhaps you could assist in this matter.  Here are the lyrics.  The melody is still a work in progress.  Imagine it sung in 3/4 time in a minor key.

I remain, once and always, your student;

Talsgar, the Wanderer

-----------------------------------

If, at the witching hour, you stray  
Close to the bone-yard when the day  
has fallen into night, you may  
See a spectral sight  
There, along the wraithlike way  
By Masser's ruby light.  

Gazing with her glistening glance  
She lulls the night into a trance  
And skeletons come out to dance  
Beneath Secunda's gaze  
Around the dew-touched stones they prance  
All through the misty haze.

Graceful, spinning, pale limbs whirling  
In unison, the couples curling  
As the eldritch hour unfurling  
At its measured pace  
Counts the steps, and dancers twirling  
Move with ghastly grace  

As the hour wanes to a close  
The dancers, as the moonlight glows,  
Begin to sing, their dancing slows,  
A song sung without breath.  
The silent music from them flows,  
A hymn of thanks to Death.

"Hail, dark freedom, Thee we praise  
To you, eternal end of days  
This grateful strain to you we raise  
For freedom from foul life.  
That burden on the living weighs,  
While we are free from strife."

So, at the witching hour, beware  
If near the boneyard you should dare  
To stray, beneath the moon's soft glare,  
The dancers by the door  
Will take you to their earthy lair  
To stay forever more.

-----------------------

PS. I should note that I attempted to perform a rough version of this song in Rorikstead.  They did not respond well.  I don't know if it was the music or the subject matter, but the audience was tepid at best and, at worst, I may have narrowly avoided an unpleasant end that evening.  Perhaps I should have stuck with *Ragnar the Red.*
