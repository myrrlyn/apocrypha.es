Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

Do not fear the darkness at the close

Nor go meekly into it as it approaches

For, if you fall in honour and piety, Mauloch knows

And shall you be armoured against all mortal reproaches!

For in Ashpit shall you feast and drink

And spar with all the past warlords of glory

That you could never count to think

Of the beauty of your one thousand wives so saucy.

For the honour death is but a reward due for duty

That is more beautiful that an endless pile of booty.

But those who are blanketed in dishonour

Shall never rise nor from their crimes be exonerated.
