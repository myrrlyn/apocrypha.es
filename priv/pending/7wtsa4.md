*[from the Apographa of Holamayan as told by Malur Omayn, Dissident Priest]*

After a great victory against the Prolix-Chimopteron of the Eastern Seas, Vivec the Master was celebrating with his Armigers. When the festivities neared its climax, he took three of his Marshals into an alcove to create beautiful poetry. After rejoicing the marriage of prosody and meat, he proposed a game to nargile and shein: 

"Compare me to someone and I will tell you why I resemble his image."

"Master, you are like Mphaal of the Black Hands", the First Armiger said. "You are the Bifold Son-Daughter of Two-in-Three, Law of the Ancient Forest, the Truthful Ministrel, Cloud in the Inner Sea, Mirage of the Middle Air and Syntagma older than Night."

At this the Master smiled, but said nothing. 

"Master, you are are like Veloth the Prophet", the Second Armiger said. "You are the Dream-Walker of the Endeavour, Uncertain Princeps of Abjection, Miles Incalculable, Sideways Blade of Chim-bal-a and Invisible Gate to the Scented Garden."

At this the Master smiled, but said nothing. 

"Master, you are like Almsivi of the Holy Name", the Third Armiger said. "You are the Three, Six and Nine, the Truth in the Whole and beyond that the Axiom of Mara, ancestral Tribunate of the True People, Mirror of Miasma, Soul Anterior and Divine Presence whose Sacred Feet tread softly in dust and doom and at the ending of worlds.‚Äù

At this the Master smiled, but said nothing. And more things were said to his honor, and the praise and riddles of the Armiger Marshals multiplied and spinned around in a furious sword-dance of satisfaction. Silently, Vivec stole away from the celebration. 

"I am not your Master", Vivec the Thief said.
