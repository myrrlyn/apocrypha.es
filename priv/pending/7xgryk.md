Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

Mauloch gave us strength in life:

So damn he who in the face of adversity 

does not ride the measured wave of strife

And in weak-will falls on his own blade.

Mauloch, in his transformation 

gave us thick skin to endure

And for one to be pierced

Is their own enfeebled and flawed fault.

All those who submit to the army of strife

Shall not bathe in Ashpit's glory

Nor be worthy of Malak's love

For the weak and feeble are never revered in story.
