So you want to visit High Rock - A Nords Guide to High Rock.


So you want to travel but you wish to avoid a long and boring journey, well then simply travel to our Western neighbours and visit High Rock and it is with great pleasure that I announce that High Rock is not full of Elves, but I will address that later. You may think that with it's name the province would be nice and mountain-y, just like home. However there are few, if any High Rocks around here, thankfully I have solved the meaning of the name. You see ,Bretons are very small and so to them a small hill may appear as an impossibly tall mountain, so speaking relatively any rock is a High Rock compared to their minute stature.


How to Get There. 


Walk you lazy milk-drinkers, it's a simple climb over the Druadach Mountains and then you're there. If you run into any Forsworn on the way kill the damn Daedra worshippers and then carry on your way. A bunch of angry midgets in furs shouldn't be able to stop a light breeze let alone a Nord. If you are a bit lazy but not a total snow-back then you can walk the northern road to Jehanna, and check in on our cousins who have to live with the eternal shame of living in a province ruled by a bunch of half-Elves. If living as a self respecting Nord is completely against your nature take the easy way and hop on ship. Daggerfall , Jehanna, Wayrest and Northpoint are all by the sea so you'll have no shortage of destinations. Daggerfall is the greatest city in all of High Rock, which is unsurprising as it was built by Nords. Northpoint is also quite a nice town with very high cliffs which are useful if you want to throw any Elves into the sea.


The Locals


Bretons seem decent enough folk, sure they're short and actually like magic but at least they're not Elves , right? Wrong, they have some Elf in them and that makes them treacherous. They constantly betray each other, fighting over their pathetic little "kingdoms". They are a race of Man so treat them with respect but always keep your wits about you. If in doubt remember the rhyme. " If it's ears a knife, then end it's life". Also I'm not entirely sure Bretons aren't just little Elves disguised as Men so always watch your back around them. The Wrothgar region of High Rock is home to the Orcs, so if for some reason you want to see more of those ugly Elves than visit here. From what I hear the Orcs aren't very good at building as every city they've built has fallen over. Which is odd as their armour is quite strong, I suppose not every race can master all crafts as us Nords have. 


What to Do. 


I'll be honest with you, High Rock is pretty much like Skyrim but more boring. No big mountains to climb, no giants to fight with and not enough other Nords to fight/drink with. Perhaps you could visit the site of Glenumbra Moors and pay your respects to the fallen king Hoag Merkiller, who died fighting the Allesian Order here. Bretons keep them selves entertained by betraying each other and laying siege to Orsinium, but beyond that I'm not sure what else they do. I asked a local Breton what places I should visit and he gave me a comprehensive guide of all places of interest in High Rock. However I lost the book in a scuffle with some Orcs who took offense to my writings. But I remember a couple of the places so here goes. In Glenumbra there is the great Wyrd Tree, a giant tree inhabited by a bunch of women who apparently worship some nature gods, I intended to convert them to the worship of the Nordic gods but I couldn't find the tree so I'll leave that task to some other adventurous Nord. 
There is also the Shrieking Scar, a bunch of cliffs infested with Harpies. I discovered that Harpies have knife-ears like Elves and so took appropriate action. On an unrelated note if any one would like genuine harpy feather quills, I have quite a number to sell. There is a large coven of Azura worshippers in Stormhaven, I visited them to mock them for worshipping a Dunmer God and although they weren't particularly fond of me, they still gave me some drink so they are alright in my book. There is also a large bridge connecting Stormhaven and Bangkorai, although it isn't as impressive as Dragon Bridge, I was surprised Bretons could build something so large given their short stature. 



So there you have it, a land of half-elves and not enough high rocks. There isn't much to do and there isn't much mead so it's not hard to see why the old Nordic Empire abandoned this place. In summary, positives not many Elves to annoy me. Negatives, not many Elves to kill.
