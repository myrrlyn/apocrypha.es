Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

Malacath gave his children the words of marriage

So that the youth may be blessed in his glory.

That the strong may sow the sacred seeds

And weed and rip out the weak from all the world.

But like the blossoming of the ripened fruit

The strong shall wield the scythe like the sword

And - striking while the hammer is hot

Forsake the ceremony until the yield is tilled

And the strength of the yield is tested;

The strength of the plants allows them 

To encompass the world!

To become the Chief!

To weed out the weak!
