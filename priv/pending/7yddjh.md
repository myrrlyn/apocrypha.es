Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

Oh, days past spent in glory's wonder

Of Malak's love and his children's victories;

They are spun, spoken and sung in Ashpit's longhouse

But if they are not told on the land they as meaningless as the 
light touch of a mouse!

For years upon years - over a hundred holy years,

Mauloch's children have kept their past a present!

They never shall forget their writhing creation -

For their foes shiver at fevered stories of embolden rage!

Sing the songs of triumphs past in the longhouse!

Have it remembered forever in daily prayer!

Etch it on parchment - in blood if needs must

For it shall be etched into our enemies sleeping minds!
