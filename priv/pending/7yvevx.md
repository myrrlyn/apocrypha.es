Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

How the creation of Malak and his children is       

Remembered by all those who are in glory's reign!

But their are those who in their writhing existence yell "false demon"

Shall hear now of their insolence and that of Trinimac!

The wandering Aedroth, Trinimac - Lorkhan's bane

Walked and talked and preached ignorance amongst the people

But in a arrogant fight against Veloth's flight

He was consumed by the bastardly Boethiah.

From his paled weakness and his naivety

Trinimac's loathing acidly corrupted to green;

From weakness to awesome strength

Arose Malacath from the dung of the fool.

Hear of Malak's transformative virtures!

Weakness to strength!

Arrogance to modesty!

Foolishness to wisdom!
