*The author and the exact date of this poem is unknown, though scholars place it about late First Era.*


For though your duties are to the children of New,

Your nature is to the home of your forefathers.

And though your heart yearns,

for further shores

And though your desire compels you,

for something real

Sanctuary can be found,

within your home, within your Law.


Do not run away my glorious child of Old,

For though illusion call you,

and you ask us “Do you feel it?”

And though desire needs you,

and you ask us “Surrender to me. Come with me.”

We cannot come with you,

on this wild journey.


I plead with you my devil child of Old,

Stay home.

Ignore the callings of the devils and demons,

Ignore the drunken pleasures of their offers

Forget the screams of your soul,

Suffuse yourself in Law and Gold and Apathy.


We will leave you,

If you leave us.

Yours will be out,

As we stay within.

You cannot awaken my beloved monster-child of Old,

Come back to the life that holds you,

To the People true and golden.


We plead with you,
 
Do not run away.
