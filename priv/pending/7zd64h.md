Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

How! The 'beautiful' in their castled towns

Adorned in fragrant silk and made-up skin

And strutting with pruned feathers;

How! Feathered birds are but easy targets!

The children of Malak are pariahs abound

By fate and by faith in the thick hide of piety

That no beautiful skin is needed

When one has a beautiful soul!

An honourable life best a beautiful appearance

For the 'beautiful people' will see ugliness regardless

Of all the honourable children of Malacaths' acts

And fail to see the truth of their absolute beauty!

**Sermons that are a Work In Progress**

**On Hunting**

**On Sickness**
