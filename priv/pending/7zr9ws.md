Greetings, Cherished children of Malacath 

It is time for more teaching of our fathers will - Today, I will outline some of the vital qualities that a strong and victorious leader must have!

The Chief - the leader of a tribe of Orcs - must fulfil certain criteria, in order to fulfil the demanding tasks that are required of him. A Chief must:

- Be Strong, but know the limits of his strength.

- Be Assertive, but not domineering.

- Be Headstrong, but not foolish.

- Be Mindful, but not absorbed in any singular subject.

- Be Pious, but not inattentive of the mortal world.

- Be Ruthless in tactics, but not cruel.

- Be Proud, but not overcome with pride.

- Act with initiative, but not to the path that leads to dishonour.

- Be fruitful, but not with those who would provide weak kin.

If a leader does not fulfil these requirements, then they do not deserve to lead - thus, they should be have their authority challenged! If they do not accept this challenged, then they are even more dishonourable, for it is better to accept a challenge and fail than to decline and live in the shadow of Malak's wrath!

Farewell until next time, Cherished Children of Malak!
