Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

Malak dictated that his children must be self-sufficient

And no job is better shown in its tailoring tools

In facing the slings and arrows of life

Than the bows and the traps of the hunter!

Speed, stealth, precision - such skills are tempered in the wild 
woods;

Like iron, the soul is melded with the earth!

Like the battle, the hunt reveals the true self!

Like prayer, the hunt brings health to the soul!

Much meat to feed and sustain the strength of warriors!

Many hides to soon block a killing blow!

Knowledge of berries to aid in future furrowers!

To keep the Cherished safe with blade and bow!
