**What subject do you want a 'Sermon on Orcish Issues' to cover next**

Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

The Fall of foolish Trinimac speaks volumes,

More than an endless library of timeless tomes

In the history of weakness and ignorance;

Although the Orcs were the students and Malacath the reaping

Boethia was not the teacher that sowed the seeds of knowing.


The dastardly Boethia in seeing the ignorance of Trinimac

Played the fool in wearing his skin and speaking his voice

But his corrupting bile did not make Malacath:

For it was the humiliation and self-learningthat changed the Orcs.


It is not the teacher's act that the lesson is taught

But the self-reflection and the self-sight 

In awareness to know that a lesson is being taught

That reaps the sown seeds of knowledge to yield!
