#**Guild Cant: Code-Talkers**

*By Anonymous Lexicologist*

*1st edition, dated Year 200 of the 4th Era*

---

*Author’s Foreword*

The Thieves Guild is **not** a myth.
It is understandable as to why one might believe that, as they are a secretive fraternity of lawbreakers who go to many extensive and bizarre lengths to conceal their activities and inner functioning from non-members. The Guild *wants* you to believe that they are a fable, and their mythos is but one clandestine weapon they utilize against the unsuspecting masses. That is, in part, what this publication entails. My safety and standard of living would likely be imperiled if I were to indulge in all I have learned of their dealings, and it is otherwise against my interests as well. This tome is not an endeavor to subvert the Guild, but rather, it is a publication of a certain topic that intrigues me.

Lexicography and linguistics are passions of mine, and as a scholar of such subjects, I have been salaried by numerous ministries and private proprietors from all over Tamriel to translate manuscript of various languages, both living and dead. I’ll admit that my studies have become tedious over the years, but recently, a stirring new task has sparked the flame in my heart for speechlore! That is the case that the Imperial Watch has presented me with.
Here in the woefully marred Imperial City, once the Jewel of the Rumare, the now convalescing Imperial Watch are struggling terribly against the criminal underworld that has been emboldened by the chaos that the war left behind. The outlaws who have been preying on the wretched state of order have been nearly uncontested in recent years by the law, and now their organizations have only become more complex.

I thought them disorganized, personally, but when an agent of the Watch approached me with several documents belonging to illicit smugglers and incarcerated master thieves, and then requested that I translate, I was taken aback by this new discovery. It consisted of seemingly random, nonsensical use of words from several dialects that appeared devoid of meaning without context. Even more extraordinarily, several words appear to be entirely original, with no other vernacular means to trace their origin. Thieves in this city have invented their own language!

It’s what is known in linguistic circles as a *cant* or a *cryptolect*, a collection of code words and lingo in place of diction that might otherwise alert authorities or bystanders to their illegal activity. The extent of the phrasing, however, is beyond the complexity of any slang that I have witnessed in my time and I have reservations in labeling it just a simple use of underclass patois. It has been created with the sole purpose of *ciphering* their speech, so as non-Guild persons cannot comprehend them. Absolutely fascinating!

Hence, this book will serve as a dictionary for the terms that I have interpreted so far. More editions will be published shortly, as the *“Guild Cant”* –as I’ve coined it– is continually developing as you read this sentence.

It saddens me somewhat that I will not be able to personally claim the title of the academic who annotated the Guild’s strange argot, but such is the nature of such underground affairs, and that tinge of romanticism is not lost on me.

**J**
 
Jawdack – A jeering term for an overly superstitious thief, or an avid worshipper of Nocturnal. I believe the term to be associated directly with the *"Jackdaw"*, a common blackbird. My reasoning is that ravens, crows, and other such black-plumed family of icteridae birds are related to religious imagery of Nocturnal. As the name is inverted, I imagine this insinuates that the thief in question is *"backwards"* in his beliefs. ex: *“He won’t do the job, says it’s ‘bad luck’. What a jawdack.”*
 
Jing – Stolen coins or money, in the sense that it *“jingles in your pocket”*.
 
Joke – A lock on a chest or a door. ex: *“We’ll need a draw-latch to tig that joke.”*

Jukrum – Booty, bounty, stolen goods. This entry is particularly interesting, as it appears to be a rough transliteration of an Old Cyrodillic word meaning incandescent or shiny of the 2nd Era. How it came to common use in this age is an enigma.

---
 
**K**
 
Kaddey – On board, or up to a challenge. The term is derivative of a Ta'agra term, particularly of the Pa'alatiini dialect.  ex: *“You think you’re kaddey to this, ketch?”*
 
Ketch – A fool, especially someone who gets themselves into trouble when they should know better. The origin is unclear, but it appears to be a Cyrodilic parlance of some vague Dunmeri influence (possibly Alt Redoranis?).
 
Kiss – A pry bar or similar lever tool. ex: *“Hand me the kiss.”*
 
Knock Knock – An informal greeting in place of hello.

When overheard in conversation by untrained ears, Guild Cant can be particularly difficult to follow, much to the advantage of footpads everywhere. As an example, consider this typical discussion between two thieves, which would likely take place in a public place like a pub or tavern.  
 
**EXAMPLE CONVERSATION**

Thief #1: “*Knock knock*! Me an’ ‘Rough-Dog’ was just *flag wavin’* to *visit the neighbors* in the town *show*. Silas is our *draw-latch* and is already *kaddey* to it. We lookin’ fer a fourth *gentleman* for *wren. Giddy?*”
 
Thief #2: “*Cut the chant and glass me*. What kind of *lukrum* ya wanna *nim*? How’s your *uncle?*”
 
Thief #1: “*Uncle’s out of town*, we’re going to pick *jing* at *thumbs*.”
 
Thief #2: “In *show*? That’s *fat-lady*. Sounds too *boring*, and I ain’t your *able* when yer *snapt*. I’m *comfy*.”
 
**TRANSLATION**

Thief #1: *“Hello! ‘Rough-Dog’ and I were planning on burglarizing shops in the Market District. Silas can lockpick for us, and he has already agreed to it. We’re looking for a fourth thief to act as a lookout. Interested?”*
 
Thief #2: *“Hold on, I want details. What kind of loot are you going to steal? Who’s your fence?”*
 
Thief #1: *“We don’t need a fence. We are going for septims only, during midnight.”*
 
Thief #2: *“From the market? That’s heavy work. The job sounds too risky, and I will not be an accessory to your crime when you are apprehended. I’m not interested.”*
