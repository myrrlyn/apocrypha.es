[This document appears to be a Altmeri collection of intelligence and requests on notable criminals around the Abecean Sea. One in particular catches your eye.]

**Security Level**: Altaedra

**Date Submitted**: 2E 553, 16th of Sun's Height

**Submitted by**: Sorcalin Graybinder, Firsthold Naval Intelligence


**Subject**: Casnar Leki

**Known Aliases**: The Singer of Stros M'Kai, Dread Pirate Leki

**Known Crimes**: Piracy, Destruction of Alinori property, Insurrection, Smuggling, Mer-Trafficking

**Race**: Redguard

**Age**: 43

**Status**: Active

**Magical Proficiency**: Illusion(Presumed)

**Threat Level**: High

**Recommendation**: Termination


**Report**: *For the past 7 years, Casnar Leki has been sailing the Abecean in his ship, "The Silver Storm." His crew have been successful in destabilizing Hammerfell and Cyrodiil, proliferating skooma into Rihad and engaging in the second torching of Anvil. He has made himself into a human boogeyman, with survivors of his attacks spreading tales of rain made of phantasmal knives, shadowy creatures in the corners of their eyes, and sudden silence. With these actions, we have in the past viewed him as a useful asset in our long-term goals, feeding his crew port security information through covert operatives along Hammerfell's southern coast. His usefulness, however, is beginning to wane.*

*In the past year, he and his crew have decided to enter the slave trade. He has engaged in the trafficking of Bosmer and Altmer, selling them to Redguard crown nobles, his fellow pirates, sload, and, though we have been unable to verify first-hand, to Maormer. Mer serving Men or being used as Sload experiments is bad enough, but the possibility of being sold to Maormer becomes a national security risk. If any of our agents are captured and sold to the tropical brutes, it could trigger a chain reaction leading to Maormer storming the capitol. For this reason, my recommendation at this time is changed to termination. Rather than a simple assassination, however, I propose we use him as a test run for the Dwenevir Sapphire-Fleet. While it may seem overkill, utilizing cutting-edge Altmeri ocean-smithing against a potential Maormer collaborator seems more than fitting. Additionally, if our fleet is in any way damaged, the test will inform us of its practicality.*
