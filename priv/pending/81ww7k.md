Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

Mauloch commands his children work with their due

For to thrive they must aid themselves in this world;

Thus, if they must work the earth, then they must work the earth

For meat and bread is fuel enough for the bodies internal tempering forge.


To those who mock the tools that are used -

"The plough is to the community as the hammer is to the sword"

Ever strengthening its power and endurance

For a dead starved Orc is more a fool than an dead unarmed one.

The toils of the earth teaches one their dues

For it preaches to never submit to nature's might

And to spit in adversity's smug smiling face

For we are Mauloch's children, pariahs but never beaten.
