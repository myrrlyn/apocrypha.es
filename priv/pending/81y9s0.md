*The Tamriel Journal of History* was established on 1 Morning Star, 4E 201 by a group of multi-discipline historians at the Imperial University in Cyrodiil, with the aim of furthering the knowledge of Tamriel's countless scholars in a manner that is peer-reviewed, informative, reliable, and circulated as widely and as cheaply as possible. Thus, the subscription price of this journal, distributed annually in the month of Morning Star, will be set at 100 septims for a two-year subscription, and 75 septims for a one-year subscription.

It is with a great hope and respect for the scholarly community of Tamriel that this journal is printed and distributed, and with an equal hope and expectation that it is well received as such.

**- Morven Ashwing, General Editor, Morning Star, 4E 202.**
