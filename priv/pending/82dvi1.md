Mauloch, Father to us, his children

Gave us strength, endurance and passion

That we may crush our foes and love our kin;

Under your guidance, we have no fear!

Malak dictated the Stronghold Tenet

To give the tribe a prescribed order

And likewise the family the same treatment

For the tribe is made up of all kin's souls.

The tribe is a family - 

But when is a family not a tribe?

When discord is sowed and reaped in full

And when treachery and dishonesty reigns.

The tribe is a family bound by blood

But also bound by the fires of friendship

Forged between blood-kin in the battle of life

And permeates the colour of Orc skin hides.

Kin is who you take on 

Not who you have to displace

Through dishonour's poisoned chalice

But those who bathe in Malacath's glory.
